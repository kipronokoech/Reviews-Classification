While fees remain low"ish" the speed of transfer has become longer. Why would this be? Could be hanging on to our money for overnight rates or interest. It\'s just a thought. What took only seconds in the past has now turned to 22 hours. Finally found a phone number (which wasn\'t easy) and called. The only question I asked was simple. "why so long this time?" Never received an answer. Was always "could be this" or "could be that". I kept the pressure up and repeated, "exactly what is the problem?". Never an answer. My take on this is written above or it could be that their systems are slow now the business is making squillions of bucks. At the end of the day there was no answer ergo either not telling or problem with systems. I\'m looking for a reliable company to do this and there are lots out there. Service is what the issue will always be in this new millennia. We have all had issues with various companies and it\'s just not good enough. Those who provide consistent, honest, reliable service will win here. Without the bs.\n\nQuote...
