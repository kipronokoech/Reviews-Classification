On this latest occasion my bank held up the transfer for security purposes, i think the change of your bank details might have been the issue. However i suspect you got the money late and therefore would no longer honour the agreed rate. My concern is that instead of contacting me to say the agreed deal was no longer valid and asking me what i wished to do you proceeded with the transfer at a rate less favourable to myself. I am concerned about this action because i did not believe i had agreed to such a course of action.', 'review_date': '2020-12-06', 'review_time': '07:20:45', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
