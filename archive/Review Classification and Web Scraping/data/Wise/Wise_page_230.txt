Niether Myself or my family will be using wise again in the future. The trust I had for the company has been shattered Irreparably and I know longer believe it is a safe or secure way to send funds. In the past Wise have been nothing but helpful and have aimed to assist me with any problem I have had. Not anymore. A Situation has arose where my wife attempted to send a large amount of money from our joint account into her personal Wise account. The following morning I recieved an email to my personal email address stating that Wise had received my money and dont know where to send it. I called to wise to explain that it wasn\'t my money it was my wifes sent from our joint account only to be told that they dont have any money from me. I was asked to forward the email they sent to me back to them i felt as if i was accused of fraudulantly claiming i had an email from them. after they recived a copy of there own email, I was told that they located the money but the only way to recieve it would be to set up a transaction on my personal wise account and then wise would deposit into my account. I tried once again to explain that I had know right to that money as it belongs to my wife the agent insisted I set up a deposit for the same amount and then it would be deposited to me. Reluctantly I did this and was told it would be in my wise account shortly. during this phone call I felt undermined and felt as if I was being accused of some wrong doing. I immediately called my bank to let them know of the current situation. My Bank issued me with an "emergency number" to contact wise with in the event the money does not show up. roll on today and niether my wife or myself have recived the 5000$ that was sent to wise nor has there been an effort made to refund the money back into our joint account despite the initial email stating and I qoute "If you don’t set up a transfer in the next working day, we’ll give you a refund anyway." Back on the phone I was told that the agent needed to email someone else not put me through or contact them directly email them to find out what is happening. Basically I was told again to wait and see what happens in another 3 days. I was then sent an extremely direct email asking me to disclose personal information regarding my account details and the payment made to wise in order to prove I had sent them money. As If I am in some way lieing about the funds being sent that wise themselves had emailed me to say they had. I have now been back on the phone to my bank and have raised the dispute with them in order to get my money back. Unfortunately I can no longer trust Wise to handle my transactions and will be pursuing other means in the future. further more I still do not know where my money is or when I will get it back. It is such a shame that a company that I held in such high regard in the past has sunk this far in a few short years.', 'review_date': '2023-06-20', 'review_time': '21:37:07', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nJun 22, 2023\nHi there!\n\nWe're sorry to hear about the frustration and confusion you've experienced.
