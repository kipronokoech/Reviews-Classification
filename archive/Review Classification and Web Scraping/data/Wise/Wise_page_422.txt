I was a happy customer for 3 years.\n\nI\'ve been stuck in their Indian support center with my case going from one guy to another for 2 months already. The account is blocked because we couldn\'t show any income the past 3-6 months. Their system only accepts 3-6 months of earnings. The earnings were going to Wise directly, but Wise bank statements are not accepted. The bank statements from before the 6-month period are getting rejected because they don\'t check the criteria of being from 3-6 months.\n\nAnd it\'s a legit EU company, sent them the entire bank history and all documents they requested. Now, 2 months later they\'re asking for the same documents they already have.\n\nNo number to call, you\'re at the mercy of their Indian employees who don\'t seem to give a F about anything. The cost time I\'ve spent going back and forth with their Indian A-TEAM is starting to approach the amount of funds that I have in the account.\n\nSo keep in mind - if you have "no earnings" for 6 months on your account, be ready multiple months of back-and-forth with these guys to open it back up again.', 'review_date': '2023-03-31', 'review_time': '18:30:22', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
