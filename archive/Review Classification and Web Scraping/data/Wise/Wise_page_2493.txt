In practice, that means I often get paid in one country/currency, but my expenses are in another: at the moment I am being paid is USD in the US banking system, but I live in Switzerland where I need to pay for things in the Swiss system.\n\nWise provides me a US bank account that I can be paid into, no fuss. I can convert the money to CHF at a very good rate - the only offer that can beat it cannot provide the US bank account. I send the CHF into my Swiss bank account, again at a very reasonable fee, and no need to worry about international (SWIFT) bank transfers.\n\nIn addition, wise provides a debit MasterCard which works in most situations as well.\n\nWhat I would like to see:\nBetter protection of my assets: European and Swiss banks guarantee your account to EUR/CHF 100,000. Wise is licensed in the UK so guarantees nothing, but some best effort amount (in case of insolvency or such). This is why I try to keep my balance in the Wise account low.\n\nSwiss bank details and scheduled transfers between accounts or wallets inside my Wise account would be nice to have.', 'review_date': '2021-12-02', 'review_time': '12:17:11', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

Never had any trouble making transfers. It used to work like a charm, can't even remember how many friends & colleagues I have recommended this to.\nHowever, my recent experiences have been quite opposite.. unnecessary delays, tardy & vague/generic responses from the customer service are getting common these days.\nWise is still good for small transfers (when you pay wise using credit card), however for big ones (when you need to make wire transfer to Wise's account) think twice if you don't want to spend time wondering where has your money gone or chasing Wise customer service for getting a clarity, which you eventually don't get.\nGuaranteed rate is offered for less than 2 days, when Wise takes over 2-3 days just to receive the transferred money and to confirm add another day or two, does it even makes sense to have a guaranteed rate in such scenario. (Wasn't the case before by the way).\nI have a feeling that the reliability, speed and quality of service Transferwise was known for, it seems to be slowly fading away unfortunately.!", 'review_date': '2021-12-02', 'review_time': '10:59:52', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nDec 24, 2021\nHello, Ashish.\n\nWe'd like to get more details on your experience and help you further.
