If I didn\'t, I could possibly lose them. I obviously rushed to save the funds, only to be told that TransferWise needs FOUR DAYS to run some "checks". If my account is terminated in 3 days, and the withdrawal is still pending your checks, then we\'re going to have a big problem.\n\nWhat\'s the point in allowing business accounts in certain countries if you\'re unable to fully support the payment operations of a business in these countries?\n\nTheir customer support is close to useless. Won\'t help you at all, but send you to noreply emails or contact forms that sends out static errors when you try to submit them. Phoning them does you no good. Support reps don\'t seem to have access to any tools or systems to actually troubleshoot your issue.\n\nProbably good for making one-time payments, but if you plan to use TransferWise in the long run, DON\'T. These people are fraudsters, and will do whatever they please with your account and your money if you\'re stupid enough to trust them.

{'platform': 'Wise', 'id': '5fca6a005e693f0704a007bf', 'stars': 1, 'title': 'We were with TransferWise for almost‚Ä¶', 'message': 'We were with TransferWise for almost two years. We have 20,000 customers and did large volumes in transactions with TransferWise. 70% of our payments came through them, and all of a sudden and without prior warnings, we were terminated. The termination email was vague, it said our company was banned due to banking regulations.\n\nWe quickly contacted their chat support. After wasting 20 minutes the rep came to the conclusion that she cannot tell us why we were terminated.\n\nWe then contacted their phone support. The phone rep took a while to "investigate" why, only to come back with a "sorry, we cannot tell you why due to regulations" response. She claimed that she cannot tell me why our company was terminated, and to add insult to injury she said we have three days to move the current funds out of our account or they could be lost (wow). After a ten minute chat, she finally admitted she can\'t even see the reason why we were terminated, not sure why it\'s in TransferWise policies to waste customers time. We would be gladly satisfied with a response that said "I cannot help you, contact a department that will." She pointed us to the appeals department (email contact only) and said it could take ten days for a response.\n\nThings are looking grim because one of our customers also had their account seized today, and their appeals department responded to him right away with a message that said "You were terminated most likely because of [Insert vague reasons here]" They did not disclose why, they only pointed to their Terms of Service. And their appeals rep, Mr. Lee, said at the end (not in those words but same meaning) that we can ban anyone because we can. To quote "see our Terms of Service where we explain how we are allowed to close accounts."\n\nAllowing is one thing, but not having the decency not to say why is appalling. Our company has been using and praising TransferWise since we\'ve discovered it. We referred countless members to their site who use their platform every day. The lack of decency to say why we were terminated, or at least talk to us prior to closing so we could have prepared for this is shocking. We have around 100 pending transactions at the moment, 70 of which came from TransferWise. Our staff spent all day trying to manage the crisis.\n\nTo recap, if you plan to use TransferWise for sending the occasional payment, I\'d say go for it. It\'s cheap and fast. But if you\'re a company who wants to build their e-commerce venture around it, avoid like fire.\n\nSincerely,\nDave - SKYNETINC.\n\nOh, and what kind of financial institution blocks access to records? We need access to statements for our accountant, and we cannot even access that now.\n\nAnd a last-minute edit: In our two years with TransferWise we never once received a complaint or chargeback.', 'review_date': '2020-12-04', 'review_time': '16:57:10', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nDec 7, 2020\nI'm sorry to hear that your account has been deactivated.
