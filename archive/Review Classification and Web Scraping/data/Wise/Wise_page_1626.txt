However, we have recently had 3 payments held up for 'standard financial checks', and I have suppliers who are waiting to receive their money. One of the suppliers has now been waiting 5 work days, or 11 days total due to weekends and 2 bank holidays and they could be waiting for another 3 days for this to be resolved.\n\nThese are suppliers we have paid previously, multiple times, sometimes over a period of years, so it's difficult to understand why there is a problem. I have contacted their customer services twice now and have received vague assurances 'not to worry' but this is inconveniencing my small suppliers who require the money swiftly.\n\nTransferwise need to improve their communication in these instances and give a little more information so we can feed back to the supplier. My expectation is that there should be no reason for unexpected delays; I have certainly never had this issue when dealing with a bank.\n\nUpdate: We got to the 8 days 'max' time for completing checks and then were told it could be another 5-6 days! We cancelled the transfers with Wise and then sent the payment via the bank.\n\nThe following month I contacted their customer service to confirm that all checks (they had stated they were reviewing details of our UBO) had been completed before raising any new payments. They said yes, but when attempting to send further payments we are facing more delays and checks! What is going on Wise, you need to start communicating properly with your customers.\n\nEdit: After all the checks have been completed, service has now returned to normal.\n\nEdit: 03/05/2023\nWe have just had the same issue again with the account where they just suddenly stop paying on time requesting additional information about a new director. The customer services are difficult to contact and this should all be possible to comply and track through the website so you know exactly the status of your account.
