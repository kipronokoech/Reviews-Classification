Understandable due to Due diligence checks.\n\nOut of the blue my account was deactivated without notice or reason, just as I had received payment from one of my regular clients who I consult.\n\nMy account was deactivated on the 31st December 2021, today is the 18th January, my funds have not been refunded to me despite me providing the details to where I want my funds they are holding returning to. They confirmed they would not re activate my account.\n\nCustomer services is useless and pointless as they have zero access to any information about the account and cannot ever give you any relevant information, other than to say sorry ! Pathetic.\n\nSimply put Wise are the modern day Mafia. Holding on to my funds which come from a known source and have been coming from that source for the payment in question for over a year, just so they can earn interest on the funds they are holding! And they do this to hundreds of customers daily! .\n\nSince the 3rd of January all I have repeatedly been told the team is working on refunding my money and can take up to 60 working days while due diligence is being carried out, totally ridiculous what due diligence? The payment was already credited to my account which is the point at which due diligence is carried out, not when they need to refund me!\n\nDO NOT OPEN AN ACCOUNT WITH WISE !
