You save a lot of money in commissions compared to high-street banks; you can pay with either debit or credit card, or even transferring funds from your bank account; Wise tells you exactly how much they’re going to charge from the very beginning and offers you an exchange rate much closer to the exact one at the time of making the payment than the ones offered by other banks and financial providers, and the money reaches your destination account almost immediately. Everything done within seconds and you don’t have to worry at all thinking where your money is, when it is going to arrive or how much you’re going to be charged. Easy, quick, cheap and safe, brilliant! And they have an excellent customer service team. The very few times I contacted them either by phone or by email, they were easy to reach and they dealt with my query kindly, quickly and efficiently.
