So they are holding on to approximately €1m of our cash and our suppliers are all overdue.\n\nI realise that all financial institutions have to regularly update beneficial ownership/KYC information on their clients, but all our banks and other financial partners tend to give 60-90 days to provide information before the threat of freezing accounts, whereas Wise have gone straight in and frozen them with no warning - the payments are all to the same suppliers as in every previous month and for similar amounts, so it's not as if there are any unusual patterns triggering this or payments to suspicious recipients.\n\nCan I speak to someone at Wise to escalate / get this resolved?
