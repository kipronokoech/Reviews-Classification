We’ll review your request and get back to you ASAP via email.\n\nIf you still have money in your account, we'll work on sending it back to you. But first, we need to carry out due diligence checks.

I started to use it because of low transaction costs. But if you have a problem you never find a quick help. They are not aware of what troubles they cause if they don’t solve a problem quickly.\n\nThey paused my transfer which is for 6-months rent and deposit. I couldn’t get the keys from the landlord and stayed outside with my wife and luggages, a lot of stuff so on. We rented airbnb and moved our stuff there. They said that I need to upload some documents to verify my income. Okey No problem, I uploaded the documents immediately and there is no response. They didn’t remove the limitation on the transfer. You don’t get a clear answer from any support agent you talk to. And the problem still goes on and we are in a very big frustration.\n\nMy advice is, think twice to work with this kind of fintech solutions. You don’t find any interlocutor when you need direct help. They should be aware of what troubles they cause in this kind of situations. Another strange thing is that they didn’t ask verification when you receive money into your account.
