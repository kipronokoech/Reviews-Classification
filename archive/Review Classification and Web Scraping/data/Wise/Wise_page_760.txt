First, they focus on one thing and do it very well. Second, the design and usability of the mobile app and desktop experience is very easy to understand. Third, the self-help provided answers 75% + of the questions I have, and when it doesn't getting an answer from a real person via email or chat is quick and knowledgable. Finally, I find communications to be transparent, straightforward and keeps me informed about changes in the service.
