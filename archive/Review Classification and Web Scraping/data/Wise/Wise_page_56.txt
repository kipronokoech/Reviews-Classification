Fast transfers are what we’re here for. But delays do happen for different reasons. It could be because the transfer was set up closer to the weekend/holidays, or because we needed to carry extra checks.

They took 43,000 HKD of my money, closed my account with no explanation and nobody at Wise is telling me when I will get my money back. When I email I either get no reply at all, or I get a reply that provides no information about if or when a refund might be made. When I call their phone helpline it typically takes 20 minutes for anyone to answer and then I get no useful information apart from being told that they understand my situation and that it has been passed to the relevant team. Meanwhile they are still holding my money and not returning it. I provided all the ID and all the banking details they asked for and still nothing. I don't even want my account reinstated (my Wise experience has been and continues to be truly, truly horrible) I just want my money back but they are not even doing this.", 'review_date': '2023-10-05', 'review_time': '03:36:57', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nOct 5, 2023\nHi Martin,\n\nAs a regulated financial institution, we'd never hold your money without a reason.\n\nDeactivating accounts isn't something we take lightly. It's often a result of a conflict with our Terms of Service or Customer Agreement, or due to a discrepancy with a financial law. We can't always share the exact reason for the deactivation, due to how we're regulated.\n\nIf you think we’ve made a mistake, you can follow these guidelines to appeal our decision: https://wi.se/accountdeactivation. We’ll review your request and get back to you ASAP via email. You'll also be able to add your refund details once you submit the appeal.\n\nWe'll work on sending the remaining money in your account back to you. But first, we need to carry out due diligence checks. While we do that, your money and information stays safe and secure.\n\nWise", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2023-10-05', 'CompanyReplyTime': '08:54:12'}
