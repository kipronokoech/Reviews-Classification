I was told that after i completely the first transaction the recipient would receive the money is 30 minutes...another lie. And its gets better.They charged my card, didnt provide the service and i could not get confirmation that the card had been refunded without contacting another department that they could or would not transfer me as i had to call them as well to get some answers.\n\nIf you want the poorest customer service known, go to Wise, you wont be disappointed.', 'review_date': '2022-04-29', 'review_time': '18:28:20', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
