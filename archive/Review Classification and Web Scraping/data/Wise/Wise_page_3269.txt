{'platform': 'Wise', 'id': '6093abe0f9f4870a786ff865', 'stars': 1, 'title': '"We\'re running some checks"', 'message': 'Works amazingly fast and convenient at first, but after passing a certain threshold in the total value and perhaps number of transfers, you will be presented with the infamous TransferWise trademark "We\'re running some checks" - AFTER you\'ve given them your money, without warning. So now, they\'ll keep your money hostage. While they say it will take 1-4 days, it seems to be common that it takes much longer than that. For me, it\'s been one week now. It doesn\'t matter if you send in your bank statements several days in advance. Customer service are friendly and quick, but it doesn\'t help when they seem to have no clue what\'s going on and you see zero progress for day after day past the original estimate. It\'s quite eerie, really, as you only get to know their first name (and it\'s a different person every time) but it might as well have been randomly generated, and it feels like they\'ve been trained to use their standard phrases like robots just to calm all the angry (and rightfully so!) people who feel betrayed. I doubt they\'re even located in the same country. What I\'ve been gathering is that they used to be legit, but when they dropped "Transfer" from their name, everything that they stood for went out the window. It\'s a nightmare, and the stress has been consuming us for a week now. I\'ll update this post whenever something happens, so that everyone gets a good understanding of how things proceed if you have a bit of bad luck.\n\nUpdate: Almost two weeks past the original estimate (and two weeks after sending the money), the checks were completed. However, the deadline for sending the money had been passed for over a week, so I cancelled it before the checks completion, and I got the money refunded and in my bank account the next day. All I know is that it may have been their banking partner or them doing these checks, they didn\'t even know, but basically, the lesson is to avoid Wise if possible, and absolutely not if you have a deadline and you can\'t afford being without the money that you send for three months (I even know one person who was a victim of that). After all, having the money withheld from you is costing you every day from not being able to have them invested!', 'review_date': '2021-05-14', 'review_time': '07:40:39', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nMay 18, 2021\nHello there,\n\nRest assured it is never our intention to delay payments, however as a regulated financial institution, we need to carry extra checks on transfers from time to time. We aim to complete this process as fast as possible, but it can take a bit longer than we've first expected.\n\nWhile we have a great customer support ready to get back to any questions you might have, we can't speed up payments from our side. If your transfer is pending checks, customer support can only advise you to await for updates.\n\nAll the best,\nWise Team.", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2021-05-18', 'CompanyReplyTime': '10:55:43'}
