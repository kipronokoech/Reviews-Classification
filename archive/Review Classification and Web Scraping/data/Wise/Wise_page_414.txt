I've been using it for three years now and haven't had any problems. I use accounts in different currencies and often use the option to withdraw money to my local bank account. Everything was always very fast and cheap. These are the cheapest commissions I have paid for this kind of payment. The only nuance and inconvenience that arose was the absence of a pin code on a bank card, thanks to this misunderstanding it is impossible to pay with a Wise card in my country, since terminals require a pin code, but it is not provided on the card. But this function is not critically important to me, so I put 5 points, I am very pleased with this service.", 'review_date': '2023-04-04', 'review_time': '20:46:21', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
