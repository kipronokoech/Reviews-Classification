However, without any warning, we had our account frozen or even withdrawn - I still don't know what is going on as it is very difficult to get a decent reply / get in contact. Very disappointing, as we are ourselves an IT company creating settlement platforms for third parties and were really enthusiastic about Wise. We thought we ought to have a fintech to service us, as we are a Fintech ourselves. The reason for Wise's actions was that we were accused of using the account for escrow services, which is not the case (in any shape or form, I'd might add). I think any auto-scanning against general conditions is giving some dubious results, which cannot be followed up manually for verification, as there is simply not enough staff. I feel that Wise is not yet an entirely reliable partner for business. As a small IT firm we are facing some real distress as we chose Wise and do not have any alternative means to make payments at present. To make things even more surreal. The holding company still has its account at Wise, so we have no way of challenging the decision to freeze the account of the subsidiary, as the money belongs to a company that also only has a Wise account and a Wise account cannot be used to start the appeals process. Shambles, really. It took me a while to decide to write a statement here, but I think I should warn other businesses. This fintech is not yet up to it, it seems. I hope that Wise will read this review and improve their scanning against the general conditions, follow-up, and customer services in general.

Had ATM issues with money not received, again, promptly solved.\n\nI have had challenges with my card. I previously had a MasterCard which I could use on my SamsungPay. After the aforementioned cloning, the NEW card is Visa and does not work.\nWise support made up some rubbish about my address being linked to card type - but basically, didn\'t care about my usability of the card.\n\nUntil now this was the most tedious issue.\n\nRecently I have had a number of challenges as a business customer - which although now solved, customers should be aware of.\n\nI admit to being concerned to write such a review given my other open accounts and fear of retaliation but frankly, the experience is so bad, I feel I need to write this for the benefit of others.\n\nIn the last few of months I have had an utterly frustrating experience with Wise.\nI must say it one of the worst encounters I have had with a financial institution in decades.\n\nIn late June, I applied for a business account (that is supposed to take 3-7 days to open), and it has been nothing short of a nightmare ever since.\n\nFirstly, the response time from Wise has been abysmal.\nFour business days later I receive a source of wealth information request, no explanation as to the trigger.\n\nI adhere to this totally reasonable request promptly no problem. AML and KYC regulation, I get it. I provide the information same day.\n\nFor over FIFTY days it then feels like I am banging my head against a wall.\n\nEmails go unanswered. I reply same day, I wait days and days for a response because they are clearly understaffed. I receive cookie-cutter copy/paste replies regularly.\nAstounding that a supposedly modern financial company would exhibit such indifference to their customers.\n\nOnce I was beyond 20 days of problems, I Cc\'d in multiple heads of customer service, and even the founder of Wise. Even THAT prompts ZERO change in my circumstances.\nNone of the senior people even bother to reply!\n\nWhat is more concerning is; when I raise a complaint about the process, I am told it will take a whopping THREE WEEKS to receive a response.\nIt actually takes far longer, I open the complain on 05/Jul, I receive a final response on 09/Aug! - THIRTY FIVE days.\nIn today\'s digital age, this is not only fantastical but demonstrates a complete lack of regard for customers\' time and needs. Especially a business customer.\n\nI faced daily financial penalties due to the delay in verifying my account, and Wise\'s inability to address this issue in a timely manner has caused significant disruption.\n\nBut the MOST shocking aspect of this whole tortuous process was Wise\'s security processes.\n\nThe privacy policy for Wise reads (and I quote)...\n\n"While our main processing centres are in the UK and the EU, we may transfer your data to and store it in countries outside of your jurisdiction, which do not offer an equivalent level of protection to your country. It may also be processed by staff operating outside of your jurisdiction."\n\nUpon reading that, I decided secured my source of wealth information (which is banking transactional information) with a password.\nThey know the password, and accessed the file, but the verification team refused to accept it because it was secured.\n\nInstead they irrationally insist on me sending my banking information, unsecured. Despite this being the SAME FILE, which they have seen the contents of.\n\nIt\'s both alarming and amazing that a BANK (of all companies) would take issue with a customers desire to secure their financial information.\nIt seems they prioritise their internal processes over customer data security, which is not only mind-boggling but entirely unacceptable.\n\nI fully understand and appreciate the importance of adhering to KYC and AML regulations and until now, I have found Wise to be a helpful banking partner. However, their lack of flexibility, and poor customer service is what has prompted this review.\n\nThroughout this entire experience, the customer service from Wise has been horrendous. They have insufficient representatives to reply promptly. When I call in, NUMEROUS agents agree with my position in principle, but infuriatingly, Wise\'s rigid robotic processes mean no-one seems able to change the situation.\n\nAfter Cc\'ing yet ANOTHER senior person, the Head of Customer Advocacy, I finally get a response from my THIRD "senior" customer support agent, Jillian.\nShe\'s great. Uses common sense, a reasoned approach, and FIFTY NINE days after I apply, my account goes active.\n\nAfter asking, I receive reasonable compensation but I can\'t get almost SIXTY days back and this review is well EARNED.\n\nConsider the above when it comes to your business accounts, especially if your business might prompt further verification requests.', 'review_date': '2023-09-09', 'review_time': '13:20:05', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nAug 10, 2023\nHello there,\n\nThanks for taking the time to explain the issues you are facing and giving us feedback.\n\nWe understand your concerns.

First we asked if this meant our account was being closed (no response), then I provided the information from who was available within 24hr (no response), then our transfers started getting cancelled and I asked again what was happening (no response), then our vendors started asking why our payments were late and we started to scramble to put them on the credit cards we could and use paypal.

They refuse to acknowledge that they are now slow as $h1t and I can only conclude that they are using our money without our knowledge or permission.\nWise used to ask if their estimate for the transfer time was accurate (and it was), now they just don't care.
