We understand how important it is to ensure timely payments to your contractors.\n\nWe checked our records, and it seems that we have been in contact with you via email. Our latest message was sent today, June 12. Please take a moment to review that email, and if you have any other questions let us know.\n\nWe never pause transfers without a reason, and usually, it's because we need to perform some verification. Verification is a vital step for us to maintain the security of our platform and your money. While we strive for speed, we also prioritize the safety of your funds. If there is a delay, it means we require a bit more time to verify the information you provided. Rest assured, updates are shared as soon as everything is completed from our side.\n\nIf you need immediate help, reach out to us here: https://wi.se/contactus_.

For those of us running a small business with transactions in several currencies, it is fantastic. Very smooth and effective and the user interface is well thought of. Producing whatever reports and evidence my accounts ask is very straightforward.\n\nEven if not a "traditional" bank, Wise still has to fulfil their obligations to the EU banking regulations. That means there will be questions about the nature of your business and about your banking. A bit annoying but unavoidable when banking in the EU, no matter which bank one deals with.\n\nThe only mild negative I find is the user interface for solving problems (or contacting the customer service team in general). I find all those pre-generated problems and solutions to them quite useless but eventually one gets to contact the team directly. It usually takes 2-3 days for the team to get back to you. Yet, each question I have had has been resolved completely.\n\nOverall, I am very happy with Wise and can recommend it to my fellow digital nomads and small business owners.', 'review_date': '2023-06-09', 'review_time': '09:04:50', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
