After all checks I have received the card and I could use it. During summer time I have received an email asking me to send payslips, occupation details, bank statements, annual revenue etc. I took it as a scam so didn’t respond. Being on holiday my account has been deactivated with all my money I paid into it without any explanation so I had no access to my different currencies and I had to borrow money from my personal account. Customer service doesn’t know anything and there’s not contact with decisive people who could explain anything. After appeal, deactivation was upheld and I was told (through email) they return the money (around £1k in different currencies) into account I have provided during appeal and this should take 2-5 days. It’s a month and nothing. I’m in process of reporting to Ombudsman and I was advised to report fraud to Police as well.\nKeep away from this scam but definitely don’t rely only on their card, as I did, when heading abroad.\n\nYeah, yeah, yeah… your reply is the same bulshit all the time. “We can’t do that, we can’t to this” but money to take and use them for a month without interest you can, right?! You pi**** me off so much that I won’t leave it as it is. There was no reason to cut me off from my money especially being on holiday unless the conflict with your terms and conditions is when I paid for hotels or in restaurants in Europe.
