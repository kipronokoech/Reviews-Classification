I rarely have any questions or problems but when I do they respond quickly. They are transparent about their service charges. They sometimes go up or down but they explain why. They seem to always be trying to innovate, for example in the beginning you couldn't set up drafts from your account but they added that. You can use ApplePay with your TransferWise account. The only suggestion for improvement I can think of at the moment is that you be able to choose which country in the euro zone your Transferwise account is based. At the moment there is no choice. But I give five stars because I think they are really trying their best to provide a good service.", 'review_date': '2020-11-01', 'review_time': '12:27:12', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

Read more at:https://transferwise.com/help/articles/2977986/how-do-i-change-my-spending-limits. Whereas the maximum limits are set, we do hope that in the future we're able to rise them.\n\nComing to our fees- our pricing is always as low as possible and we're constantly working on bringing down the fees whenever we can. While we might not be the cheapest on all of the routes out there, we're always transparent and offer the real mid market rate (just as seen on Google and Reuters).\nMore about our pricing at:https://transferwise.com/help/articles/2522717.\n\nIf any questions, don't hesitate to reach out at:https://transferwise.com/help/contact\n\nKind regards,\nTransferWise Team", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2020-11-04', 'CompanyReplyTime': '10:42:13'}
