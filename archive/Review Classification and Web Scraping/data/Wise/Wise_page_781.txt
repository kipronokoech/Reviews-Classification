Called ‚Äòcustomer service‚Äô to ask why contract of sale was rejected as verification to be told my full name isn‚Äôt on it. It‚Äôs the first thing on the document and sticks out like a sore thumb!!!!!! When I pointed this out, the customer service agent said it wasn‚Äôt an acceptable form of document. It‚Äôs what Wise suggest you send.\n\nMoney held in their account earning interest for them, no doubt waiting for the documents to be rejected a 3rd time.
