While we do that, you can always see an estimate of how long it’ll take to complete your transfer. Keep in mind this estimate can change depending on a few factors, such as the currencies you’re sending, when and how you are paying us. If we need more time, you’ll see the estimate update too.\n\nLearn more about that here: https://wi.se/howlongdotransferstake\n\nWise', 'CompanyReplyDate': '2023-08-28', 'CompanyReplyTime': '10:15:15'}

It contains the proceeds of a property sale. Wise asked for proof of income. I sent them the official documents of the sale. They said that wasn't enough, they needed bank statements. I sent them three months bank statements as requested. They said that wasn't good enough. I queried this with their support desk who said that six month statements were actually needed. So I sent six months statement. I got a message back two hours later saying my Wise account, which includes my business account was being closed down with no explanation. Presumably all down by a bot. I have appealed and been told it will take up to 30 days for them to review my case. Meanwhile I have wait for them to transfer all the funds in my account. Absolutely appalling service. We no longer have any rights as customers. I can't even call them as that number is revered for account holders.

You can still use Wise\'s transfer rates without the multi-currency account.\n\nI used my account regularly for a while already, until they decided block it, asking me to "verify my income" to regain access to it. And verifying my income I did, just that they actually wanted a lot more when they saw that I, on my personal bank account (NOT the wise account!), received payments by another person - they wanted me to upload tax documents of that person, which is a clear violation of basic data pricacy. This alone is quite ridiculous, but the main problem is that they kept denying access to my money. It took over 7 months, many useless phone calls, ignored emails, unanswered letters, and almost a lawsuit until they simply closed my account and sent me back my remaining money from the multi-currency account. Their support sometimes doesnt answer for over two months. This is clearly not OK and is far beyond any regular fault tolerance, considering the amount of money. I am using many different banks and I never had to fight for the company to not ignore my support requests.
