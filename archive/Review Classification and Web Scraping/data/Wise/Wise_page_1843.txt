They use the "verification" as an excuse when the transfer rate does not go their way.\n\nUPDATE 09/05/2022\nSo, finally after calling customer service again and threatening to complain to the FCA, Wise has refunded back my funds. However, the exchange rates have changed and I am out of pocket by 35 pounds !! Lousy service from a terrible company.\n\nUPDATE 04/11/2022\nDay 18 and still no transfer. Apparently the staff are really busy !!\n\nUPDATE 29/04/2022\nSo, it\'s day 13 and Wise has still not performed the transfer. No indication of why or how long it will take.\n\n--------------------------------\nI\'ve used wise (Transferwise) a number of times over the last seven years. By and large they are efficient and quick. However, when things go wrong they really go wrong !! Customer service is non-existent. You get a canned response that the transfer is taking longer than usual.

Wise handled the house transfer after a few questions and additional documentation, but the the second one was delayed, after a period of four days during which Wise continued to indicate that the transfer would be completed by the fourth day. At that point, Wise reverted to a message that indicated delay, but without any reason or estimate as to when the transfer would be completed. Days passed with no movement or change. Chats with customer service were fruitless, as agents could only repeat canned phrases such as ‚Äúdon't worry, we're working on it,‚Äù etc., without any specific information. We were forced to delay the closing on the house several times as a result. After ten days, we finally gave up on Wise and initiated a transfer through my bank, since the money for the transfer was still in my account (in other words, Wise hadn't even withdrawn the money after all this time). At any rate, we are finished with Wise; I'm sure they are competent for a lot of transactions, but if you have any sort of deadline, I'd think twice before using them.", 'review_date': '2022-04-26', 'review_time': '08:41:25', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
