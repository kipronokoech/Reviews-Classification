This isn't something we take lightly. It's normally a result of a conflict with our Terms of Service or Customer Agreement, or due to a discrepancy with a financial law. We can't share the exact reason of the deactivation, due to how we're regulated. However, you can find some possible reasons here wi.se/accountdeactivation.\n\nIf you're not happy with this decision, you can appeal here https://wi.se/-appeal, and our appeals team will reach out to you once they have further updates regarding your account.\n\nAs for your remaining money in your account, we'll work on sending it back to you. But first, we need to carry out due diligence checks. While we do that, your money and information will be safe and secure.\n\nWise", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2022-11-14', 'CompanyReplyTime': '10:38:53'}

Wise has blocked this transfer as they wanted more info about the sender, which is me. After providing them with the details I waited, and when I saw that the transfer is not being released I called them and they said it can take between 1 to 4 business days! That is insane, I had to pay my supplier urgently today. I have a container waiting in Hamburg and I need to pay VAT for it asap to have it released, and Wise is holding my money.\nThey claim that it is due to some sanctions, but this has never happened to me with Barclays. And besides, both the sender and the receiver is me.\nThis is now affecting my business as I don't have any money to pay for the VAT, and the container will incur demurrage costs if I don't pay in time.\nDo not bank with these guys. Stick to a regular bank for business, they're an utter joke.\nPlus, paying with the Wise card online is a nightmare. They will ask you to confirm transactions for security, and those transactions go back years.

However, while our goal is to complete all payments as fast as we can, we’re a regulated financial institution and as such, we need to carry extra checks on transfers from time to time. This doesn't mean that something is wrong with your transfer, it's just a routine process to confirm who is sending/receiving money and why. This is to ensure that Wise is safe and secure for everyone on it.\nAs processing these checks is a legal requirement and therefore cannot be avoided, we have the following section in our Customer Agreement agreed by you upon opening of your Wise account: https://wise.com/terms-of-use\n\n“Verification checks may increase the time for processing your transfer order. We carry out verification checks, and these checks may increase the time it takes to process your transfer order. We cannot be responsible for any delays as a result of carrying out those checks.”\n\nSpeed is always our priority, but so is diligence. Depending on the case, it can take from hours to several days. Do keep in mind, we always make sure to update you along the way, and you’ll know the status of your transfer at all times.\n\nAs for the Wise card, security has and will always be our top security to make sure our platform is safe for everyone using, including you.\n\nWise", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2022-11-14', 'CompanyReplyTime': '10:56:04'}

We mark your transfer “Complete” when we’ve sent the money to the receiving bank. No need to worry, if it's not there immediately.\nSome banks are just slower than others — they might take up to a few working days for them to release the money, especially when we've sent it on a weekend. So your money’s safely on its way, but the bank is still processing it. You can ask the bank to speed this up. You’ll need a transfer receipt that has all the details. Here's how to download it: https://wi.se/getpdfreceipt\n\nHope this helps and if you need more assistance, please reach us at https://wi.se/contactus_ or on our social media channels.\n\nWise", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2022-11-14', 'CompanyReplyTime': '11:09:49'}
