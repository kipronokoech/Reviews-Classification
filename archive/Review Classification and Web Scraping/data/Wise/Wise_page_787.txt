I'm working with an American company as a contractor software developer. This February I had to flee Russia and seek asylum in Finland. Wise made it possible for me to get paid while I was in Finland and later in Czech Republic. Specifically the ease of getting a debit card was amazing. First off, I didn't have to wait for the physical card to arrive because right after you order one, you can add it to apple pay (insert other on-device payment method here) and better yet, I've done it with a digital card you can make at the same moment for an additional layer of security. That enabled me to utilize my salary. Furthermore changing the billing address, which I had to do 3 times over the course of 6 months, is supremely easy. I could go on, but I think this is the most important part.", 'review_date': '2022-11-10', 'review_time': '12:10:53', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
