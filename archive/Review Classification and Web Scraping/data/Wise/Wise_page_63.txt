I do not know why I cannot get the 2 step verification for Wise on my phone, as I can and have gotten those codes for all kinds of credit cards, banks, services, etc. I am in Croatia - not the moon. The Wise app says oh, if you can\'t get the code, use your password. Did. It laughed at me, saying "Error while triggering SMS for user". My phone and number are American so I use +1 at the beginning of my phone number. I tried Croatia\'s +385 and same error message. I got a Croatia SIM in case that would help: nope, same message no matter what I do. SOME reputable companies have ways to help in this kind of issue, and/or allow email and security questions to get me access to my own money. WISE does none of this. And I can get no response from customer service.', 'review_date': '2023-10-01', 'review_time': '11:19:24', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
