Ir oder to do so I transferred almost 15,000 € to Wise in Belgium, and then the nightmare started.\n\nIt\'s been a whole three weeks (three weeks!) asking for my money, with messages from Wise assuring that the sum had been paid when in fact it had not, more messages telling me that I would receive emails with all the details (which I didn\'t receive), messages asking absurd details (my profession, my employer, my daughter\'s personal data...what does all this have to do with a money transfer???), and receiving no answer when I asked some details on their side in order to track the transaction on the recipient\'s bank.\n\nIt seems that I had to put in touch with the Complaints Team in order to obtain a prompt answer (thanks to the Finance Ombudsman in Brussels for providing the email address). And the Wise\'s answer states that "we mistakenly sent your case to another team and the ticket was closed". Three weeks for that, with a series of messages and chats asking what was going on???\n\nWise added a compensation, a 5,000 GBP fee-free transfer, that may seem a nice detail, but I seldom transfer a sum in excess of 3,000, so this is not of much help or really useable.\n\nIn the past everything has worked like charm with Wise, all the transactions were performed on the spot with little to no hassle, but the last one caused us a lot of trouble with a third party (fortunately a patient one that could wait three weeks for a large sum) and, therefore, I cannot give a good rating.\n\n05/06 add-on\nLast week I received two e-mails from Wise, asking again the personal data of my daughter, and threatening with closing my account. I answered that, according to Spanish law, you cannot provide personal data of anybody without his/her written consent, but to no avail: they have made a summary, explanation and conclusion document (judge and part, when the reality is that the mistake was theirs, not mine) with the same results: they want personal data of a third person and they threat with closing the account.
