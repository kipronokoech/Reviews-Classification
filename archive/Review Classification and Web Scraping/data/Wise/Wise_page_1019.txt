This was one of the worst experience I had amongst all the services I use. And they do not respond at all to e-mails and phone calls unless 3 days before contacting them.\nThe problem is they are very slow in replying and considering this is financial services thier replies are very inaccurate . I was told to contact the Japan Wise contact number and have been trying to contact for 4 days continously and multiple times, but there is no Answer. Here is the proof ...this is just those for which I could take screenshots. I have tried through various methods but there is no answer on that number and my account remains de-activated and I loose money everyday. You see how many times I have called in the screenshot below , and despite having told this to your client support through e-mails various times , they still ask me to keep trying this number. After I have withdrawn my funds ...I will NEVER again use thier service...and I will NEVER refer/reccomend anyone to Wise ...\n\nAs there is no way to reply to Wise reply, I have to edit my post for this part ..the above part remains unchaged. Wise in thier reply have mentioned to write a mail. I have proof of almost 10 unreplied mails and 20 unanswered calls. Infact I am quite surprised that Wise had time to reply to my post here but not respond to almost 10 of my mails I have followed up in the past two days!!\n\nAfter my previous post my problem still remains resolved as of October 3rd. No one answers on thier phone and niether have they called me . I have lost money due to the exchange rate because of Wise's no response.", 'review_date': '2022-10-03', 'review_time': '02:49:53', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nSep 28, 2022\nHello,\n\nWe understand having your account closed is frustrating, but rest assured this is never done without a reason.

Unfortunately, markets have been more volatile recently, which makes it more expensive for us to buy and sell currencies — so we need to raise our fees to cover those costs.\n\nBut we're actively working on lowering our fees, and hopefully, this will happen on your currency route as well soon.\n\nWe continue to sustainably invest in our infrastructure, so you can move money faster and more conveniently.
