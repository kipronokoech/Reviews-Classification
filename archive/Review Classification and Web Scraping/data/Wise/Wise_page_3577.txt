Also, we always keep you updated about your transfer from "activity" tab on your app/account, and customer support will have access to the same information.\n\nHowever, if you\'d like to speak to agents, our contact information it\'s available from the app and from the web site as well.\n\nAll the best,\nJackeline at TransferWise.', 'CompanyReplyDate': '2021-01-22', 'CompanyReplyTime': '12:00:07'}
