Wise is no different. Weâ€™re a regulated financial institution, and verification is how we keep your money safe, and comply with the financial regulations in the countries we operate in. We do our best to complete verification as soon as possible.\n\nWe sometimes need to renew our verification to make sure we know who is using our service and how. It doesn't mean that something is wrong with your account it's just a routine procedure.\n\nHowever, without it, you can't use our account, since it's mandatory. By now mean we don't mean it as a threat, but as a notice.\n\nThanks for bearing with us.\n\nWise", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2023-05-29', 'CompanyReplyTime': '13:07:15'}

{'platform': 'Wise', 'id': '6464fd9f87d222ec23081dec', 'stars': 1, 'title': 'Wise is badly managed, not well controlled', 'message': 'I must add to the chorus of people screaming that Wise is managed badly and provides very low standard "customer support " - it is not support when it is so hard to speak to someone, (they conceal their telephone number although it is actually available by a simple google search or other users who got it when it was still available on the app); even after you finally speak to someone (having gone through multiple pointless repeated "menus" trying to fob you off with irrelevant options) - you wait forever until you get to someone who may or may not know what they are talking about. In addition WISE seem to make up reasons to be secretive - for example, you receive (an anonymous email) demanding you to provide information for verification, but they refused to say WHO/WHICH DEPT and WHY this info is provided. But I am supposed to believe that an email coming from "noreply@wise" is a legitimate one! In the era of so much hacking, shouldn\'t they at least provide credible answers rather than seem to have no clue this email arrived? and is it even legal to withhold such information?\nTransferwise was better before, and Wise was good initially, but I have lost confidence with recent inept, tardy email exchanges with wrong information provided non-challantly, so I am looking into a good alternative. I am sorry because I was ready to recommend WISE for the good things, these they do well, but the bad things are serious. The best rates are good only if you can go on about your business well.\n\nI need a financial platform I can rely on a lot more than I feel I can rely on WISE: this means not only good rates, which is a factor but plays a lesser role to that of good reliable customer support! WISE please remember that your customers can\'t even see you, you have no face, no branches in our towns, you only exist on our apps websites and emails! We need even more the reassurance that you are a reliable platform, which functions well and has high standard customer support with well connected departments and informed, trained staff.
