I tried repeatedly to send more than that amount resulting in many cancelled transactions. It wasn't until failing over and over did I call and found out about the daily limit. The customer service was excellent but it could have been avoided if the instructions were clearer about the daily limit, which at the time was $20K.\nI used to get emails alerting me that my money was received by the recipient but lately I do not.
