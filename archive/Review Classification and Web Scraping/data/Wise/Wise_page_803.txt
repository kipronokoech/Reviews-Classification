Low fees has historically been one of their selling points, but they are starting to subtlety raise them lately.\n\nWeb & Mobile UX/UI is good, clean, and modern, but some flows are not entirely smooth or intuitive (e.g., hide a failed transaction from the least, to give a silly example).\n\nControl and security measures they implement for users (e.g., daily/transaction amount limits, etc.) are not transparent, so you never know ahead of time whether your transfer will go thru in seconds or if they will hold it for four days for extra verification.\nHence, you end up canceling many incomplete transactions.", 'review_date': '2022-11-06', 'review_time': '17:08:42', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
