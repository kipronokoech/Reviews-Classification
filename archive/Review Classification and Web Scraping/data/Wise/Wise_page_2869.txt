I found it to be really efficient and easy to use. It is very convenient to hold multiple currencies and use them for purchases made from abroad. One of the most popular companies used for internet purchases gives bad exchange rates and so Wise comes in very handy. It is very useful when travelling as you don't have to worry about bad exchange rates. The card and account handling is very easy. Transferring money to family abroad is invaluable and efficient. My only gripe is that I wish that I could transfer from my bank account to Wise without notifying on the app how much I am transferring. All in all, I highly recommend Wise.", 'review_date': '2021-08-28', 'review_time': '22:50:31', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
