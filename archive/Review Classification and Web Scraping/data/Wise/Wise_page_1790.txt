Everything went smoothly until I got a message that my transaction was paused because my name on my bank listed my wife as owner and me listed second as co-owner. I was asked to send copies of photos of my bank statement and a check which I did. Then I got a message that my transaction was still paused and I needed to contact my bank and make a wire transfer of $2000 since the euros had already been sent but Wise was unable to get my funds from my US bank. I verified that the euros had indeed been deposited in my Italian account, so I went to my bank and wired $2000. After returning home, I discovered that Wise successfully completed the debit from my bank for $2000 I addition to the wire transfer that I sent for $2000. So now instead sending 2000, I have sent $4000 to convert to Euros to my Italian account. I never asked for or initiated a second transaction. What a hassle. I will continue to use Wise as it is the best method I‚Äôve found to convert and transfer funds to my account in Italy. I have not requested that the second transaction be reversed as I was planning on sending additional cash over in the summer and the exchange rate right now is very good.', 'review_date': '2022-05-05', 'review_time': '19:41:05', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
