Company has no managers of call centre teams and can apparently keep your money for 3-10 days until the 'team' mentioned above has completed undisclosed 'checks'.

Wise accepted the GBP and exchanged to EUR for a low fee. I'm glad I took a screenshot of the account balance during the document verification process, as I can not access my account and there is no record of the held amount on email. I'm advised by Wise of 24 business days for a appeal to be processed, but I now read of other cases extending over 70 days - very concerning.\nRight now the EUR balance, which is just over 3000€, is effectively stolen from me whilst I wait for an ambiguous time period for an appeal to be processed.\n\nI'm a freelancer. I was required of Wise to verify my primary source of income. I don't have a sign service agreement, as that form of self-employment is illegal here in Germany (German gov. requires you to me full-time employed).\nWise would not accept 4yo tax return (2019) despite 2020 and 2021 being delayed with my accountants (most countries allow financial records up to 5 years).\n\nWise also claimed that an interim balance sheet for 2021, which was earlier prepared and stamped by my accountant was also too old. This document was prepared for a round of covid business relief funding that the German government accepted, but Wise did not accept?!?\n\nThe latest request for verification of primary source of income was to present invoices and bank statements for the current year (2023), to which I notified it would take some time to collate as I needed to bring my book keeping up-to-date.\n\nWhilst preparing the requested tranche of documents, the paused transfer to my bank account was cancelled.\n\nWhen finally I prepared the tranche of documents, I had over 40 documents to upload. Their upload system is limited to pdf and image files, and unable to accept compressed folders (such as *.zip). 40 documents seemed too many for their upload system to handle. I was able to attached some documents.\n\nMy account was cancelled whilst awaiting for a reply and the opportunity to upload the remainder of the requested documents,\n\nI filed an appeal and attempted to attach the whole tranche of requested documents, but this too failed..\nI was able to attach a pdf note stating that I had more documents to attach.\n\nI was able to get someone on the phone (international call rate for 18 minutes - which is going to hurt €€) whom sent an email to me, which I was able reply and attach compressed folders containing the tranche of requested documents. During the telephone call, my case was escalated, but no reference number or similar details were offered as receipt of escalation.\n\nWhilst the amount is relatively small, it's still 2.5 months of operating expenses whilst my business is still slumped post Covid. I don't know how I'm going to pay my rent whilst I wait 24 business days for an appeal to be processed. I now read on various sources the Wise takes beyond that time frame to respond to the appeal.\n\nIn general, each response from Wise seemed to be disconnected from the previous email or telephone contact. I am extremely annoyed that my account was cancelled in the midst of a document request from Wise. Very unprofessional.\n\nI have since filed a case with an ombudsman in the EU, as per the details listed on Wise website. I've also read it's helpful to complain on socials daily, so here goes!\n\nPlus I do want to warn people of the risks of running funds through this company, especially if you are a freelancer like me that deals in payments in multiple currencies!", 'review_date': '2023-07-14', 'review_time': '07:41:41', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
