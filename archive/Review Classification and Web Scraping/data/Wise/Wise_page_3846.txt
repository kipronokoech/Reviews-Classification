Rest assured, we're none the less constantly working to improve speeds, even on routes that might not be the fastest at the moment.\n\nWe're able to send payments to mobile wallets with some currencies, such as sending KES to MPesa. For more specifics, feel free to get in touch with our support here: https://wi.se/contactus or over our social media channels (Twitter, Facebook). Our agents will be happy to advise on any routes you're interested in :)\n\nBest wishes,\nTransferWise Team", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2020-11-12', 'CompanyReplyTime': '14:04:49'}
