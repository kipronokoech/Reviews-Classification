I have checked other competitor websites for rates and Wise still beats them.

No regular bank will pause your account and disable your banking facility while they re-KYC you. Only if you've gone over the stated time limit.

Indeed, we're not like a regular bank, but we're regulated like one.\n\nPlease mind that any regulated financial institution has the right to carry out compliance related checks in order to confirm who is sending/receiving money and why. This is to ensure that Wise is safe and secure for everyone on it.\nAs processing these checks is a legal requirement and therefore cannot be avoided, we have the following section in our Customer Agreement agreed by you upon opening of your Wise account: https://wise.com/terms-of-use\n\n‚ÄúVerification checks may increase the time for processing your transfer order. We carry out verification checks, and these checks may increase the time it takes to process your transfer order. We cannot be responsible for any delays as a result of carrying out those checks.‚Äù\n\nAs soon as we have any updates, we'll reach out to you right away via email.\n\nWise.", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2022-12-20', 'CompanyReplyTime': '14:06:54'}
