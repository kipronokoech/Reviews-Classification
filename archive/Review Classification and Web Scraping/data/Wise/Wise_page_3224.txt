I was a scared to try it at first, but now I am so thankful that I did! I am a U.S. citizen who was living in Germany, where most payments (other than shopping and dining) are done via bank transfer. When I first arrived, I was able to pay rent and other bills in euros from my US bank account knowing I was getting the best possible rate. I knew this because I had done a cost comparison with another very popular virtual payment method (which starts with a P but shall remain nameless) that is used frequently for domestic purchases and sometimes money transfers in the U.S. That particular payment method would have cost significantly more for me to transfer the same amount of money for rent. Wise was also helpful for transfers in the other direction. Once I got set up with a German bank account, I could easily transfer euros into dollars to deposit directly into my U.S. bank account as needed. This was especially the case since I opted for N26 bank, which partners with Wise to make international transfers super streamlined. If you need to do foreign/international bank transfers with any regularity, I highly recommend Wise! Just be sure to allow a few days for the transfer to go through if you want to save the most money.', 'review_date': '2021-05-17', 'review_time': '23:24:15', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
