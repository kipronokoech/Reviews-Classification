Last week I was initially attracted by the currency rate provided by Wise in comparison with my own bank. It claims the exchange rate is guaranteed for 3 days if I transferred within the period. Then I made the transfer to Wise provided bank account. However, my money was stucked there and online claims "it\'s awaiting my transfer" for hours. I uploaded transfer receipt then but nobody response on it for a day and then I called customer support. They then took more than a day or so to manually transfer the money. However, the guarantee period of exchange rate was gone and I finally get a really bad exchange rate that caused a substantial loss. I filed a complaint to their support but so far no one reply me for a week already. Therefore, if you are attracted by the exchange rate, you may need to take the risk Wise hold your money with a result of random exchange rate provided by Wise later on. There is no so called guaranteed exchange rate as long as they can hold your fund.\n\nUpdate: The reply from Wise in this post below is not following up how to improve their bad service and instead they claim the fund is not arrived on time and it\'s responsibility from the customer. However:\n\n1) The fund had been arrived at the same day. I did a transfer before that it takes less than 1 minute to arrive Wise account. I uploaded my receipt and showing the date I transferred my fund.\n\n2) Wise finally need to link up my fund manually - it means the fund arrived already but required their internal and manually intervention - it\'s their end problem and not my problem\n\n3) When I ask them anything I did it wrong at my side and probably lead to delay? There is no feedback from them. In this case, I can only assume Wise will hold my fund due to whatever reason.\n\n4) When I ask them will they reimburse my loss due to new exchange rate used. Again, no reply, no feedback from them so far', 'review_date': '2021-06-30', 'review_time': '10:24:58', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nJun 30, 2021\nHello, Synru.\n\nWe guarantee the rate as long as we receive your payment within a certain time frame.
