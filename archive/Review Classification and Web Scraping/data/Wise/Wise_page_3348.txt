When they were still called TRANSFERWISE, everything was perfect. I had to call them twice in the registration phase, and they went on the phone immediately. Though I write this text in English, actually I live in Germany, and my call was just a local phone number, and answered in German. People on the phone knew exactly what to do. No students or a fake help desk people that don\'t help you at all. It WAS perfect. But since the name change, all of that seems gone.\n\nThis week, I received a payment of 2141 Euro from the USA. The sender showed me his screen shot, that he was charged 7$ by wise, and 2141 Euro was send to my acount.\n\nInstead of that, they picked 64 Euro "fees" from the payment and only send me 2077. This is really disgusting, and totally not in line with what they showed on their website.\n\nI have to say it: We were simply fooled by them.\n\nHere comes the next problem. So yes, we need to talk about this with them.\n\nPhone number.... GONE! There have no phone number any more.\n\nEmail adress.... GONE!\n\nNow, hiding your contact data, is a serious offense for EUROPEAN companies. They are located in Belgium they write. A company must show phone number and real email, so xxx(at)yyy.com with a maximum of two clicks from the homepage, and easy to see and find. THEY DO NOT DO SO AT WISE.\n\nHere comes the next problem:\n\nThe incoming payment (minus 61 Euro "fees") arrived at my bank, but does NOT SHOW UP at the WISE website. So how can we talk about their errors, if they hide the payment on their website?????\n\nAfter a lot of trying, I finally found a "how can we help you" page hidden under my personal settings. What a crazy place!!!!!!\n\nBut still no way to call them.\n\nI can only write my problem in an email, or apply for a chat. So I applied for a chat. When I do, I need to click for which transaction the chat is going to be. But the transaction is not shown! So I have to click something else is the problem, and at least that brings me into "apply for a chat option". Only when I do so, it jumps back to the beginning, with "how can we help you" So an endless circle.\n\nWhat a disgusting situation!\n\nThe USA person who send the money is also totally upset about it, and tried to call them locally. He was put in a waiting line for one hour and he stopped trying.\n\nSo in the end, I was fooled with 61 Euro fees, and no way to contact them.\n\nAt least we can be glad, 97% of the payment still arrived.\n\nI WILL NEVER USE THEM AGAIN.', 'review_date': '2021-04-09', 'review_time': '09:06:57', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
