Rarely, the funds might be returned to us by the recipient party for several reasons. If this happens, we send out the funds again one more time. Should it happen for the second time, we typically need to cancel the transfer. Usually, when there is an update, we email you with the details. So, it's always best to keep an eye on your email inbox, as we also reach out if we need any additional information from your end to complete the transfer.\n\nWe understand that this might be frustrating. However, we always work on communicating with you in each step to notify you about the transaction.\n\nIt seems like we're in touch via emails, and our support team is doing their best to assist you as effectively as possible. That said, we appreciate you taking the time to share your experience with us. Your feedback is important for us to grow.\n\nWise", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2023-10-26', 'CompanyReplyTime': '13:25:29'}
