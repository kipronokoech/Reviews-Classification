Wise guaranteed our rate provided we provided documents in time. We did this. I got an email 2.5 days later saying my transfer had been cancelled due to a system error on their part and to redo it. My partner got a similar email (though his didn't mention that it was Wise's fault). We were both left at the mercy of the new, lower rate. This lost us over $1000.\nWise's initial response was that it would be resolved immediately and we would be compensated. Luckily we didn't wait, because 4 days later we have been told they need to check whose fault it is. We know its theirs because they have all our documents and when we did the new transfer they used those and sent it through correctly.\nWe chose Wise because they're trusted. We won't use them again, they're unreliable and don't try to resolve things when they've messed up. Very bad customer service!\n\nEDITED FOLLOWING WISE’S RESPONSE BELOW\nWise do have my account and transaction details so I’m not sure why they’re saying they don’t. Another example of their incompetence. They did conduct an investigation eventually but didn’t give me the promised compensation despite admitting there was a bug in their system that affected not just us but lots of people.
