When we close an account with money on it, we need to carry due diligence checks first. Once these checks are completed, we always get in touch about the refund.\n\nDue diligence checks are conducted to verify the information you have provided to us. We are required to do these at all stages of the customer relationship, not just during the initial onboarding stage, so this means during the customer relationship as well as during the deactivation stage.\n\nIt shouldn't take more than 20 working days, but as soon as our team has any news, they'll reach out.\n\nWise.", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2023-01-11', 'CompanyReplyTime': '12:56:32'}
