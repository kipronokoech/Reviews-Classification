I decided against carrying loads of money as I originally planned on this card. And I am so grateful for reading the reviews on consumeraffairs.com. I have to say that as long as it was straight forward, I had no problem receiving an answer to every question via email. As soon as there began a problem, they have stopped communicating and pretend like they don't understand what the issue is.\n\nMy card got hacked at the atm and I was fraudulently charged over 500 dollars. Have been communicating over this with them over weeks but it doesn't seem to go forward.\n\nAlso please see bad reviews on this site for this company named as transferTwise. Same name but cleverly disguised. Do read wise reviews on consumeraffairs.com\n\nI will be updating my experience to let you know on this website as time goes to see if they do anything about it or not.\n\nOk this is an update. Wise did reverse my charges and promised to send a new physical card at my address. It was to be received last month. However till this day I haven't received it. And I have been following up with emails on this but there is no answer from them. Previously they were contacting me back in time but not now. Seems like they probably blocked me or something. I need to travel next month and need to load some money but I don't have the physical card yet. Let's see what happens.

They deal with volume and create SOPs which make them way less human than an actual bank agent who can understand that a single bank transfer isn't making you a criminal.\nI don't recommend banking with them.
