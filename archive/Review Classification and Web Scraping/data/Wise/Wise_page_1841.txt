The card has been hugely helpful for our daughter as she is a student in Europe and I can preload the card with money for her.

Although Wise does have fees, they are very reasonable compared to other credit cards, and their exchange rates are usually much better than others.', 'review_date': '2022-04-27', 'review_time': '05:14:04', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
