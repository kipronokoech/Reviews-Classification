This means that if an ATM fails, or communication fails, or anything else in the process, commissions will systematically be charged when the transaction occurs conveniently.\n- Charging a commission when the maximum of 2 had not even been exceeded, considering that the first one, which was never made, exceeded the amount.\n\nI am very satisfied with Wise in general, but I find these types of incidents a bit embarrassing and wonder, if this is just a few cents commission, what would happen with a bigger issue.', 'review_date': '2023-09-09', 'review_time': '18:21:30', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

When it does, you'll also be able to see it in your activity list.\n\nWe try to move your money as fast as possible, but how long it takes to receive money into your balance depends on the transfer method and currency you're receiving. Read more about it here: https://wi.se/howlongpaymentsbalance\n\nIf it's been longer than the estimated timeframe, first check with the sender whether they used the correct account details. If they did, send us a proof of payment, so we can check it. You can find more details about what you have to do at the end of the webpage, we shared above.\n\nShould you have other questions, please reach out to us at: https://wi.se/contactus, or on Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram with your email and user number.
