I visited the link so helpfully supplied by transferwise in their response to my last review and had a chat with one of their reps. I was told that even though we\'re now at 8 days and counting it would take "a bit more time". When I asked if there was a manager I could speak with, I was told they don\'t have managers. So apparently everyone there is at the exact same level and no one has any greater authority. Very interesting. Clearly that seems to be working well at making things run smoothly for their customers. If I could rate this service at less than one star I would.', 'review_date': '2020-11-04', 'review_time': '14:56:51', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nNov 6, 2020\nHi Kirsten.\nWe're sorry to hear your feedback to us.\n\nOur customer support is well trained and equally able to advise on all kind of questions.

However, keep in mind that after the transfer has been completed from our side- there's also a delivery time that varies for each currency. You can always check the currency moving speeds here:https://transferwise.com/help/articles/2571907.\n\nBesides that, keep in mind that financial institutions might carry out regular bank checks from time to time, which could be what is happening. Feel free to click on the transfer and download the transfer confirmation PDF, which has all the details for the recipient that their bank would need. This should help them locate the funds, but we're here if any questions.\n\nFind our details listed at:https://transferwise.com/help/contact.\n\nBest wishes,\nTransferWise Team.", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2020-11-05', 'CompanyReplyTime': '12:18:04'}
