Verification is unreliable and landed me in a foreign country with no access to my card because they wanted another document that they did not tell me they needed (and indeed told me they had everything they needed). First gripe. Second is that UK payments are completely unreliable. They advertise once they have the money, and converted it to GBP it will transfer quickly (using faster payments within a few hours). Try a few days and now one has gone missing. I transfer a few times a month, and 90% take 2 days - not 2 hours as advertised, the problem is that Wise swear blind they sent it, and recipient banks swears blind they did not, and no one will sort it out. As I only have trouble transferring with Wise - its them who have the issue.\nIf only there was an alternative, I would be gone in seconds now they are so bad.\nThe card is the only part that is good now - until they block it.', 'review_date': '2023-03-01', 'review_time': '13:29:06', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

After the payment was made, a message appeared on the website that the payment would be received by the recipient in 47 minutes. 30 minutes after this message, a new message came to the e-mail that the money would arrive no earlier than 4 days later.
