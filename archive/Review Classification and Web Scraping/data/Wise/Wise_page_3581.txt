TW some months back decided to change banks without notification. Within a few weeks of my previous transfer I get a warning after I had executed a transfer into my account that they had changed banks. It got it sorted within a week but they're not the best in terms of letting customers know of changes.\n\nI set up a business account in late 2019. What a lot of drama that was. What irks me the most is to get verified you have to tell them what products you deal in. Why the hell does that matter. Because I was delving into online retailing using a dropship model there is no definitive product line. Mousetraps one day silk scarves the next sort of thing. Covid put the stops on that business venture so no TX's since starting the account. Now early 2021 I get a verification request (what products are you selling) when its pretty obvious (no account activity) I'm not selling anything. So they automatically suspend your personal and business account without notice to reverify you. They're not the sharpest knife in the drawer!!! Why would you suspend a customer's account to ask a stupid question when any halfwit could look and see the answer.\n\nI think we're into 5 days (supposed to be only one) and several emails and my personal account is still frozen.
