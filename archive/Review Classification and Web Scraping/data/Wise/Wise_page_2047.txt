Wise is no different. We’re a regulated financial institution, and verification is how we keep your money safe, and comply with the financial regulations in the countries we operate in. We do our best to complete verification as soon as possible, and it’s usually done within 2 - 4 working days. In rare cases, it might take longer if we need additional information, but we’ll always let you know if that’s the case.\n\nWise', 'CompanyReplyDate': '2022-04-19', 'CompanyReplyTime': '12:41:17'}

After years of making the same amount, every month-transfer, they suddenly start asking a great number of "very" personal questions, such as where did you work, what sector, country, income "with income proof", etc, etc.\nWhen I asked, why this new behaviour, their only answer were "to keep my money safe" ....????? How is my money more safe when they know every detail of my private life?\nAs there were no possible arguing or better explanation I immediately closed my accounts at Wise.\nI don\'t give my private data for making a "small" transfer and especially not if you cannot give a rational/logical explanation.\nThey have already copy of my ID and can see I am not a Russian mogul, so what is the point?\n20.04.22 Answer from Wise: only meaningless blabla. First: I made transfers every month since over 5 years and in average < 2.500.-€. There was never such a request for such private information. Second: The money got transferred from my official EU account to my official account abroad. What is suspicious in that?\nThis answer is the same standard "robot" answer you get from their customer service: It doesn\'t mean anything, just hide behind bureaucratic regulations, which I not even undermined or acted against it. So keep your stupid answers for those who didn\'t find out yet that their initial home bank has the same advantages for transfers without the privacy violations.', 'review_date': '2022-04-20', 'review_time': '02:18:47', 'CompanyReply': 'Reply from Wise\nApr 19, 2022\nHello Gustave,\n\nPlease mind that any regulated financial institution has the right to carry out compliance related checks in order to confirm who is sending/receiving money and why.
