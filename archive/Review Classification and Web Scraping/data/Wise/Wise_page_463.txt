Their system is filled with lies and all types of issues to block you from actually using it. They are incredibly incompetent and consistently block you from using your own money for days and weeks. You cannot use this card when traveling, it is not made for you to travel, because they will put you on horrible situations all the time, and especially when you need an urgent transfer. I have this all connected directly to my credit card and my bank account. Nothing works because they blocked me. They say they have to confirm transfers and takes them a week to do so. How incompetent is this?!!! It's horrible! These people are stupid and useless and unprofessional beyond belief. This is not a card you can trust. You will end up in horrible situations if you trust them. They have made my life hell too many times. I hate them! They blocked features on my card to force me to make transfers between banks and are forcing me to prove every single transfer I make while holding the money in their accounts, thousands of dollars. They solve nothing because it's all on purpose. These are criminals and they should be in jail.
