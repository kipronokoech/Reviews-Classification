Absolutely clean account, used exclusively for our corporate transactions between clients and partners. For every single transaction, we have a payslips, invoices or contracts available from our partners and customers. Wise never asked for any documents regarding transactions - just suddenly deactivated the whole account and our business is now not operational.\n\nAfter sending an appeal we received an automatic answer that the account is closed and amount will be refunded within 2-5 business days. No explanation of the reason. It has been 3 weeks now, still no refund, no clear answer from their customer support. We requested bank statements and saw that they "emptied" our bank account and send our corporate funds to unknown to us account with the statement "manual adjustment by Wise".\n\nWe can see, that they keep saying to most their victims they have internal reasons and investigations that lead to account closure that they cannot disclose. However, Wise did not ask any single financial documents from us to make any reasonable investigation.\n\nWe have already filled a case against Wise with our lawyer and preparing the letter to Financial Ombudsman and Ministry of Economics for withdrawal their bank license. We have also submitted our supportive article about Wise to Harvard Business Review and Forbes Magazine. Both are pending right now, however it was supported by several professors from well known universities and there is a good chance that one of the articles will be published making this the beginning of the end of the Wise Scam Era. We do not wonder now why they have changed their name from Transferwise to Wise. The first and we hope the last Scam Bank ever!\n\nThose, that are victims of Wise Bank, just drop us a line, we will send you a link to sign a digital letter that was prepared by our lawyer for a Ombudsman.\n\nLets unite and stop this illegal Transferwise business, before they scammed other people and businesses.
