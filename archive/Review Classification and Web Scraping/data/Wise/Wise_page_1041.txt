Instead a warning came up saying WISE hadn't received the money for the transfer, and warned me, 'You haven't paid'. Customer service didn't offer any explanation of why WISE would later claim it didn't have money that it had earlier acknowledged it did have. I've used WISE in the past without difficulty, but a financial institution that's not in charge of its payment algorithms and won't admit it lowers its trust rating.
