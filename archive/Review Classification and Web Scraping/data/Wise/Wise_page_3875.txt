This means that any extra money would always be automatically rejected and refunded.\n\nWe'd be happy to take a closer look and advise better at what happened.

Outbound and inbound payments take less than any other bank I've ever used to clear. Coupled with the very reasonable currency exchange fees, I don't understand why anyone would ever need forex services for simple international transactions.\n\nOn top of that, I see Transferwise recently acquired a banking license in Belgium and the UK. That's awesome. Now they can get to call themselves a real bank. I don't know about you, but I'd much rather trust a bank that doesn't offer any lending or credit facilities with my money for deposit accounts, since they're not going to use my money to lend it to others and risk the bank going under.\n\nTheir business model is different than most banks, and as far as I know, they don't touch the deposit money they hold for their clients. This is ideal for a current account. Having this on top of the ease of use, great fees and quickness of payments, I don't see why anyone would use any other bank for simple international trade requirements.\n\nGreat work guys!", 'review_date': '2020-11-04', 'review_time': '15:49:05', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
