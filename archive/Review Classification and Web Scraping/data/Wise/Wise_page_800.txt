Suddenly last month my money didn't arrive. It's been a week now. All I am left with is a false 'Your money should've arrived in your bank' notification from them.\n\nMy bank cannot see any money deposited into my account. As I am the recipient, 'for security reasons' Wise cannot give me any details about the transfer, where it is currently located, and what the hold-up is. It is money that I have earned and apparently, I have no right to know where it is. Why claim that the money should've arrived when that is obviously not the case?\n\nThis has left me completely unable to pay for rent, bills, or food. I don't know how many more days I can keep waking up to this nightmare.\n\nIt is totally unreasonable to withhold money from someone for a week that can easily be proven to be from legitimate sources for work purposes and has been the same, steady amount for months. Avoid, avoid, avoid!\n\nUPDATE: I ended up receiving my money on the same date the sender contacted Wise. It took them 8 days to transfer money from one EU bank account to another.\n\nUPDATE 2: The same thing happened this month. I didn't receive my paycheck, Wise has it. I guess this is just a regular thing now. Bear in mind that I don't even have an account with them. Even if you only use Wise to receive your money you can still get screwed by them. Don't think for a second your money is safe when dealing with this company.", 'review_date': '2022-11-30', 'review_time': '09:59:55', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

Yes, it appears so, but please remember you get what you pay for. I set up a 50K transfer from US to CDN and wired my money to them same day. However, I made a mistake in that I used an old account that had changed from a personal to a trust account. Wise gladly accepted my 50K but then would not send it until they "verified" my account. Despite getting on the phone right away and speaking with someone, it took two days for the "team" to review my transfer and determine what docs I needed to send. I sent those docs within 6 hours of the request only to be told that it would take 5-7 business days to review those docs. What!!!! Obviously, I had to cancel the transfer and send it from a real bank. After I cancelled, Wise said it would take 1-3 business days to get my money back. This morning I get an email saying my bank rejected the return of the money due to an error. When I went into Wise to see why, they had not sent it back using the same wire details that it was sent with. They never asked for any bank details when I cancelled the transfer so not sure why they didn\'t just send it back to where it came from.\n\nBottom line is that the customer support, staffing and processes that Wise has is NOT suitable for business or any time sensitive application because when something goes wrong they just will not address it in a timely fashion. They have had my money for over a week now and I\'m thinking maybe they able to offer low fees by keeping your money for a long time when something goes wrong.', 'review_date': '2022-11-07', 'review_time': '12:54:03', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nNov 8, 2022\nHello, Brett\n\nWe appreciate your honest feedback. While our goal is to complete all payments as fast as we can, we’re a regulated financial institution and as such, we need to carry extra checks on transfers from time to time. This is a routine procedure to help us ensure we’re keeping our platform safe for everyone using (including you) while complying with local regulations.\n\nSpeed is always our priority, but so is diligence. Depending on the case, it can take from hours to several days. Do keep in mind, we always make sure to update you along the way, and you’ll know the status of your transfer at all times.\n\nWe completely understand that it isn't ideal to wait up to many business days, but these checks are mandatory, so there's no workaround or fast track to it. nevertheless we always work as fast as possible.\n\nRegarding refunds—the time it takes for a refund to get paid back into your account depends on a number of things. These include the way you paid for the transfer, the currency you paid with, and how long your bank takes to process refunds. If it's possible we're always refunding back to the account/card where the money came from. More about the timeframes here: https://wi.se/refunddeliveryestimate_\n\nWise", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2022-11-08', 'CompanyReplyTime': '10:04:37'}
