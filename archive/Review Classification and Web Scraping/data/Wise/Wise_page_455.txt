The receipt contains a banking reference that can be used by the bank to track the transfer. Here's how you can download the receipt from your Wise account: https://wi.se/getpdfreceipt_\n\nIf you need more help with your transfer, contact us at https://wi.se/contactus_ or on our social media channels.

The main point is that I am going backwards and forwards between yourselves and my internet company re a DD, whenever they present the DD you won't/can't pay it because it's inadvertently cancelled...the internet co try to send it back but your system won't accept it because it is apparently now blocked....very frustrating.
