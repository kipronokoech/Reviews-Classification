As a loyal customer, I expected smooth transactions, but unfortunately, that has not been the case.\n\nAfter initiating a $47,000 transfer to my Wise account, with the intention of converting it into THB and transferring it to my business account in Thailand, I encountered significant problems. Only 70% of the transfer was completed before all subsequent transactions were abruptly canceled, leaving my funds stuck.\n\nTo make matters worse, I had already paid fees to exchange the funds into THB. However, I am now unable to send the THB anywhere, and my money remains idle. If I want to access my funds, I would need to convert them again and incur additional fees.\n\nThroughout this ordeal, the customer support from Wise has been unhelpful, providing generic responses that do not offer a solution to my problem. I find it disappointing that Wise does not take accountability for the incomplete transfers and the financial inconvenience caused.\n\nI advise potential customers to exercise caution when considering Wise for their international transfers. The risk of encountering incomplete transfers and having funds stuck without a viable resolution is a significant concern. Please weigh these factors carefully to avoid unnecessary fees and inconvenience.\n\nI hope sharing my experience will shed light on the challenges I faced, and I encourage Wise to address these issues promptly to protect the trust and satisfaction of their customers.", 'review_date': '2023-06-17', 'review_time': '12:55:24', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

Do not send any funds to suspicious bank accounts provided by that email sender. If you have sent money somewhere, please reach out to your bank and request a recall. It is also worth it to contact the financial institution you sent money to and request them to investigate the recipient‚Äôs bank account.\n\n3. We strongly encourage you to report the scammer‚Äôs profile to the marketplace/platform you are using to make your sales (i.e. Facebook or Gumtree).\n\n4. File a police report and communicate with local authorities about this scam. If the police get in touch, Wise will happily provide information about what happened. Please share with authorities: the fake wise email address, any fraudulent bank details, the address where you shipped goods, the scammer‚Äôs profile on marketplace, and any other information about the scam.\n\n5. Report that email address to the email provider (i.e. fakewiseemail@gmail.com should be reported as an abuse to Google)\n\n6.
