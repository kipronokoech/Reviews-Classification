After transfer, they get the money but not transfer it. They freeze your money and ask you for documents. I sent driver's license, then they asked for ID or passport because they found that my picture not clear enough is. The picture and resolution of my driving license is 48MP. They phishing your personal information and photos of your ID, driver's license and passports. One driving license is not enough. What do they do with those documents?: sell it or use it to borrow money. Unbelievable that such a company is still active on the transfer market. If you don't want to lose your money and personal information and get into trouble, STAY AWAY from wise. It takes me hours to make a simple transfer. They don't want to do that and tell me stories to phish more personal information. It takes lot of energy and time. And customer service is ridiculous. They just end a conversation with you on chat. They don't want to solve problems. Still phishing for personal information on chat.
