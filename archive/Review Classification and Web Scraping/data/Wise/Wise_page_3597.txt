TransferWise customer service will not make any effort to help you at all but just talk to you as you were stupid repeating what you already know, you\'ve been ripped off but they do not take responsibilities how much you will end up getting once the money leaves their bank account.', 'review_date': '2021-01-06', 'review_time': '11:15:19', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nJan 18, 2021\nHello, Aldo.\n\nThanks for sharing your feedback with us.\n\nPlease keep in mind that when sending USD to an account located outside of the US, this can only be done with SWIFT. Not only with us, but that's just how it works. With SWIFT payments there are intermediary banks involved, and they'll charge their fees as well. However, we can't track those fees, so we can't know upfront how much this payment would cost in total for you. That's why we display the message to remind you that this is a SWIFT payment, and therefore additional charges might occur. All the fees that are charged from our side, are always shown to you upfront.\n\nWe explain more about SWIFT here > https://wi.se/swiftpayments_.\n\nAll the best,\nJackeline\nTransferWise", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2021-01-18', 'CompanyReplyTime': '18:31:10'}
