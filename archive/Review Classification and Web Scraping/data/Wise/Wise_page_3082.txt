I set up an account, and received confirmation that my identification has been completed.\n\n2. I tried to do a transfer and also transferred the money to wise. Post this I was locked out of my account, with a generic "You have been deactivated" message\n\n3. Had to figure out a weird hack through which I could share my personal id that led to the reopening of my account. They then offered to go ahead with my transfer, to which I said yes\n\n4. The transfer did not move for 2+ weeks. The support team was clueless why. My money was stuck with them the entire time\n\n5. I gave up and asked for a refund, and then they asked for additional docs\n\n6. The money still didn\'t come back to my account. On checking in, I was told I need to share even more id proofs. I wrote a (partial) stinker email and received the money in my account a few days later.\n\n\nMy conclusions:\n\n- I will personally not use wise again and will not recommend them to anyone else either. If despite all their funding and success they are as inefficient and clueless as they are, they are clearly spending their money on the wrong areas.\n\n- I could accept that they have a good service in other regions, but specifically for India they have a horrible set of partners. India clearly has difficult regulations to work with, but I am paying wise to make it easier for me. I\'d rather just break my head with my own bank if it\'s going to be as painful with alternatives such as wise.\n\n- They need to conduct a UX audit of their site, especially taking into account negative / failed scenarios', 'review_date': '2021-06-29', 'review_time': '12:34:39', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nJun 30, 2021\nSorry to hear you didn't have the best experience while using us.\n\nWe do our best to complete verification as seamless as we can, but there are times we'll need additional information and while we review that information, delays can happen.\n\nIf you'd like us to take a closer look to understand better what happened, but reach us again at https://wi.se/contactus_\n\nAll the best,\nWise Team.", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2021-06-30', 'CompanyReplyTime': '08:41:22'}

That means they never received the funds and they have no record of it even after providing them with the Mt103 form they couldn\'t trace it. According to Payoneer, since they did not receive the amount and they do not receive wire transfers, the sender\'s bank should trace the funds. Apart from being a statement from Payoneer, this is according to the terms and regulations that if the funds are not received by the receiver\'s bank, the sender\'s bank should trace them.\nI wonder why on earth can\'t trace the funds that you sent and were not received. This is my worst experience ever.\n\n"Reply from Wise (formerly TransferWise)\nAn hour ago\nMake sure to let you bank know this is a SWIFT payment and there are intermediary banks involved.
