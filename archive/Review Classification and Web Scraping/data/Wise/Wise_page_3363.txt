Since you've mentioned already filing a dispute, please note that this process is never an instant one.\n\nWithout taking a closer look at your case, it's really hard to understand what could've happened but there's probably a very simple explanation to it—most likely, one of these transactions is reserved on your balance and Tesco will release it in a few days.\n\nTo confirm this, please contact us on any of our support platforms—social media on Facebook, Twitter or Instagram; or email/phone/chat here: https://wi.se/contactus_\n\nBest,\nAndrea\nWise.", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2021-03-07', 'CompanyReplyTime': '18:08:21'}
