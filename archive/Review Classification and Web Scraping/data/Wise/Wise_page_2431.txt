I guess I was lucky before. My friend warned me 6 months ago when they stole his nearly $40,000 from him while trying to transfer funds from CA to his family in Europe, and could not do anything about that...that is probably why they have changed their name...but now they steal your information. Today I was trying to make a simple transfer of $1,200.00 to a recipient that I have sent money before and they asked me for my SSN, passport and my ID in order to complete this transfer. Not sure who they are selling it to afterwards but I have done quickly some research about this and people that have provided their info this way, they are seeing fraudulent activities on their credit report. I have communicated with customer support via chat in this regard and they were absolutely OK and did not care at all for the fact that I do not like ( since I do not feel safe ) to provide my personal information which by the way has nothing to do with transferring money over their very unfriendly platform. Not very cool. I will never use this company ever again and I do NOT recommend anyone to use them either.\n\nupdated 01.13.22\nI am ok with providing SSN, but on top of that if you ask me for a copy of my ID + my passport and take a selfie of myself I am not ok with entire procedure..just to sen $1,200. My friend told me the entire story, I am going to leave it up to him what he does, this was done when your company had name "Transfer Wise"..he was trying to contact you very many times...and when he did and finally has communicated with someone, that person told him....read this " GOOD LUCK GETTING YOUR MONEY BACK" ....that is all I know...I you can type here whatever you want, it\'s just a task for you, but people in real life they are getting their identity and money stolen by your company or whoever you are selling them to....and that is a shame.', 'review_date': '2022-01-13', 'review_time': '12:18:53', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nJan 13, 2022\nHi, Dalibor.\nWe're a regulated financial institution, and never steal any information- nor share it with any third parties.
