Wise is no different. We’re a regulated financial institution, and verification is how we keep your money safe, and comply with the financial regulations in the countries we operate in. We do our best to complete verification as soon as possible, and it’s usually done within 2 – 4 working days. In rare cases, it might take longer if we need additional information, but we’ll always let you know if that’s the case.\n\nCustomers are our highest priority, and we never want to make them feel like we don't reply or care. However, we're receiving higher volumes lately and our reply times can be longer than expected. Rest assured we’re always replying as fast as possible.We're also actively recruiting new agents to maximise our coverage in all timezones.\n\nWise", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2023-01-24', 'CompanyReplyTime': '12:15:56'}
