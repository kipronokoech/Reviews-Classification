I was under the understanding that others can now send me money just by locating my email on Wise; two people in Denmark has tried but they still get a message that I need to provide them account, IBAN, SWIFT codes etc. I wish that I can find out by logging in to my account that this would be explained; its too hard to find an answer.\nSincerely Marlene Mitchell', 'review_date': '2021-10-29', 'review_time': '22:29:01', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
