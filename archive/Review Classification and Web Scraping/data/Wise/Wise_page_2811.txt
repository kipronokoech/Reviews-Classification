I am an American college student crying in my apartment because Wise deactivated my account without reason or warning. I have no idea what I did wrong and nobody seems to have the integrity to let me know what I can do to regain access to my account. As an American student, I am often USD to Euros. I had about 1000 euros in my account that I was trying to transfer to my European bank. Transferwise will not let me access that money and I have no way of knowing if I will get it back. 1000 euros may seem like chump change to some of you, but to a college student it is literally my entire living expense. I do not know how I will pay rent or eat until I regain access to this money.

I only have two currencies running, including UK pounds, but that's all I need right now. That said, it's good to know I can add more from an extensive list.\nI love the app and find most features on the app easy to access and use. I love being able to see a break down of all my spending and a graph of each month's expenditure.\nTransfers are a doddle and transferring funds from my UK, High Street, bank account to my Wise account, takes around 30 seconds.\nPaying people or businesses is also easy, but the length of time it takes the payee to receive the funds, can depend on what bank they're with, so it can take anywhere between 2 hours and four days - most of the time, it's pretty quick.\nBest of all the charges for transfers are very low and the exchange rates are the best I've encountered anywhere.\nI'm afraid I'm a financial services skeptic, having seen too much poor service in the banking industry, but Wise, so far, has been absolutely brilliant and, on the few occasions I've had a to telephone them, my problems were sorted quickly.\n\nWell done and thank you for being there!\n\nUpdate 12/Jun/2023...\n\nStill going well. App has changed since my above review, but is as good, if not better.
