I called a number of times to reactivate to be told they can’t ant the appeal process could be over 30 days. I can’t access my money, pay bills or receive payments.

{'platform': 'Wise', 'id': '6480d66a59c59a53da36b30f', 'stars': 1, 'title': 'Beware of Wise: Lack of Accountability and Potential Fraud', 'message': "My experience with Wise has been an absolute nightmare, leaving me deeply frustrated and questioning their integrity as a financial institution. I obtained bank details from my Wise account and successfully received a bank transaction within two days. However, when I made a second transaction using the exact same bank details, the payment mysteriously vanished into thin air, never appearing in my Wise balance.\n\nInitially, Wise refused to acknowledge the sender's proof of payment, causing significant confusion and delays. After persistently providing multiple proofs of payment, Wise finally admitted that the payment had been sent to their account. Shockingly, they now refuse to acknowledge its receipt and flatly deny showing any bank statement or providing any other proof of non-receipt.\n\nThis blatant lack of transparency and accountability raises serious concerns about the legitimacy of Wise's operations. Their unwillingness to cooperate, despite clear evidence and their own acknowledgment of the payment, suggests an alarming level of deceit and potential fraud.\n\nI urge extreme caution when dealing with Wise. Their actions have shattered my trust in their services, and I strongly advise others to think twice before entrusting their hard-earned money to this organization.\n\nMy hope is that this review serves as a warning to potential customers, prompting them to reconsider using Wise and encouraging the company to address their deeply troubling practices. Proceed with extreme caution when engaging with Wise, as the risk of potential fraud seems all too real.", 'review_date': '2023-06-12', 'review_time': '17:04:31', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
