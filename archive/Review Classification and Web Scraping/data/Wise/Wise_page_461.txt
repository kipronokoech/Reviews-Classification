I have previously used other companies for the transfer of funds without any hitch but Wise held on to the transfer (in the 10,000s) for a few days saying they needed to repeat the checks my bank had already done and when I went to my Wise account, I saw that the amount of PLN I paid for was now reduced. Since I was paying a bill, a random "other" amount was not an option. After negotiating a bot for quite some minutes to finally get to a human (I just bashed in 99), the customer services chap told me that the exchange rate isn\'t held more than 2 hours and that "it says so in the small print". The delay, from my part, was due to Wise\'s own operating system and they should give a clear warning about reducing or changing any given exchange rate. If I hadn\'t intervened, the incorrect amount would have been sent (I presume)\nI have now left the set up and do not recommend this company at all. There are plenty of others offering the same services but with honesty and alacrity.', 'review_date': '2023-03-09', 'review_time': '16:37:31', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
