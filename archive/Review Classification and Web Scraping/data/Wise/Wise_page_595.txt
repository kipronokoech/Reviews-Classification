I never needed to submit information regarding proof of address or income. Never, ever!

I really want to understand.\n\n\n'Hello,\n\nWhen you open a bank account, you usually need to provide documents to verify details about yourself. Wise is no different. We‚Äôre a regulated financial institution, and verification is how we keep your money safe, and comply with the financial regulations in the countries we operate in.\n\nWe're sorry to hear that you don't have the documents that we need, but this means that we're unable to provide our service to you, as this would go against our policies.\n\nIf you have any questions, or concerns, don't hesitate to reach out:\n\nWise.'", 'review_date': '2022-12-14', 'review_time': '23:35:02', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

Wise consistently advertises the "midmarket" rate, but any foreign customers traveling to Argentina and using the Wise card for their purchases are actually getting charged 60-100% commission depending on the day\'s market circumstances.\n\nIt\'s fine if Wise can\'t provide the "Blue" rate (although they legally can, as of about two months ago, as per Comunicaci√≥n "A" 7630 from the BCRA), but they need to be honest with their customers about this with some form of clearly visible disclaimer or notice.
