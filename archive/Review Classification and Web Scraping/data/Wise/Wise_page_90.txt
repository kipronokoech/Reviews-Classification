When it does, you'll see it in your activity list too.\n\nWe try to move your money as fast as possible, but how long it takes to receive money into your balance depends on the currency you're receiving. Read more about it here: https://wi.se/howlongpaymentsbalance\n\nIf it's been longer than this, send us a proof of payment, so we can check it – the steps are at the end of the page we shared above.\n\nIf you've added money directly through Wise, we'll always let you know the estimated time frame for it to arrive to your account, and all the info related to the transfer will be available in the activity list. Check this link for a guide about how to add money: https://wi.se/addmoneytoyourbalances\n\nWe aim to respond to all emails within 1-2 working days. But remember that you can also reach out to us via phone or social media. All our contact details are here: https://wi.se/contactus, or send us a private message on X (Twitter), Facebook, or Instagram.
