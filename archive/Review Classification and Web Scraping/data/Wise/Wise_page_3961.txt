The transfer is juste Stuck, waiting for verification.\nAfter a few days, 5th of October, I contact the support.\nAfter 2 days, I'm told (kind of generic email) that the delay is my bad, since I haven't sent the requested documents (copy of the identity card)... the issue is that I NEVER received any request from transferwise asking for this (Yes I checked my emails, spam, nothing on the website, and nothing in the mobile App...)\nTherefore I provided the requested details (the explanations to do so were unclear and I had then to send this via email to be sure it would be taken into account).\nI also requested to get clarifications regarding this situation, I never had an explanation regarding the way my transfer was managed.\nOne day Later I finally got the money and a kind of generic email not answering my questions.\n\nI never received any explanation and no excuse from Transferwise. I was in a very tough situation due to this unexpected delay, which should have been much sorter if Transferwise had considered to contact me !!!\n\nI'm concerned about what happened, I was fully trusting this service until now, but the fact that my money was stuck 11 days (!!!), and that I had to manage it and contact Transferwise to get it sorted out is scary.

TransferWise is a safe and regulated way to send money. Verification of our users is required to keep the service safe and compliant for all. When we need to verify your information before we can send out a transfer; we'll ask for this information up front. I see we sent you an email requesting verification on September 30th, when the transfer was set up.\n\nIt's possible emails go to spam or other organizational folders you have set up on your email account. You can also whitelist TransferWise's contact information. We can help you with this as well as review your case again.\n\nFeel free to contact us on social media or here through our support center by email/phone: https://wi.se/contactus.\n\nRegards,\nThe TransferWise Team", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2020-10-13', 'CompanyReplyTime': '16:07:46'}

TransferWise takes account closure very seriously. TransferWise can't legally keep you balances. We work on returning your remaining balances but first must conduct due diligence checks. This can sometimes take up to 60 working days but we keep you updated along the way.\n\nMake sure you submit your appeal, even if you don't want your account reactivated it helps to get you in touch with our appeals team . They also help refund your balances.\nFind the appeals form here: https://wi.se/appeal.\n\nWe'll reach out to you within 1-10 business days via email and assist you further.\n\nRegards,\nThe TransferWise Team", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2020-10-13', 'CompanyReplyTime': '16:12:49'}
