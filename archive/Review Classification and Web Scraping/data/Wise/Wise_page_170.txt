My experience with Wise, which started back in November 2020, has been one of satisfaction, trust, and efficiency. The platform had never let me down in safely transferring hundreds of thousands of Euros until recently.\n\nHowever, it seems the tide has shifted. Despite successfully passing a review of our account on July 20th that had been initiated on July 3rd - an experience that left our business operations hanging for 17 distressing days - we found ourselves in a frustratingly similar situation soon after. On July 20th, right after our account was cleared and a paused transfer was successfully completed, we initiated two additional transfers. To our dismay, both these transfers were immediately put on hold, and our account was placed under review again.\n\nTo say this is frustrating would be an understatement. It's an absolute disruption to our operations and a major hurdle in our financial planning. Despite our efforts to reach out for an explanation or a potential timeline, we find ourselves in the dark once more, unsure of when we can resume our #BusinessAsUsual.\n\nThe recurring theme of opaque and frequent account reviews is an alarming issue that needs immediate redressal. We understand the need for security measures and routine checks. But the lack of transparency, coupled with the fact that a cleared review was immediately followed by another, paints a picture of inconsistency and inefficiency.\n\nWise, this is an earnest call to action. Your loyal customers like us are being gravely affected. It's time to address this issue and significantly improve your review process - make it more streamlined, efficient, and, most importantly, transparent. We hope our concerns are heard and actions are taken swiftly, so we can go back to trusting and praising Wise's services like we used to.
