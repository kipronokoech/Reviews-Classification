Had problems as of late e.g. payments into my account were held up and I was told by a major American bank I worked with that they won‚Äôt allow payments into Wise accounts per se.\nAnother thing that leaves room for improvement: customer care, you can never reach any telephone support, then you end up emailing where it tells you they will respond within one business day, next you‚Äôre informed it ‚Äûgenerally takes two business days‚Äú and what happens next is they do fix the problem that shouldn‚Äôt have been there to begin with but they never responded to your mail‚Ä¶\nDebit cards are another matter. I ordered one for both my accounts only to find they are absolutely useless to me as I can‚Äôt use them to reserve a car or hotel booking and they won‚Äôt allow to withdraw or pay cash into your account which are the only applications I ever use a card for.\nI still give Wise a 3 star rating, the above issues notwithstanding, because it single-handedly solved a banking problem of mine - which is exchanging currencies and participate in intl. banking - even their current fees are still a lot less than what any bank or PayPal charges and it still is super fast. Also the transactions are easy to navigate through and the website has worked ok for me with very few exceptions. If you live in a country that still runs on cash for most day to day financial activities you will find you still need a local bank as Wise accounts are pretty much cashless only, hence no use for anything requiring cash like many smaller shops do because they can‚Äôt afford the ridiculous fees that come with accepting card payment.', 'review_date': '2022-04-22', 'review_time': '08:40:26', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
