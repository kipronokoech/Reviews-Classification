First of all, the online experience of opening an account was not as seamless as other services. They already charged my credit card without my authorization and before I even got through the application process or a confirmation that my card was going to be sent. Huge Red Flag there. So when it did not go through, I saw a credit in my credit card online statement. DO NOT CHARGE FEES WHEN APPLICATION HAS NOT EVEN COMPLETED!!! After a few attempts to get my photos and IDs verified which took a few days, they went through. Then I get an email stating my card will arrive in more than 2 weeks. I tried to call customer service and got the most unenthusiastic and useless person with severely lacking skills to even be in customer service on the phone. I was going to be traveling internationally in less than 10 days so I was trying to get my card sooner. Believe it or not, this service did not have a way to get this card expedited, no digital card, no pick up locations, no overnight deliveries, none! They would not even mail the card to a verified international location (even a local bank pickup). Then the person proceeds to offer me the option to cancel the card but keep my membership. For what?! He said I would have a pre-activated card with very limited options to do any transactions and did not even explain more further. I was also informed I could not open an international account from the country I was traveling to in Asia and he would not transfer me to a manager or another person who could help me out as he severely lacked useful information. Seriously?! Would you trust your money to a company like this who doesn't even want you as a customer, has poor customer service on the day you just got a new account, very unwelcoming and for what- cheaper rates? No thanks! I will gladly pay higher fees for professional services rather than risk my money in a business like this. There are many other similar businesses that are doing better. So the day I got approved to open my account is the day I cancelled it as well. What a waste of time. And I will be reporting them to my Chase credit card company for unauthorized charges. Do not trust this business! I can just imagine the poor customer service once they have already hooked you in and charging you fees.", 'review_date': '2023-07-11', 'review_time': '19:49:02', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nUpdated Jul 12, 2023\nHi there!\n\nWe're sorry to hear about the frustrations you experienced during the account opening process.

Once the order is placed, it's not possible to expedite it.\n\nWe understand your concerns about customer service, and we're sorry if you felt let down by the support you received. We're constantly working to improve our services, and your feedback will help us in that process.\n\nWe'd also like the opportunity to check your case closer, to understand better the charges you're mentioning.
