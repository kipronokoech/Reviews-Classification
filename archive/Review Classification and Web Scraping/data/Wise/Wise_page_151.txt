My transfer process turned into a frustrating ordeal that ended with them closing my account for no valid reason. Here's a breakdown of my nightmarish encounter:\n\nFirst, when completing a transfer, they demanded two personal details that should have been unnecessary for a simple transaction: the purpose of the transfer and my relationship with the sender.\n\nDespite answering all their queries and complying with their face ID verification by providing selfie ID, Wise still decided to close my account without any explanation. It seems they arbitrarily make decisions that affect their customers' financial standing without offering any clear justification.\n\nFurthermore, reading through various reviews from other users, I discovered I wasn't alone in my negative experience. Many others have faced similar issues, and their complaints were often met with dismissive responses from Wise's customer support.\n\nThe worst part is that after deciding to close my account without appeal and transfer my funds elsewhere, I learned that the process can take up to a staggering 40 days. This is an unacceptable delay for anyone who needs access to their funds urgently.\n\nI strongly advise everyone to avoid Wise and beyond. Their intrusive demands for personal information, lack of transparency in decision-making, and extremely slow account closure process are serious red flags that indicate a complete disregard for their customers' well-being.\n\nIn conclusion, steer clear of Wise at all costs.
