At first the system gave an estimated time required (1 hour) to complete verification, but of course it took way longer than expected. It would have been better if the need for verification is informed ahead of time, or done separately from the transfer itself. As for most people, transfers are initiated with the expectation to complete in timely manner. Who has the time to wait up to 5 business days for account verification when a transfer is pending?\n\nSecondly, only employment related statements (pay slip, tax returns etc.) are accepted for account/income verification purpose. In my household, I am the person who manage money transfers while my husband is sole income earner. When calling Transferwise for alternative document options, I was told that my husband must issue a "gift certificate" to me to show that he demonstrate his consent for me to use his income. A joint account bank statement would not be accepted. Ok people, seriously? Are we living in the 21st century?
