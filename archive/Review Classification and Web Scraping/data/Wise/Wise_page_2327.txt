At this point I've probably transferred Â£60,000 or CAD$102,000 and so they are very trustworthy. The fees are the best I've found and in the time I've been using them they have remained consistent with their values of low fees - I just hope they stay that way!\n\nThey now have it so you can open multiple currency accounts and tie those to a card you can use to pay for things on vacation etc. I haven't tried the card but I do plan on doing but I do have multiple accounts and that has been easy to manage.\n\nThe app works great and I transfer money from my bank to wise for conversions which works flawlessly.\n\nThe first couple of transfers take a little longer but only a couple of days but once those are done it's extremely fast (depending on your bank). Mine take less than 24 hours now.", 'review_date': '2022-01-10', 'review_time': '13:26:50', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
