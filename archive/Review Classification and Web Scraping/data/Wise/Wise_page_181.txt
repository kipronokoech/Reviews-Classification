First, they wanted a picture of me with my passport, then connected our bank account, and only then said they needed more information and requested our company formation docs, and then, after we were "approved" and sent our money to our new consultant, they changed their mind and said they couldn\'t verify me because our product name and company name are different (most companies have different product names than the name of their company). They said our company name wasn\'t on our website (which isn\'t true). And cancelled our first payment. So I sent how our company name is on our website, and they "approved" me again, but when I went to send money to our consultant again, they wanted a picture of me holding my driver\'s license. I was going to do that, though annoyed since they already have me with my passport, just to get the money to our consultant, but the enable camera button didn\'t work and that was it for me. Seemed to be too much personal information about me and not so much about protecting me or my company\'s money - they easily and quickly connected right to my bank (they didn\'t need me to verify I owned that). Just started to feel like they were about getting lots of information and then flipping on me twice about being verified. When I sent an email explaining what happened and that I just wanted them to delete my account - they did quickly and kind of happily it seemed with lots of exclamation points and nicely signed from the "The Wise Team!" They don\'t seem to care about the customer and have no problem removing me as a customer and seemed to make me feel bad about even being one. I hope they do refund the $1,500 I attempted to send the first time like they said they were going to, including the fees they charged. We\'ll see. Anyway, thought I would share they are not a good (and possibly safe) company to do business with in my opinion.', 'review_date': '2023-07-14', 'review_time': '21:38:27', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

A week back and forth giving me wrong instructions for uploading the documents and contradicting own instruction in the next email. So i made the decision to stop using this company.
