{'platform': 'Wise', 'id': '628f3c7c045d025d3a9f123f', 'stars': 1, 'title': 'Risk and luck', 'message': 'I had been using Wise for a little more than a year to send money to a friend in the UK, we often borrow and pay back between each other besides which I sent to a Turkish colleague of mine sometimes, from India. For a year everything had been smooth and problem free, I had recommended Wise to my friends and associates too, some of whom took my advice. I was happy with them for providing a reliable solution. Even when in recent times I noticed that their fee got higher and exchange rates were not as competitive as before. Long story short, I never thought I\'d be writing a negative review but I have to so that a small guy like me doesn\'t face the same. As usual, I had made a transfer of a small sum (luckily) to my friend in UK, for the first time I noticed that a security trigger had been pulled, apparently their system classified my transfer for more "checks" which did not clear for the whole day so I contacted their chat support and they informed me that I should check my email, when I did, I was informed that I am not a sender but a recipient and hence I should input the personal details of the sender to clear the transfer, I did not know whether to laugh or be worried about this and trying to clear this confusion with their chat support produced no positive result but to appease them I had to put in personal non volunteered information of the recipient. However they still did not release the funds and I was assured that I could cancel by contacting them. Suddenly, the chat support option vanished and all I had were email and call, to keep a written record I opted to email them and did so, behold a day later I got an email response from them that my transfer had "potentially violated international sanction laws" and as far as I knew, there were/are no such sanctions between India and UK or I wouldn\'t have been able to transact for a year. However soon enough later that day a support executive emailed me and admitted that their system might have triggered a false alarm and that this was beyond their control (then who would have control if not you guys?) and that these "checks" were obligatory for financial institutions. I inquired under which laws and what checks they were performing since public law isn\'t a company secret but they refused to inform me. Since it had already been 3 days at that point, I asked for a cancellation but they said even though I cancelled, they would keep on checking for 5-10 days and not refund my money, without specifying exactly what they were checking nor citing the law under which they were taking action. I did not see the point of having to check a birth date and name for 10 days and my own financial tax payer details were already with them, so I pointed out that even if they have to "check" it is only data and they can take their sweet time to do that but why do they have to refuse to refund my money? It has now been 9 days since I initiated the transfer and they sit quietly doing god knows what with my money, since they are a financial institution, I am sure my money has been used to invest in something that brings them profit while I suffer without it. Basically they are holding my money against any authority of law and have not provided any detailed information to me about my own money. As of now, I am filing a complaint of cyber crime fraud against them and FIR and civil suits will follow. I am owed interest on my money which they are holding hostage without my consent, if you look at it, it qualifies as theft, criminal misappropriation and criminal breach of trust. I conclude by drawing attention to my review title - if you are "lucky" you will have a smooth experience with Wise but sooner or later your luck will run out and your "risk" will factor in. I was lucky that my transferred sum was not huge (Rs. 10000 /-) but it still is something and I shudder to think what would happen if it was more.', 'review_date': '2022-05-26', 'review_time': '10:38:20', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
