The charges are fair and completely transparent. The website is simple to use and very intuitive. You can use both a normal computer or if you are inclined, you can do your transactions using a mobile phone.\n\nUp until a few months ago I would have given a 5 star rating. Until then, Wise had a wonderful UK and European based telephone support team who were able to resolve any issues very quickly. It was fantastic. Unfortunately Wise made the unwise decision (presumably a little more profit?) to remove telephone service. Very occasionally I need to speak with a real human being. I am now required to tap replies and what would have taken a couple of minutes on the phone suddenly can take a lot longer. This is a shame and I really hope Wise reverses this decision as it was a major major advantage compared with it's competitors - especially those who require us to do everything on a tiny mobile phone screen.\n\nIn response to Wise's reply below: I've just checked and if I want to enquire about 'managing my account' or 'verification' I have no phone option. If I want to discuss my wise card, I can indeed call and speak to someone.\nI realise there is a very substantial help centre which answers a large number of very standard questions. Usually I don't have many queries, but a number of them I have found through that database. However, the two areas where one might actually need to speak to a real person to find out an answer to a question are with questions with very specific personal information regarding the account (perhaps a transaction query) or with verification (is this an acceptable document?). Why Wise doesn't acknowledge that having staff who can occasionally answer a phone is odd. Limit it if needs be, but at least have it available. As I said above, the rest of the service is fantastic.", 'review_date': '2021-09-24', 'review_time': '12:15:33', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nSep 24, 2021\nHello Tom,\n\nYou're still able to speak to us over the phone, however, most answers can be found on our FAQ, so we encourage all customers to check there first.
