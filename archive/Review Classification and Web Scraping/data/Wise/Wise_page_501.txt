I\'d heard about them for a long time, and I thought I\'d give them a chance as the exchange rate offered for the transfer was very attractive (it\'s always too good to be true, isn\'t it?). I was initially told that the transfer would take 3 working days, but that\'s ended up being over 12 working days and counting now. I\'ve provided every document they\'ve requested (the last of which was sent to them more than 5 working days ago), called and emailed a dozen times, and tried unsuccessfully to contact them over social media, all for nought. They boast about how you can actually speak to a human rather than a chatbot when you need help, but what\'s the use of that when their frankly incompetent call centre employees cannot actually provide any useful updates?! Their managers "don\'t speak over the phone" and they can\'t transfer you to their infamous Wise \'processing team\' because they\'re "only allowed to send internal emails". The anxiety over not knowing what\'s happened to my hard-earned savings is excruciating. I\'ve honestly lost all faith in these fintech money transfer companies. Learn from my mistake: Be wise and don\'t use Wise. Just pay your bank to do it because saving a few hundred ¬£¬£¬£ is honestly not worth this stress.
