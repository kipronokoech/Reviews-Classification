An IPO, a name change, massive growth, and of course, the same wonderful service - year after year.\n\nUntil, one day recently - we atempt to access our funds and... oh - we cannot. If there\'s one thing - just one single thing - every financial institution must ensure in order to remain viable - it is trust. Clients must have absolute trust and confidence that the funds we entrust them with are safe, and more importantly - can be accessed.\n\nWe\'ve been a verified corporate client (very significant in volume) for many years. Verified account, verified personel, verified accounts, great relationship with their team - we\'re even shareholders. However, without warning - suddenly, access to our funds has been frozen - instantly recalling past nightmare scenarios so many have experienced with Paypal (notorious for arbitrary freezing of user funds).\n\nWise always felt like the good guys, the antidote, in a sense, to Paypal. Account has been verified for years, with no issues of any kind - and suddenly... there is an issue: and it\'s Wise.\n\nHaving our funds frozen, means - we cannot serve our clients or provide payments to contractors. Wise\'s \'support\' in such a case? "Send us an email". Not even phone support (quite literally on their English language page, it says that phone support in the selected language (English) is not possible. Really? This is a British company, isn\'t it?\n\nWe\'ve reached out to them - with no response as of yet. Our funds remain frozen, and we\'re scrambling to access other methods to continue serving our customers, and contractors. While not everyone is this fortunate, at least, here in Switzerland, there are strict regulations governing customer access to funds. While this sort of behavior maybe business-as-usual in other jurisdictions - it isn\'t, here in Switzerland. Without a prompt resolution, FINMA will be made aware of this.\n\nIt\'s truly a shame, as we have been a massive fan of Wise for years. We\'ve recommended them to countless clients, we\'re shareholders (both privately and corporate), and the volume of business we\'ve brought them puts us among their top corporate clients.\n\nTo suddenly have access frozen - after years of issue-free business, with no immediate support available (other than \'send us an email\', and no reason for the arbitrary denial of access to funds given - it\'s a shame. It truly is.\n\nIn an odd way, I\'m more frustrated as an investor - than I am as a client. I have been very bullish on this company, but seeing their disregard for fostering trust and confidence among their clients in the service (and knowing how fundamental trust and confidence among clients of any financial institution is, especially considering recent global events in the sector), my thesis is shifting.\n\nWe will begin seeking alternative providers here in Switzerland, and likely begin moving our business away from them. The trust - is broken.\n\nA truly unfortunate end to what once was a very promising relationship between our company, and Wise.', 'review_date': '2023-05-04', 'review_time': '14:33:56', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
