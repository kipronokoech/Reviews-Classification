{'platform': 'Wise', 'id': '618119a775069a4da496bc4f', 'stars': 1, 'title': 'Usually good, but beware of this!', 'message': 'Much like the last review, I am unhappy with the current situation at Wise (after eight great years working with them). First of all, I fully understand they are a financial institution and their need to control for money laundering/running checks.\n\nThe problem is that they run these checks with no advance notice and randomly on their clients. That means a company that provided super fast service before cannot be counted on to do that every time and send money quickly anymore. Your money might arrive in 10 seconds or it could be in limbo for a week.\n\nThe craziest thing is that once they decide to run the checks your money is held hostage and you cannot cancel the transfer so you can find another option. So I set up a payment that was due on November 1 on October 28 and now I have accrued a late fee because they decided without advance warning to run a check.\n\nBy the way, this is a repeat of a transfer I have made before and it\'s not a large amount of money we are talking about. Unless they can do better with this I\'ll have to find a different company to work with.\n\nMy five-star experience with Wise has gone, and yours most likely will be too once this happens to you.\n\nUpdate: Although Wise told me they took my money to pay for the transfer on October 28, they sent me an email on November 11 telling me they had not received it yet and had completed my transfer, thereby I have to pay them all over. The whole reason they said they could not cancel my transaction was because they had "already received my money." A lie. At least they could be honest with their clients (?), the money was not taken in October.\n\nIn addition, they ended up taking TEN days to make the transfer after "running some checks" and then more or less ghosting me with customer service. I incurred a late fee on the payment that was due November 1.\n\nThey have gone from hero to ZERO in my book.\n\nSecond update:\nI have received the standard and canned reply from Wise which does not address any of my concerns. They cannot be relied upon to move a client\'s money quickly anymore (it could be ten minutes or ten days as they freely admit), so I\'m moving elsewhere.', 'review_date': '2021-12-14', 'review_time': '10:32:59', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nDec 14, 2021\nHello, Mark.\n\nWhile we don't have enough details to check your account, we‚Äôre a regulated financial institution and as such, we need to carry extra checks on transfers from time to time.
