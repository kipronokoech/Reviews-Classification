It makes you feel awful asserting the case for basic service (i.e. please can you waive the new card fee for this faulty card only to be told no, reasserting, being told yes but the action not being completed) with the least well paid staff all while you are doing the most privileged of things - travelling.\n\nI had to suggest the solution of a new card and at the fourth week mark I was told that digital cards were also an option. Helpful information week one! They also did not refund their fee for money that I couldn't use because the card didn't work (I had to get cash out with a different bank card). These are tiny principled actions that a CSR could do but they clearly have no authority to do so.\n\nIn fairness, their offer is outstanding and they're IT/digital interface has worked quickly in the past.
