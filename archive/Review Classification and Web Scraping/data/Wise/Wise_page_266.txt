But why are they not done with the very first payment? Why is it getting flagged after 3-4 transfers from the same company? Also why are we flagging payouts already done in the past and holding the current incoming transfer? This cannot be normal practise. If you had questions about an old payment done one month back, you should have emailed and asked within the same week.
