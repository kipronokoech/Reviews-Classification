Now almost every payment disappears when it is supposed to be paid, there is silence when you enquire as to the status and a digital shrugging of shoulders. The whole thing is starting to appear like a fraud designed to manipulate the exchange rate whilst the funds sit in no mans land whilst the the customer service reps (another misnomer) steadfastly refuse to involve anyone more senior and simply say you can wait, because clearly they have little to no interest in complying with their own promises.\nIn short unless someone gets hold of this company and turns it around its either going to fall flat on its face as it lists on the london stock exchange or end up the subject of a serious fraud office investigation.", 'review_date': '2021-04-19', 'review_time': '10:42:39', 'CompanyReply': 'Reply from Wise\nApr 27, 2021\nThanks for your feedback, Simon.\n\nFirst we\'d like to say we have changed our name simple because we\'ve grown so much in the past years that we\'re much more than just a money transfer service.

We could be carrying financial or verification checks, or it could be because of the weekend, or a technical issue from our side. However, no matter the reason, we\'ll always keep you updated along the way.
