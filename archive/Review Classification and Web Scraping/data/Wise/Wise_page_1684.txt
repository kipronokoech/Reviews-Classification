Wise is fully aware of this and is still ignoring my requests for a refund.\n\nMy sincere, sincere appeal to anyone who has a Wise account (business or personal) is to get out of Wise whilst you can otherwise you too will become a victim. Wise is a Ponzi Scheme and needs to recruit new customers who place their funds into the scheme to pay these customers who are closing their account and withdrawing their money. This process repeats itself over and over again, as each layer of previous customer leaves a new layer of customers is needed to pay of the layer of customers who is leaving. That is why Wise gives such a high referral fee of £75.00 which is much higher than any other bank or e-money platform in the market. Its a very high incentive to attract new customers which are desperately needed.\n\nPlease leave these digital e-money platform like Wise and move to a more traditional high street bank where at least your money will be safe. The high street banks are developing their own digital bank platforms where you money will continue to be safe.\n\nPlease to save your livelihood please close your Wise account and save yourself and livelihood.\n\n#SaynotoWise.", 'review_date': '2022-05-26', 'review_time': '21:10:41', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nMay 31, 2022\nHello LB,\n\n\nWe understand having your account closed is frustrating, but rest assured this is never done without a reason.
