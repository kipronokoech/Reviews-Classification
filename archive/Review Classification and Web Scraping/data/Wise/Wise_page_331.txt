We understand how this could be frustrating, but your Wise European IBAN should be perfectly acceptable in Germany.\n\nWe‚Äôve noticed that some banks and merchants around the world don‚Äôt always accept Wise IBANs. Rest assured, this isn‚Äôt just a problem that Wise faces. It‚Äôs a problem for people across all of Europe. But it‚Äôs illegal.\n\nYour employer isn't legally allowed to do this, and they're required by EU law to accept IBANs from other member states of the European Economic Area (EEA). If they don't, you can report them to the relevant authority in your country. You can also make a report here: https://www.acceptmyiban.org/\n\nShould you have other questions, please reach out to us here: https://wi.se/contactus_ or on Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram with your email and user number.
