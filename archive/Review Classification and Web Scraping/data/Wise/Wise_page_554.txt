Since there has been a breakdown in communication with an outstanding sum of funds (£11,000 +) which has distressed me greatly. I would like to offer the last chance before taking action if this matter is not resolved within a reasonable timeframe.\n\nI am requesting that my funds be released immediately as I have done no wrong! My personal life has been in financial difficulty since a large sum of my funds were on Wise, as I trusted the service provider.\n\nGiven that I do not hear back soon, I would be left with no choice but to report this abuse of power and take this up for a formal complaint. I hope we can come to a mutual resolution and that I can receive custody of my funds.\n\nYours sincerely,\nzied Jomaa', 'review_date': '2022-12-21', 'review_time': '22:44:58', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

Unfortunately, there is no answer option for this situation in your dropdown list - no field for "savings" or "deposits" (german edition).\n\nNevertheless, my transfers are authorized by me, and are also legal. The current referrals are made for the following reasons: We are a group of friends who are planning a rather expensive trip to Uganda (gorilla trekking). So we have collected the money from the participants and now want to transfer it to the Ugandan tour operator via Wise. But this fails because you require proof of income - although this money is not "my" income at all, but trust deposits from our friends.\n\nAlthough I have written to you several times now and described the situation, I only receive text modules as an answer, e.g. how I can upload my photos better, or what information for the proof of income is required. None of this fits.\n\nActually, I am a fan of your service and promote it here in Africa at every opportunity. But now I have to go back to using a normal bank transfer because no one in your company really cares about your customers\' problems. I am quite disappointed – and hope, this review will help to improve your service and customer care.', 'review_date': '2022-12-22', 'review_time': '03:57:01', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
