I\'ve got first transfer timing, like unusually, one business day, then it were changed to Friday, 18/2/22, meaning 1 week! to conduct “regular” check (I don’t know what does it mean since I made regular transfers to the SAME OWN account in other country MONTHLY) . Fine. On Friday evening the delivery timing just… disappeared! "Need additional time to check your transaction". No questions, no requests of any documents, no feed-back. Anything. Occesionally I understood that they want my salary confirmation once I started to create a new transactions... I immediately sent it, and now more then 30 hours later NO information where is my money and when I\'ll get it back as I decided to cancel the transfer having so terrible service.
