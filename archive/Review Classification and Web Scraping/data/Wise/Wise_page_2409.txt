Unfortunately when they decide you are suspicious they do not get to the point of the matter and sort it out, but rather resort to sudden refunds of transferred funds, or accepting payments but then decide to 'hold' it for 24 hours for 'checking'. No consistency, with payments going through the one day, and getting held the next.\nAnyone would appreciate the security but there is no recourse, with a call centre unable to resolve any issues and only able to pass messages to the correct department, which then takes anything from 24 - 48 hrs to get back to you.
