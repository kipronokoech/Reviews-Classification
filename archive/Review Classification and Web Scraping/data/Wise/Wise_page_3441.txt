After I was told the people in "the back room" can\'t tell me what checks they are doing?\n\nAbsolutely I get that they are dealing with high volumes and I\'m not special bit surely there is someone who can clarify what these checks are and past experience would be able to advise me on whether I should wait or whether I should cancel.\n\n\nOk so after the 4 days of checks it was resolved. With a very shhh shhh sit condescending message. I do not recommend sending money if it\'s time critical. But the service did finish and if you\'re reading this because they are being truly obtuse and shh shh sit with you too. It did work for me.... however the stress I went through and I did lose the flat i needed the money for to put the deposit down on. If banks were not worse I\'d never use again. I suggest you put money thru bitcoin services if you do that it can be even less fees.', 'review_date': '2021-02-25', 'review_time': '00:58:35', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

There seemed to be undue delays in adding the money to my euro account especially the second tranch which was paused. It took a `chat` to find out that my identity needed further clarification. How did the first tranch go through & the second not ??? The first link I was given to upload ID came up as `error - page not found`. Simo on chat was very helpful & sent another link (/other) and all was sorted very quickly after that. It would have been much better if I had been notified that new ID was needed rather than just to see `paused` with no explanation.\n\nHope this helps,\nJohn', 'review_date': '2021-02-11', 'review_time': '17:10:57', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
