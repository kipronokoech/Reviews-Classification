Second, the online shop refunded me a few days later after asking them to, but had to give information I was not ok with giving at the time and this is one of the reasons card numbers get stolen more. So -1 start for this, and giving the run around and may decline chargebacks if you have a big issue, so again do NOT keep money here you might lose.\n\nSecond, if you load money with a credit card, your card issuer or bank will charge you fee for taking out cash, but Wise will NOT allow you to take this money off the Wise card at an ATM from what I have been reading, and your card issuer will charge a fee from 3.50 to 7.50 per charge with Wise, so it's better just to use your debit card/bank account for a push payment and pay less of a fee so - 1 star for this, and not telling us right at the page where we are loading.\n\nMy thoughts, would be to just use the service to make quick payments, leave 0.00 in your account afterwards, and if you run into an issue you may be left hung out to dry in my case with the theft of less then 20.00.", 'review_date': '2022-01-08', 'review_time': '09:06:06', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nFeb 10, 2022\nThanks for sharing your feedback with us, Steven.\n\nIt's very safe to keep money on your balances - big or smaller amounts - you just have to keep an eye when sharing your account details or allowing direct debits. It seems like the merchant charged you when they shouldn't, and we can't prevent that. In this case, they are the ones who should realize a mistake was made and refund you (which seems to be the case). You can dispute a transaction, but we always recommend that you speak to the merchant first.\n\nSome banks might charge you as cash advance when paying using your credit card, but then again, nothing from our side, rather a charge made by them. If you have our Wise card you can withdraw money from ATM.\n\nDo keep in mind ATM terminals are run by banks, and they'll charge their fees as well.\n\nWise.", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2022-02-10', 'CompanyReplyTime': '10:29:28'}
