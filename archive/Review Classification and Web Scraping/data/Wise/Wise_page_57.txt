All along I had been sending money to my Wise account by wire transfer up until August 2023 when I switched over to funding through ACH debits, simply to reduce the expenses incurred on wire transfers. The first ACH transfer was credited immediately but the subsequent transfers have taken up to four days with money debited from my US account in less than a day but not getting the Wise credit until a number of days later. I reached out to their support and each time got a canned response asking me to hold tight. I am a former banker, very familiar with how ACH works. I pointed out to them that it is not proper to withhold funds for this long and that someone, whether Wise or their ACH processor, is benefitting from Federal Funds Rates at the expense of the customer. I have requested that my question/complaint be escalated to management and have not heard back from them. I am well aware of their fine print mentioning how long a transfer could take, but when I see my funds go into a holding pattern clearly for an unreasonable time it is unjustified. Especially when I lose on exchange rates.', 'review_date': '2023-10-04', 'review_time': '15:04:52', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
