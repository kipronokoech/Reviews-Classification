This did work in the past, so obviously some recent update slipped past QA, which isn\'t terribly reassuring.\n\nMoney management is great if you\'re receiving a major currency i.e. USD, GBP or EUR which is my typical use-case as a freelance programmer, conversions inside Wise to Philippine Peso offer a good and fair exchange rate, very happy with that "direction" of money transfer.\n\nHowever, trying to load money in from the Philippines (e.g. if I wanted to send say USD to my daughter in the States) is a pain as you don\'t offer any loading options for my native currency, and I can\'t even link my local bank account to load money in, despite being able to receive money on that very same account within 6 hours.\n\nSo I\'m forced to use a Philippine credit card in Philippine Pesos to load USD, incurring both the crappy credit card exchange rate AND cash advance fee, and then Wise also charge 4.4% (22 USD on a 500 USD load, really you don\'t think this is a tad excessive?) just for the privilege of putting money into my account.\n\nThis means overall Wise is no more competitive than say Western Union or Paypal when all the expenses are considered.\n\n3 Stars because for certain use-cases with major currencies I find the platform very efficient and fair. But for other use-cases involving minor currencies, absolutely terrible with excessive loading fees.\n\nI look forward to you expanding your currency loading options to cover more countries in future, at which point I\'d be happy to give a higher rating.', 'review_date': '2021-10-28', 'review_time': '00:02:05', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nDec 1, 2021\nThanks for sharing your experience with us, David.\n\nWe're always working hard on adding new currency routes, and hopefully soon sending from PHP will be possible as well.
