Unfortunately the property I was selling to finance the purchase fell through so I had to scramble to get the funds. I sold a classic car and borrowed from my Dad‚Ä¶a short term loan. When I transferred the Sterling sum to Wise the questions I got from Wise were intrusive and questioned my honesty and integrity. They claim they were regulatory which maybe the case. But ultimately they asked for a copy of the loan agreement between my 95 year old Father and me. Bank of Mum and Dad is not like a commercial bank don‚Äôt they know. They even wanted me to show paperwork for the sale of my car which I sold privately. Needless to say I‚Äôve returned my funds and will use MoneyCorp.

Those fees, we're unable to predict. That's why we recommend you send the local currency instead whenever you can.
