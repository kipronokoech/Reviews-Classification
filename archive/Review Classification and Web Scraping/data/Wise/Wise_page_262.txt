I have been verified for a year. Suddenly they want to do it again. Rejected 4 times. I called them, some photos were accepted, some rejected. WTH????? If they were accepted, why are you asking for more? I am pretty sure the people doing verification are vindictive and/or their process is utter garbage. Stay away from Wise.com. You walk into a bank or credit union and they will take care of you right there on the spot. These guys just keep pinging the issues back and forth and nothing gets resolved. Garbage company.\n\nEdit: Their customer service on the phone stated several times they have to do these verifications because they are a BANK. Wise.com is not a bank. By saying they are one, they are braking the law. They don't have a bank charter in the US and thus they are misrepresenting themselves. A big no no.
