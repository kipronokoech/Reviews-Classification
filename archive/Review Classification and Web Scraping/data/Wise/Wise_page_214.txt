If it was salary slips from 1989, I am not prepared to jump through the hoops for an account I use just for my travels.\nSo, today , I withdrew ALL my money from the WISE account and moved to Revolut. It is not worth the stress I am put through by some compliance staff who probably knows nothing about how retirees live with their savings, investments (which I provided bank statements to prove).\nEnough is enough,.

I have no way of logging into my Wise account since it was closed down by Wise. I had sent numerous emails and made calls to customer services and asked where is my money and I didnt get any updates to whereabouts my money is currently and no way of getting my money back to me. It is a FRAUDULENT company because I went to the local registered office and there is no physical office. This is a SCAM and a BOGUS company. DO NOT use their financial services because you wont see your money if they decided to pull the plug on your account. What they list in their website is utter rubbish and fraudulent. Today is June 29, 2023 and I still havent heard from Wise or received a refund of my money. BEWARE and warned. Do not use Wise for any money transfer transactions. Once your account has been blocked by Wise, you have no way of logging in to retrieve your money.
