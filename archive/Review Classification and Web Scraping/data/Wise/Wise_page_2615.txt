When I wrote to the customer care, I got an email saying routine checks are still pending and this is "part of being a financial institution". What they have conveniently forgotten is, it is also part of being a professional any institution to stick to the timelines they have committed to.\nIt was a big mistake doing business with TransferWise for over a year.', 'review_date': '2021-11-02', 'review_time': '21:17:53', 'CompanyReply': 'Reply from Wise\nDec 14, 2021\nHello there,\n\nWhile our goal is to complete all payments as fast as we can, we’re a regulated financial institution and as such, we need to carry extra checks on transfers from time to time.
