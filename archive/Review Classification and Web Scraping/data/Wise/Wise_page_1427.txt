My bank would not transfer sums above £10000 from my UK account and therefore I had to make two transfers to Wise. I contacted the Wise live chat prior to the transfer taking place, where I was assured in writing that the two transfers would be combined at their end and that the original quote would stand. The transfers went through separately and I was charged twice by Wise (not by my bank) with very little help from Wise live chat and an email which did not answer my question.

It might happen that you need to send several smaller transfers over the course of a few days. It will still go under one transfer, but the rate might change, since we're working with a guaranteed rate which is only set for a certain time period. Unfortunately we can't control fees from your bank and if you need to make more than one transfer, then you also need to pay the fees for every transfer.\n\nIf anything we're always here for you at https://wi.se/contactus_ or on our social media channels.\n\nWise", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2022-07-12', 'CompanyReplyTime': '11:26:33'}
