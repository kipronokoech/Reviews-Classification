But since this company contracted with Plaid, every so often, random transfers become verified by Plaid and you go around and around in circles adding your banking log-in information, re-entering, waiting, re-entering again, only to be told you must re-establish your account with Wise. This totally frustrating incompetence has been happening on a monthly basis for routine transfers. Wise no longer functions! If you break down the amount you are sending into smaller amounts (Ex: $1,000 into two amounts $499 and $501) the transfer sometimes goes through but you pay twice for the transactions. Then your money sits somewhere in limbo for an indeterminate amount of time while Plaid verifies your money. Sometimes Wise works within seconds, but if you are unlucky, your transaction will be directed to Plaid and you are screwed.
