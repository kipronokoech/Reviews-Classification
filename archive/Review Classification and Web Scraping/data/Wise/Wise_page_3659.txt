If for any reason the transfer is canceled and you need to make a new one, then you will receive a new rate.\n\nIf your transfer is still active it would be best if you reviewed the details and double checked the reason why it was sent back with your recipient.

For example, when the transaction is set up, we are immediately asked if the payment to TransferWise has been made. But we are unlikely to transfer the payment to T before setting up the transaction. So, to accelerate the process, we say that the payment has been paid and then go and make the payment. Also, it is a bit annoying to have a business transaction held up while T asks all sorts of questions about it, when you have already given a full explanation of the business you conduct when opening the account.', 'review_date': '2020-12-21', 'review_time': '11:00:32', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nDec 21, 2020\nHello, Malcolm.\n\nThanks for your review!\n\nWe're required by law to ask additional information at some point.
