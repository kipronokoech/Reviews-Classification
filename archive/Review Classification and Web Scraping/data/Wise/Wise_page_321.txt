We appreciate all customer input as it helps us improve our services. We're sorry to hear that you've had a negative experience, and we'd like to address your concerns.\n\nRegarding the verification process, on May 22nd, we emailed you with clear instructions on how to do it — verification is a very important step for us, and because of that we’re very diligent with this process. Speed is our priority, but so is keeping your money and our platform safe. When there is a delay, it means we need a little more time to verify the information you have shared, and updates are shared as soon as everything is completed from our side.\n\nWhen it comes to our exchange rates, we provide the mid-market rate. We source this rate from Reuters, which updates in real-time during trading market opening hours. For more detailed information, you can visit https://wi.se/mid-market-rate-\n\nWe understand your concern about charges and fees. Our mission is to make sending money affordable and accessible to everyone. While we're not there yet, we continuously work hard to minimize fees. Currently, we have no subscriptions or monthly fees, and we always show you the fee upfront, so you only pay for what you use. Our ultimate goal is to reduce fees as much as possible, and make them free in the future.\n\nWe value your trust and want to assure you that we're continuously working on improving our services.\n\nWise", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2023-05-30', 'CompanyReplyTime': '09:43:13'}

We\'re sorry to hear about the issues you\'ve encountered. We understand that this has been frustrating for you, and we want to help clarify the situation.\n\nLet us explain how your GBP account details work. When you receive account details, they allow you to receive payments like a local in GBP. If someone is sending you GBP from the UK, you should share the "Inside the UK" details. However, if the transfer is from outside the UK, it needs to be in USD or EUR via SWIFT, and you should share the "Outside the UK" details. You cannot receive GBP to GBP from outside the UK.\n\nRegarding the Apple transactions being rejected, we apologize for any inconvenience caused. If we decline your card payment, we always provide a reason, which you can find in your Transactions. Additionally, if you have push or emails notifications turned on, we\'ll inform you of the reason there and then. For more information, please visit: https://wi.se/declinedtransaction_\n\nWe truly value your feedback and understand your frustration.
