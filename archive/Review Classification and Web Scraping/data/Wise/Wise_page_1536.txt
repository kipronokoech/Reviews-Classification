No one contacted me or attempted to resolve the issues I and my company are now facing. Interestingly once your accounts are blocked you have no access to them so you are unable to access their customer support system through the app and all of your information is no longer available. Allow me to share with you firstly what has happened to a legitimate US company transacting hundreds of thousands of dollars through WISE for over a year and a half. It must be noted that I also had a personal account along with some of the members of my family along with a business account US based and without any notice ALL my accounts were blocked on June the 5th 2022. It must be noted that prior to this sudden move from WISE we had obviously submitted all required documentation as we are fully compliant yet we have been given the run around for weeks. As previously mentioned, once they arbitrarily decided to block our accounts we had to chase them and figure out how to reach them. We tried calling and finally reached someone who assured us they would escalate the issue as he could not find the reason why the sudden blocks yet it has been over weeks and every day we are being given the run around. Please note that they also have blocked thousands of dollars from our business account, my personal and my family's. This is feeling and smelling like a crime and with no recourse from the law we are feeling helpless. I am now in contact with my in house legal counsel and we will begin investigating our legal options to remedy this tragic turn of events. The public needs to be aware that this can happen to them just as it has happened to us. We had our entire financial system for international wire transfers set up through direct deposit through their platform so needless to say this is costing our company money and could have crippled a small operation. I am appealing to the authorities and to the review boards of this financial institution for assistance.", 'review_date': '2022-06-23', 'review_time': '16:48:10', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
