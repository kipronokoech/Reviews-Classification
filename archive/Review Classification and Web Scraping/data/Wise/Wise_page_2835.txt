This means we cannot pay suppliers although Wise is very happy to continue recieving money into the account ! This is a deal breaker, I would avoid this service.\n\nI may add that contrary to the response below transferwise have not kept us updated along the way ( a long way which is lasting over 6 weeks now). This is a company which opens accounts for businesses everyday so to decide once our account has a significant amount of money in it that it needs to run additional verifications is ridiculous. It should have asked for all documents at the begining before allowing us to use the account. Furthermore, we have had to go through the Financial Ombudsman Service to get to them as the FCA have said there isn't much they can do. I sent a formal compaint on the 9th of September ( after many many unofficial pleas to update us ) and have been told that they intend to get back to me by the 30th of September. They may claim to be regulated but they don't play by those rules and as i've discovered there isn't much you can do about it.
