There are a few reasons for accounts to be deactivated. It's normally the result of a conflict with our Terms of Use or due to a discrepancy with a financial law. We explain more here and the next steps here: https://wi.se/accountdeactivation_\n\nIf the account holder has more questions, they can always contact us here: https://wi.se/contactus_ or Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram.
