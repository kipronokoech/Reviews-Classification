They do not respond to all my emails and calls, and one of their employees told me that they transferred the money to my account two weeks ago from the date of writing this review, but when I talked to my bank, I found out that they had lied.\nThe best way to deal with this scammer is to take legal action. I got a lawyer because they do not answer emails and phone calls and they should be dealt with by the law.\nIf you decide to join Wise, please read negative reviews on this website and please do not do it at all. Use your own bank for any transfer. I know this will be more expensive and will take longer but it is safe.\nAnother point I found out is that these companies are all related to each other and the safest way is just to transfer money through the banks.', 'review_date': '2022-01-07', 'review_time': '10:58:56', 'CompanyReply': 'Reply from Wise\nFeb 10, 2022\nHello Moss,\n\nWe understand having your account closed is frustrating, but rest assured this is never done without a reason.
