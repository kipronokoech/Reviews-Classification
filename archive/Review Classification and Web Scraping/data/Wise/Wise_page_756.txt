On November 10 I transferred a significant amount of money from my business bank account to Wise in order to pay a vendor overseas. Before I hit the send button it said this ACH transfer should take minutes then afterwards it said there was a delay (there was not a delay in taking it out of my business account) and it could take up to 6 days which is not accurate for an ACH. My bank confirmed this transfer should have been received on the night it was transferred to Wise. The Wise rep lied in emails and said I would receive it November 16th and it didn't arrive. Now Wise isnt' returning any of my emails. I have contacted my attorney and will contact the State agency and Federal agency that oversees Wise. I fear this money is lost and hopefully others don't lose what I no longer have.
