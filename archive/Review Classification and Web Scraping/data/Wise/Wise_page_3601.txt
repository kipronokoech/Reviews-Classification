They were keep saying that the delay is due to ordinary checks!\n\nFinally I had to borrow to avoid extra charges for late payments. It would be very difficult to take the risk and trust them again, as holding money for 16 days for ordinary checks, it is simply unacceptable.', 'review_date': '2021-01-05', 'review_time': '01:45:44', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nJan 12, 2021\nHi Ian,\n\nThanks for taking the time to share your experience with us. We're sorry to hear it hasn't been good this time, and we value your feedback.\n\nWe understand having your money held up is frustrating and not ideal. The last thing we want is to lose your trust. The checks we conduct are required because of how we're regulated as a financial institution. Sometimes these checks can take longer than others, but please be assured we're doing everything we can to complete it in the best and fastest way possible.\n\nBecause of the recent holidays and an uptick in activity, we've had a backlog to work through first. We want to make sure each case is given the appropriate amount of attention and this can take quite some time. We hope that moving forward we can continue working together and assure you we'll always be transparent.\n\nThanks,\nThe TransferWise Team", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2021-01-12', 'CompanyReplyTime': '15:37:44'}

The only kink I have experienced is in 'linking' the our 'sending' account to what seems to be an intermediary Wells Fargo account belonging to TW, so I would advise TW to provide a bit more instruction on what to do there. Once that link is established, it is a simple matter of transferring funds to the WF account, while on your bank's website, after being prompted to do so on the TW site (after initiating the TW process). That is, the overall process involves using the two websites. TW shows tracking info and sends updates on the processing by email. The TW website uses dual security measures each time you log on (the second a code sent by text to your phone), so that seems reasonably secure.
