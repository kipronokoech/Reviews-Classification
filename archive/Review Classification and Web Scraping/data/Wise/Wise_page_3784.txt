No form of communication. First they said the transfer will take 3-4 days and they claim to be 8x faster than a bank and whatnot, but it turns out a transer that would take 1-2 days with a bank ended up never coming. They didn't tell me that they have locked my account and stolen my money! I tried logging into my account and it said that my account was deactivated and they would give me my money back withing 2-5 working days or somethign like that. That was almost a month ago and I haven't gotten anything back!\n\nThey are just lying and scamming people. They want me to verify myself even though I've already done it when I sent the transfer. I proceeded to verify myself 4 mroe times and every time I just get a generic automated message repeating that I should verify myself again and again. Whenever I e-mail their customer service it's the exact same answer. Just some generic bs with different names.\n\nOn top of it I have to wait more than a week between every single answer that I get and they just keep repeating the same thing.\n\nI recommend transferwise if you want to just throw your hardearned money away and give it to these ruthless scammers. They don't give you a reason, a warning or a solution. Not even a proper answer... They just want you to give up and keep your money. I tried making a refund from my bank, but they've already taken the money out of their bank account and moved it to another account, so it's impossible. I have the ARN codes from the bank that let me follow the transaction and I can assure you. This is their scheme. Perhaps some people have had luck with them, but I'm sure that a big portion of the positive reviews are nothing but fake. If you go through them you're going to notice how similiar they are. Even in different langueges.\n\nIf anyone has any tips on what I can do in this situation, please, contact me and help me.", 'review_date': '2020-11-25', 'review_time': '09:40:06', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nDec 2, 2020\nHello Elon,\n\nWe're sorry to hear about your account.

Unfortunately, my latest experiences are very much subpar one - not just for TW but the industry average. On one occasion a payment was delayed for 2 weeks *after* TW had confirmed that the transfer was on its way to the recipient and TW failed to provide an adequate explanation despite my request for clarification. I work in finance myself and am fully aware of the need for regulatory checks limits what TW can do but it is the customer service that left me very disappointed. Then came the last transfer, where the fees charged were 7(!) times more than was earlier advised - I had to request clarification again and am waiting for a clear answer. As far as I am concerned TW is losing its customer focus and they have certainly lost me as their customer until they fix all these issues.\nUPDATE: Despite the below comment from TW, the company\'s lack of customer service and transparency remains in conflict with its brand promise to its consumers. TW did charge more than they advertised, which resulted in my transfer cancellation and consequent delay in funds returned. The response from TW below falls flat as did their last email from the support team wishing "a blissful week" right after informing me that it would take up to 10 business days to return the funds.', 'review_date': '2020-12-09', 'review_time': '10:10:03', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nDec 2, 2020\nHello Alex,\n\nWe're sorry to hear your experience with us didn't go as expected.\n\nWhenever money runs through a financial institution of any sort, it's a regulatory requirement to run routine checks.
