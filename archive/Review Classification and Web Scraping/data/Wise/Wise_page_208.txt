Ordering WISE card', 'message': 'As an update to my review based on Wise\'s reply.\n\nWise indicated that "transparency" is one of their main pillars. According to Wise the charges are NOT related to Wise, which is why they cannot post them. If that is the case, Wise should at least warn customers of the potential foreign transaction fees their card issuer or bank may charged. This will give the customers a chance to at least verify with their bank and card issuer as to how this type of transaction will be treated (in this case it was considered an advance) and the fees associated with it.\n\nInstead of reaching out, Wise just decided to cancel the card and credit the fee to the my Wise account. I prefer to have it credited back to my VISA. In addition, Wise should have at least let me make the decision to cancel or keep the Wise card.\n\nI reached out to my VISA issuer and they explained the foreign transaction fee. As part of their customer service, they later reversed the $10 foreign transaction fee. However, it is a MOOT point since WISE decided to cancel the card right away in the first place.\n------\nOriginal post.\nWe just ordered a Transferwise Card in preparation for our move overseas. We ordered a card as part of our back-up plan.\n\nI ordered the WISE card and one of the choices to pay was Apple pay so, I used my VISA card linked to my Apple Pay. Well, guess what!!!! Visa charged me a transaction fee of $10. I spoke to VISA and I was told that because the money was transferred to my WISE account, they considered it as an advance and therefore a transaction fee was applied.\nI am not sure why WISE has to transfer the funds to my WISE account. I was under the impression that I was just ordering or buying an item just like a normal purchase. There was no warning or disclosure about the transfer process and the possibility of fee VISA might charge. If there was, it was not very clear or obvious. The fee was more that the cost of the card. The cost to order the card was $9 and with the VISA transaction fee, it costs me $19 to order the WISE card.\n\nI started using WISE to transfer money this year (2023) and they were so far reliable. However, after having this Wise card experience, I am back to PLAN A, i.e., using Wells Fargo. I\'ve used WF since 2014 to transfer money and never had a single issue. Their fee is bit more and the exchange is slightly lower but at least WF disclose the fees. After having been BLINDSIDED with this small WISE transaction, how can you trust WISE again!!!!!', 'review_date': '2023-08-05', 'review_time': '16:27:40', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nAug 3, 2023\nHey Carol,\n\nWe're sorry to hear about your experience. Transparency is one of our main pillars. Please note that these extra charges aren't related to Wise, which is why we couldn't display them in the first place.\n\nEven though Apple Pay doesnâ€™t charge you any foreign transaction fees when you make a mobile payment using its service, if your card issuer or bank levies a foreign transaction fee, this will still apply. This means that there may still be a cost when you shop online or in person using Apple Pay.\n\nWe hope this clarifies, but please feel free to contact us at https://wi.se/contactus or on our social media platforms if you have further questions. Our support team will be happy to assist you.\n\nThanks for taking your time and giving us feedback.\n\nWise", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2023-08-03', 'CompanyReplyTime': '09:34:12'}
