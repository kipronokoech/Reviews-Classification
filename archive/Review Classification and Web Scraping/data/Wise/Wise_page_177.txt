When we close an account with money on it, we need to carry due diligence checks first. Once these checks are completed, we always get in touch about the refund.\n\nDue diligence checks are conducted to verify the information you have provided to us. We are required to do these at all stages of the customer relationship, not just during the initial onboarding stage, so this means during the customer relationship as well as during the deactivation stage.\n\nIf it has been longer than 60 working days, please reach us at https://wi.se/contactus_. Make sure to choose one of the options below “what’s your question about”, and you’ll see our numbers and contact form there.
