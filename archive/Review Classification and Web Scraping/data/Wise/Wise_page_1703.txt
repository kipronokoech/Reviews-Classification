And most importantly how they communicate that and treat people. As a company they took a stand in the conflict and were not so nice to the people who were affected by their decision. The customer service wasn‚Äôt nice either. It‚Äôs not always what you say and often how you say it.\n\nSecondly, some of the processes are far from being optimal. I sent the money via bank transfer to my wise account and for some reason they couldn‚Äôt identify it was me (even though it was a Swiss bank and most importantly the bank approved the transfer), they put everything on hold until i could download the payment confirmation from my bank, upload it to wise and someone manually verified it. I think it‚Äôs too much of a hassle for an online bank that is supposed to make my life easier. In addition to everything, while the transfer was on hold the exchange rate changed and i had to pay extra.\n\nOverall, i think it‚Äôs not worth it given the general company philosophy, the customer service and last but not lease the lack of ease of use compared, for example, to Revolut.', 'review_date': '2022-05-22', 'review_time': '17:42:47', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
