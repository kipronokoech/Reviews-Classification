However, the card worked less well when I wanted to purchase items on the internet- the transaction would sometimes time out and it wasn't always clear if it went through- in one case it didn't and it took me about a week to have the money credit to the account and in another case it did go through but showed up as a failed transaction.", 'review_date': '2022-10-10', 'review_time': '15:30:33', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
