That went OK, but the next morning when I logged in to send her money, my login failed with "Error - Incorrect phone number" or somesuch (it\'s now a different message after trying all morning to make progress :"Your user or phone number has been blocked from sending messages. If you believe this is a mistake, please contact us.").\n\nPerhaps the login code didn\'t like the hyphen I have in my email address, and mistook it for a phone number.\n\nI tried to use the web page to email someone about my problems, but upon submission, I got an error message saying it was unable to process the request.\n\nI then installed the Android app and tried again, with the same result.\n\nI then tried to register with my Google email, and made some progress, but had a real struggle putting in the recipient\'s address, since it insisted on using my contact list and putting in the wrong address. I wound up having to delete my contact and re-enter it so I make progress.\n\nThen, just when I thought it would go through, it informed me there was an account registered and I would have to go into that and change my email address if I wanted to use this one.\n\nI then tried to call the 888-870-2221 number, option 2, and it just rang and rang and rang and rang and....\n\nForget it. I will use another method of getting money to my sister. And I will never, EVER, recommend this pile of excretory code to anyone. EVER.
