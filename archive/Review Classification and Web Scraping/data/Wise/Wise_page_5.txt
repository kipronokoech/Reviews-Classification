However, when I contacted customer service to inquire about the status of my transfer, I was told that the money has been lost during the transfer and they need up to 45 days to trace it. They also warned me that the trace may be unsuccessful and the case will be closed in that case.\n\nI have been trying to contact customer service again for several days, but my emails have gone unanswered.\n\nI would not recommend Wise to anyone.

Sent a better quality, a robot rejected that immediately, I sent them an email about it, then radio silence. No reply, no advice, nothing. Today the payment I badly needed to receive got rejected by Wise, for not being completely verified... Immediately uploaded another document (in spite of pristine quality of the previous one) and called them. Obviously the guy on the phone couldn\'t do a thing, as verification is another department. He actually said the problem was not the quality as I\'ve been told before, but the issuing authority.
