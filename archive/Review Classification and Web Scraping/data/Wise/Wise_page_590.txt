You removed the red notification from my home screen and said I was good to go. So my clients kept sending funds. So eventually, I got around 65K USD stuck, saying it's 'Receiving'. So I lost several clients of mine, and they also accused me in keeping their funds. You support team - well, they are basically useless. All they can do is escalate the issue. I don't need to say that this 'escalation' brought nothing for the last 4 days.\n\nWhat you could do, you could tell me you need to block the account while you're checking it - as Stripe does.
