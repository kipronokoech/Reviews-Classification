The latter step is at no extra cost, which is fantastic, and a market leader for these type of transactions since Brexit. The whole process happens in seconds, and it's easy to follow where it is up to. My only bug bear with Wise, is that I find it much easier to navigate the software via my computer, than my phone. I never seem to find the correct icon for setting up a new transfer via the app, and always get in a muddle.
