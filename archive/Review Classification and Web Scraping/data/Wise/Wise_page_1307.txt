Habe been trying to open a business account and problems after problems and the support & service is not existent. I started the process early July and now early August I still don't have everything up and running. Everything that should work easy and simple, is complicated and gets stuck and then someone has to review things at Wise end. And waiting for a response days after days. Since it's been weeks already decided to try Paysera instead and got both my personal and business account up and running with 36 hours. Don't waste your time with Wise, you won't get any wiser waiting for them to sort all the problems they create.", 'review_date': '2022-08-02', 'review_time': '14:48:21', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

That is fair enough because I know they have to do their AML checks.\n\nHowever, what is unacceptable is that they close their chat lines so that you can speak to someone in the verification department because they are busy and provide no other means of contact.\n\nMeanwhile, I have transfers pending ... so will have to waste time setting up an account with another exchange service provider as I have no confidence that the issue will be resolved in a timely manner.\n\nOther than that, the service is good.\n\nSo if you use them, make sure you have another provider as a standy-by and do not become overly reliant on their service lest you are suddenly left high and dry by their verification team with no ability to contact them.', 'review_date': '2022-08-02', 'review_time': '12:50:39', 'CompanyReply': 'Reply from Wise\nAug 4, 2022\nHello Martin,\n\nThanks for being in our family. While our goal is to complete all payments as fast as we can, we‚Äôre a regulated financial institution and as such, we need to carry extra checks on transfers from time to time. This is a routine procedure to help us ensure we‚Äôre keeping our platform safe for everyone using (including you) while complying with local regulations.\n\nDo keep in mind, we always make sure to update you along the way, and you‚Äôll know the status of your transfer at all times.\n\nWise', 'CompanyReplyDate': '2022-08-04', 'CompanyReplyTime': '13:59:30'}
