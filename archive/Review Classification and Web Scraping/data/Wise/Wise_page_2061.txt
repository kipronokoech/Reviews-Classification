More and more Wise's adding extra steps to send the money. Takes more and more time to walk through all steps.\n2. Overprotecting through requiring the user's mobile phone number which is unacceptable. And Wise, obviously, is not interesting in any improvements to keep user privacy on a high level without compromising security. Phone number is very sensitive data.\n3. Sending money to the host country in a different currency than in the host country simply doesn't work. Try to send USD to the Czech Republic. First, you need to send USD to the USA and then you'll get CZK? That's overcomplicated and increases time and price for the service.\n4. Unable to skip surveys. I don't want to fill out surveys as I don't believe in anything being sent and processed. There is no feedback from Wise afterward at all. You must understand that survey takes the user priceless time and there is nothing in return for the user.", 'review_date': '2022-03-12', 'review_time': '15:20:36', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nApr 11, 2022\nHello Cezary,\n\nFinancial safety is not something we would make any compromises.
