I had enough satisfaction at that time, hence re-registered to Wise. Sadly many things change with it, it is far more slow, expensive and unpredictable. They are slow, as a simple money transfer to another account might take days... Expensive as they're charging at least %1 on money conversions, subject to currency. Unpredictable as they could ask multiple documentations for their verification process. It is unknown what sort of document they require, they website keep saying 'Try again'.\nAll in all, whatever happes to this company they seem to be keen on loosing their customer base as satisfaction is plunging.\n\nI had requested their 'Wise Card' to be able to use my internations trips, but now too scared to rely on that when I am abroad.\n\nSo I will close my account and move on.
