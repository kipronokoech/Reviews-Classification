DO NOT EVER EVEB think of setting up an account with them, maybe only as a spare one like a sixth wheel or like ab app that wouldn‚Äôt even be on the main screen but maybe just exist on your phone in case your PROPER bank sort your issue out. I can not believe that EVERY UK BANK I have been with (TSB, nationwide, Lloyds, Barclays as well as Revolut) will ALWAYS be on your side in terms of fraud and theft committed on your account and you would always ALALWAYS be given Ôøºthe benefit of the doubt unless further investigation that would be performed later on proved otherwise. Wise just takes being taken advantage of and robbed to a whole different level. The thing that infuriated me was that a non native British, potentially an Americab or Gd knows where they hire their slave labour, sorry I meant customer representative in team (haha) had the CHEEK to tell me that the ¬£180 transferred to me by my CLIEnt‚Ä¶ because I was stupid enough to treat Wise as my main account (wish I knew better it that someone warned me) treat my Wise account as the one I accept my tutor fees on (Wise management lolreading it, stop nhxindxx tax return and personal matters and start putting your eggs in another basket ubecause it worked out for you with Skype (congratgs!)would be not surprised in the slightest if your little stupid fake stupid little vendor machine lmao doesn‚Äôt even make you money, it COSTS you to run jr, so basically wise is running on hope of the foolsü§£). I mean I have absolutely went furious when a non British English speaker is convinced she knows English laws very well and that they MUST BY MAAHhave the date of birth of the sender.. that comment is not only getting you right out of my Home Screen and my main bank is now nation wide, that comment by this very intellectual clued up moron from America WHICH RESULTED IN THE LOSS OF ¬£200 FOR MY TUTORING FEES (MY FEED) where I was naive enough the father of the student did indeed fill out his dare if birth as I received the notification from wise that those details xare necessary straight away. I trusted he has done it for couple days then the funds never cleared never cleared‚Ä¶ do you know what an amazing difficult AND AND WITH DIFFICULTIE-riddled journey the poor victimised man who robbed me went through was.

In the end, I used the Biller Code instead of the BSP and it worked finally - but I am still not confident, that it will work the next time. This is also due to the fact, that I could not get the details of the transfer operation after having carried out. Another annoying topic is the fact, tha the whole operation took 4 bank days, which is definitely too long - and in case that it fails, is very bad, because the next trial takes you another 4 days and then nearly two weeks are gone!', 'review_date': '2022-11-28', 'review_time': '11:04:58', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
