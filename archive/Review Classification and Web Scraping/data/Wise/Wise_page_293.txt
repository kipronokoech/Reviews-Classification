This bank's deceptive practices and disregard for customer satisfaction left me feeling frustrated, cheated, and deeply disappointed. Here's why you should steer clear of Wise Bank:\n\n1. Account Deactivation: Without any prior notice or valid reason, Wise Bank abruptly deactivated my account. This sudden move left me unable to access my funds, pay bills, or conduct any financial transactions. Such an arbitrary decision without any explanation is simply unacceptable.\n\n2. Fund Holds: To add insult to injury, Wise Bank also placed a hold on my funds, effectively freezing my hard-earned money. They provided no legitimate justification for this action, leaving me in a state of financial limbo. It is unfair and unprofessional for a bank to hold a customer's money without valid cause or proper communication.\n\n3. Lack of Customer Support: When I attempted to contact Wise Bank's customer support to resolve these issues, I was met with utter frustration. Their support staff were unhelpful, unsympathetic, and showed a complete lack of urgency in addressing my concerns. It felt as though my problems were of no importance to them.\n\n4. Lack of Transparency: Wise Bank failed to provide any transparency regarding their policies or procedures. Their terms and conditions were convoluted, making it difficult to understand how they could justify their actions. A trustworthy bank should be open and clear about their policies, ensuring customers are well-informed.\n\n5. Unreliable Banking Services: The deactivation of my account and the subsequent fund hold were not isolated incidents. A quick search online revealed numerous similar complaints from other customers who had suffered the same fate at the hands of Wise Bank. It's clear that this bank has a pattern of engaging in deceptive practices, making it a highly unreliable institution.\n\nIn conclusion, I strongly advise against entrusting your hard-earned money with Wise Bank. Their untrustworthy practices, such as sudden account deactivation and fund holds, coupled with their lackluster customer support and transparency, make them an institution to avoid. There are many other banks out there that prioritize customer satisfaction and operate with integrity‚Äîdo yourself a favor and choose one of them instead.", 'review_date': '2023-05-26', 'review_time': '19:56:09', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nMay 29, 2023\nHi there,\n\nWe appreciate you taking the time to share your feedback with us, and we'd like to assure you that as a regulated financial institution, we don't scam anyone.
