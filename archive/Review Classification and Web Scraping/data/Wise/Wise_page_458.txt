At Wise, our customers are what matter the most.\n\nWe'd like to take a closer look at your transfer and help you out. Please note that we can only share transfer specifics with the account holder/sender of the transfer.

Offering a great customer experience is really important to us, and it's not our intention to fall short of that or to give you repetitive replies.\n\nFrom our understanding, it seems like your transfer was completed. We'd recommend forwarding your transfer receipt to your recipient, so they're able to share it with their bank to locate the sum. The receipt contains useful info that can be used by the bank to track the transfer. Here's how you can download the receipt from your Wise account: https://wi.se/getpdfreceipt_\n\nIf the recipient bank can't trace the payment, please get in touch with us via email again and we'll be able to advise on the next steps.\n\n- Wise", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2023-03-15', 'CompanyReplyTime': '01:22:59'}
