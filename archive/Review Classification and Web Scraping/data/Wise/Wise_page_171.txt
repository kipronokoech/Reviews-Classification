They asked for verification again, and said they could not verify my income, in spite of providing them proof. Great company turned crap. Leaving them permanently. Lucky I kept always small amounts on my balances. Be careful, don't move or keep big money with them. I read negative comments about them during the years, could never believe they were legit, it seems they were. Exactly the same happened to me like in those comments. All of a sudden they restrict you in spite of providing docs for verification. Same docs that are accepted everywhere else, even in brick and mortar banks. Be very careful with them, don't use them for storing big money or send and receive large sums. You may get stuck in the verification process and loose everything in a second.", 'review_date': '2023-07-21', 'review_time': '00:23:51', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nJul 21, 2023\nHi Bence,\n\nThanks for sharing your thoughts, and we appreciate you being a Wise user for 8 years!\n\nWe understand verification might seem like a hassle sometimes, but the safety of our customers and platform is our main priority. In some regions, we're required to verify the source of wealth, which means we need to see a document proving where your money comes from.\n\nDue to how we're regulated, we're really specific about the documents we accept, so please check this page for more info: https://wi.se/sow_. We know it might feel like a lot, but we're diligent and thorough because we want to keep everyone's funds secure.\n\nIf you can send us the supported document we need, we'll put all hands on deck to complete the checks and get your account back to normal in no time.\n\nIf you have any questions or need help, you can always reach out to us at https://wi.se/contactus_.

In that case, it seems like the correspondent bank has charged a fee, which we don't have control over.\n\nPlease keep in mind that some payment methods can be associated with higher fees. You’ll see how much each payment method or type of transfer costs when you set up your transfer.\n\nFor instance, SWIFT transfers can cost more, as the receiving bank and the banks involved in the process might charge their own fees.\n\nYou can check here for more info: https://wi.se/feesforsendingmoney\n\nWise", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2023-08-10', 'CompanyReplyTime': '10:58:54'}
