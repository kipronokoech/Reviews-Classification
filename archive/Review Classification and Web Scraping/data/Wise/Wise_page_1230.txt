Super good app. Super responsive customer service. Really transparent and not fleecing the customer like the banks have a habit of doing. It was all good until a transfer goes missing and you need some information as to where it actually is. Im pretty sure there were no issues with the actual transfer service performed by Wise (but I‚Äôve now tracked it down with the recipient bank) but the customer service was absent, with very long wait times and on post mortem seemed more intent on protecting themselves rather than just helping the customer out and providing information proactively when a customer has notified them through multiple contact channels that the transfer is missing and is clearly worried. I raised this customer service shortcoming with them and was really surprised how they didn‚Äôt deal with this nor acknowledge even that they fell short in this instance which is suxh a shame for a company with a great value proposition. I worry they are growing too fast and have lost a real differentiator in remembering how to treat their customers.', 'review_date': '2022-08-16', 'review_time': '10:56:31', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
