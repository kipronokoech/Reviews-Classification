Wise will suddenly put all your money on hold, and send you threatening emails, stating you have 7 days to provide documents (which are impossible to provide) or they will simply cancel your account and keep the money.\n\nThis has happened to me now twice. The first was 2 days prior to Christmas.... that was fun... spending time on your holiday trying to source documents to keep your account open and business alive.\n\nThe second has been just this week.\n\nWe had 2 customers pay us, Wise didn't put the money into our account, when we asked why, they responded with 'you need to re-verify your account, for the 3rd time'.\n\nThey take days and days to reply to you, even though they send you threatening emails stating all hell will break loose in 7-days.\n\nYou give them a call, to be told to call back at 8pm... guess what, you go to call at 8pm to find the number is 100% offline from 8pm, so there is no way to call.\n\nHonestly, Wise is great UNTIL (and mark my words... you will have an 'until moment', everyone does) until you have to deal with their customer support.\n\nSo here I am, for a second time, in limbo. Money in limbo.... customers money in limbo... we can't send the product to the customer because we haven't been paid... we can't refund them, because Wise is holding the money... we are just stuck.\n\nNo doubt, we will now receive poor reviews and chargebacks, simply because Wise has decided to play god.\n\nNow you may think reading this, that I am running some 'dodgy' 'shady' business... oh the opposite. You wait... it will happen to you, it happens to all of us.\n\nRead the other 1-star reviews, and just take a moment before proceeding, because you too will have your 'until' moment mentioned above.\n\nAnd for Wise.... instead of spending so much on a rebrand, how about you fix your internal processes and internal team, to actually be useful. Disappointing is an understatement.\n\n\nUPDATE: We are now just days away from it being 1 Month of no replies from Wise. You call them, to be told they can’t help and it has to be done over email.
