Whenever I've had questions, the FAQ/support page usually had detailed answers or I'd recieve prompt responses from customer reps. They've been great with communicating modest fee changes as well as service updates and continue to be upfront and transparent with the rates & fees when processing a transaction. This has become my preferred method of currency exchange transfers. The best thing I could say about the service is that though there might be other services with unique features and less expensive fees, I wouldn't know about them because I've never had a reason to look elsewhere.", 'review_date': '2020-11-15', 'review_time': '15:11:17', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
