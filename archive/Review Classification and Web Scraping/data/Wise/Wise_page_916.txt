They don't have your best interest.\n\nI used Wise for transfering money between accounts US - UK.\n\nAt first everything seemed alright, but after a while they managed - without my knowledge nor consent - to setup direct debits off those same transfer accounts going the other way.\n\nSo everytime I'll make a transfer deposit, a day or two later a small amount of moeny would go the other way.\n\nBut who would do something like that? Especially after having just made a transfer/deposit one way, and paid transfer fees. Send money back to where it came from? Only to pay more fees and exchange rates?\n\nThat has never happened to me before with another bank - mistakenly set up a direct deposit. Only happened with the bank that apparently had something to gain from such an action.\n\nIn another ocassion, I've noticed an online charge that I had not made, and almost had to fight with them for them to take action, and asked the vendor for my money.\n\nThese people are a complete mess.", 'review_date': '2022-10-15', 'review_time': '19:50:05', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

But it has been very inconvenient and annoying, because I have not found a direct way to contact Wise. They also told me in Wise that they had only received one transfer, but in reality there were 3.\n\nImprovements I suggest:\n* Make it easier to contact Wise support, putting an option in the menu of your website, to be able to report incidents easily.\n* Improve the way to access transaction history. It is not very intuitive, it seems that the wise website is not very ergonomic. (At least for me).\n* Improve the computer procedure for transfers so that dozens of repeated operations do not appear.', 'review_date': '2022-10-15', 'review_time': '17:54:07', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
