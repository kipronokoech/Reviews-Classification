With the majority of the transfers, it's already the case, however delays happen from time to time.\n\nDo keep in mind the estimate we give you while setting up the transfer can change depending on a few factors, such as the currencies you‚Äôre sending, when and how you are paying us. If we need more time to work on your payment, we'll update the estimate as well.\n\nYou can learn more about that here: https://wi.se/howlongdotransferstake_\n\nIf you need help with a specific transfer, you can always contact us here: https://wi.se/contactus_ or Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram with your email and user number. We will gladly review and provide you with the necessary assistance.\n\nWise", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2023-07-04', 'CompanyReplyTime': '07:15:18'}
