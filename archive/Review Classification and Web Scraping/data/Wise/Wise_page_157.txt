However, sometimes the receiving bank might take a bit longer to process the transaction. For example: for EUR transfers, it can take 1-2 working days before the money settles in the recipient's account. And it might take a little longer, depending on the specific currency.\n\nTo get more info, check out this article, and choose your desired currency: https://wi.se/currencieswesupport\n\nNow, if it's been longer than the estimated time frame, no worries! You can always download a transfer receipt from your Wise account and share it with your recipient. This receipt will assist their bank in locating the funds and get things moving in the right direction.
