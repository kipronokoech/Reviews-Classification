But as they have grown their customer support has suffered. I used to make transfer every day and even multiple times per day.

Further support people do not appear to be talking to each other. Some engineers have said they are aware of the problem and advised me to wait a few hours. Another engineer says “sometimes” and “wait”. So the person is guessing with no real facts. Then he says wait “about” four business days and try again. With other US banks there is no problem.
