I will be using them and occasionally try others but really just to compare as the rates I\'m getting are much much better.\nIf the likes like Currency Direct want to get customers they really need to stop been greedy and stop hiding behind terrible rates claiming they have no fees so they are cheaper.\nPeople can count or use a calculator.\nIt\'s not rocket science.\nThanks all for reading.', 'review_date': '2021-09-19', 'review_time': '07:13:42', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
