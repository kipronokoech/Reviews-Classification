So we transferred everything over to Transferwise, all our accounts, payments, direct debits...everything was going really well...until halfway through the first month all of our payments and direct debits got declined because we had reached a total payments limit of $50,000 /month - WHAT?! This was not made clear anywhere before this point (we had researched extensively). Contacted them and they said that\'s the way it is and they have no plans on changing it. So I would caution anyone considering switching bank accounts to Transferwise if you have payments over $50,000/month OR plan on growing your business if you\'re not there yet.
