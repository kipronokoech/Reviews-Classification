It helps us combat money laundering, and keep everyone’s money safe. That way we can continue to provide even faster, cheaper and more transparent service for you, for everyone.\n\nThat's not all – we also have different regional regulatory requirements. Which is why we might need to review your ID documents or ask more – or different – questions, depending on where you move money to or from, or where you live.\n\nSince each person is only allowed one Wise account, it can only be associated with one phone number. Even though you can only have one personal account, if you have multiple businesses that you'd like to have a Wise account for, you can add them all separately to your personal account.\n\nIf you're not receiving any notifications from us, please take a look here: https://wi.se/manage_notifications This will walk you through how to change your notification settings.\n\nIf you need help with anything else in particular, please feel free to reach out to us on our social media channels, or via phone and email here: https://wi.se/contactus We're more than happy to help however we can.\n\nWise", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2023-08-30', 'CompanyReplyTime': '22:51:38'}
