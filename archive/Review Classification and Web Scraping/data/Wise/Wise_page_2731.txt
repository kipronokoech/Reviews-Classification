Originally I joined to make cheap transfers to my son who had emigrated to New Zealand and thought the service (and costs!) couldn’t be improved. I would have recommended them to family/friends even without incentives as it’s so beneficial to use them.\nHowever they DO keep improving and adding new services and I now use them for all my travel cash/foreign transactions. So easy even when visiting different countries/using different currencies in the same trip such as Cyprus (Greek and Turkish) and the Holy Land (Israel/Jordan).\nI’m now also trialling the ability to hold funds in Stocks/Shares so money isn’t sitting idle - so far working well.\nHave never had any problem with any transaction - except that it keeps getting easier.\nThe one extra thing I can think of that I’d like is a Wise credit card - but I might start using their debit card in the UK anyway if the stocks/shares option continues to perform well.', 'review_date': '2021-10-04', 'review_time': '11:33:19', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
