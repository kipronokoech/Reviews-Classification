{'platform': 'Wise', 'id': '628217aae55124e5d9b62570', 'stars': 1, 'title': 'Beware', 'message': 'We had been a fully compliant and transparent business client of Wise for more than 3 years. We had transacted very frequently and also held funds with them in various currency accounts. Occasionally, and without any previous request of any documentation, etc. Wise would restrict our business account so we were unable to make use of the funds held in the various accounts.\n\nNow, they even closed our account without ANY NOTICE or even message. We were simply confronted with a message upon trying to login, that the account had been closed.\n\nSince their customer support is beyond pathetic as well, we have no clue why our account has been locked and why we can\'t even appeal to the decision that the account was closed. Apparently, support does not know why an account was locked and the compliants department does not answer these type of questions either - why would they...\n\nIn the meantime, our funds are inaccessible and we have to reuqest a transfer which can\'t even be split in various transactions and send out to multiple accounts.\n\nOur lawyers are currently looking into the issue since we suspect these actions are violating international banking laws and regulations.\n\nNo matter what strange reason Wise had to shut us off as a loyal customer, their terms and conditions should make anyone seriously question what kind of "challenger bank" or how "wise" they really are. Pretty much any normal day-to-day banking activity could potentially be considered as fraudulent or even criminal by them - which is why we can only warn anyone to not join these hypocrits.\n\nWhy hypocrits, you may ask. Well, Wise use blockchain and crypto technology to facilitate the transfers on their platform, hence the competitve cross-border pricing, yet they prohibit any user of their platform to engage in any transaction that may or even may not be blockchain/crypto related. We couldn\'t even use our funds on the accounts to invest in international shares or precious metals. Pretty futuristic and pro freedom, isn\'t it?\n\nBottom line, stay far away from Wise. They are worse than any traditional bank, even if they appear to be "better" at first glance.', 'review_date': '2022-05-16', 'review_time': '11:21:46', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

{'platform': 'Wise', 'id': '62821464e55124e5d9b62145', 'stars': 1, 'title': 'Security flaw and Wise fraud case', 'message': "I would warn anyone against trusting their money with Wise. I have recently lost £8000 as a result of two unauthorised and fraudulent transactions. The fraudster used the Wise official number and I received messages and calls claiming they are from the Wise Fraud team and\n\nSince both the SMS and the calls had the correct Wise caller ID where my two step authentication with Wise is linked to, there was no way for me to distinguish the fake messages from the authentic ones.\nThe moment I realised what happened, within half an hour of the transaction, I tried to contact Wise on all channels, but unsuccessfully. Wise has no one responding when a customer reports a transaction to be unauthorised. One has to watch in horror while their money is taken even when there is a chance for the money to be blocked in liaison with the bank (in this case Barclays) where the recipient transfers the funds.\nI contacted Barclays to put a block on the account where my money was gone, however, without Wise confirming the fraud case, the recipient bank cannot block anyone’s account.\nUnfortunately, Wise has done nothing despite having been informed in time about the fraudulent transfers and having full details of the recipients accounts.\n\nFor 4 days I did not receive anything from Wise, nor was able to talk to anyone on their fraud team. My report went through a ticketing system, same as any other type of customer complaint. No separate line or process in case of fraud.\n\nWhen I got an email after 4 days, I was simply asked to provide evidence which during the chat on the day, a customer service representative reassured me I would be asked immediately.\n\nIt took 4 days for Wise to come back to me with what looks like a standard email asking for more information.\nSince then, 9 days today, I have not heard anything back.\nNo response to my question on what type of action has been taken by Wise to recuperate the money that went to a Barclays account. When did Wise get in touch with Barclays?\nBy this time, I assume it is too late to block the recipient's account and get the money back. I’m sure the account does not exist anymore.\n\nWise promised on their chat, someone from the Fraud team will be in touch with me on the day, and even a simple customer ticket has a timeline of 2 days for response.\n\nUnlike other banks and trustworthy Fintech companies, Wise doesn’t currently have even any emergency channel to block fraud cases nor gives the impression they have a proper fraud team. For a team solely responsible to deal with fraud cases, 13 days is surely not an acceptable timeframe to remain silent, unsupportive and unengaged. No company would abandon their customers in an alarming and stressful situation like this.\n\nI have yet to hear what action, if any, has been taken to recuperate the money. The silence so far, gives me the impression that nothing has been done.\n\nI want to genuinely warn anyone against trusting their money to such a company that does not take their responsibility towards their customers seriously. I feel simply let down and would like to avoid anyone going through a similar experience. As for my case, it looks like I have no other option than to pursue it via the Financial Ombudsman service and issue a complaint.", 'review_date': '2022-05-16', 'review_time': '11:07:48', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
