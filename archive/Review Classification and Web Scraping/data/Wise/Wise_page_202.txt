This helps us keep your money and our platform safe. So depending on where you’re sending money from, and how much you send, we might need to ask you to upload some documents for verification.\n\nIf a document is rejected, it's mainly because it doesn't include the information we're asking for. That's why we might get back to you, asking for additional documents. We understand that this might be stressful, however, verifying your source of wealth is a regulatory requirement for us in some regions.\n\nSorry to hear your account was deactivated. This isn't something we take lightly. You can appeal our decision following the guidelines here: https://wi.se/accountdeactivation We’ll review your request and get back to you ASAP via email.\n\nAs for your remaining money in your account, we'll work on sending it back to you. But first, we need to carry out due diligence checks. While we do that, your money and information will be safe and secure.\n\nFeel free to contact us at https://wi.se/contactus or on our social media channels if you need assistance. Our support team will be happy to help. Thanks for sharing your feedback with us.\n\nWise", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2023-08-04', 'CompanyReplyTime': '08:09:19'}

This is to ensure that Wise is safe and secure for everyone on it.\n\nAs processing these checks is a legal requirement and therefore cannot be avoided, we have the following section in our Customer Agreement agreed by you upon opening of your Wise account: https://wise.com/terms-of-use\n\nVerification checks may increase the time for processing your transfer order, but the delay in verification could be because of multiple reasons i.e. customer support shared the wrong document.\n\nWe value our customers' time, but verification is something we never take lightly.

I have business account with them and the customer service is horrific. My clients have been trying to send me money but, for the last two months all of the incoming transfers are cancelled for no reason at all. The frustrating part of all of this is that Wise's customer support team tries their best to not help me out to solve the problem. They keep telling me that the problem is not caused by them but the sender is at fault. Following this comment from Wise, I talked to one of my senders to see if there is a problem on their end. However, to my shock, the sender took a screenshot and forwarded it to me. In the description box of the transaction it says that our account is either blocked or closed to receiving money. I immediately contacted Wise to get some info about this but they insisted to not give me a proper answer. They keep telling me to contact the sender which has nothing to with this. Just like a automated voice mail, I read the same thing over and over and over again. Instead of help they point the fingers at me, at the sender and probably anybody involved who is not from Wise.
