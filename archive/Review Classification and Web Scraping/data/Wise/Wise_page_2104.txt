LOL. Why the hell did you not state this before??\nNext, you start a chat/email session with Wise Support, the Wise support "sorry sir, we cannot expedite any transaction, but we have received your money and only can credit as per indicated 1-2 business days", which Im already aware, why do I need a customer service then.\nA customer service is a team which should either solve the problem by taking the customer request or escalate the issue to higher manager for priority based resolving.\nInstead if you state the same reason which is already known to a customer, what customer service do you have in place, it is just a stupid, dumb process "orchestrating the same is called a NUMB system".\n\nSo wise and his bunch of customer service always delay a transaction, that is for sure and no thanks to customer service, your transaction gets more delayed.', 'review_date': '2022-03-04', 'review_time': '12:45:01', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nMar 30, 2022\nHello there,\n\nWe aim to complete all transfers as fast as possible, but delays can happen for different reasons.

At first I thought the app and service was good. That is until something goes wrong. I made a transfer to my own account in Spain but the money was held for checks for 12 days with the excuse that it may be a sanctioned bank or a fraudulent transaction. Which it is Not. I provided photos of the actual bank, paperwork that showed it was indeed my account. Screenshots of the account and account details and much much more. NO REPLY. Over 10 days I made 4 phone calls to find out what was happening and on 4 occasions I was told by each member of the staff that they would call me back or that the money would be released that day or the day after. NO ONE EVER DID! Eventually after speaking to the FINANCIAL OMBUDSMAN the transfer was cancelled. Still no response to calls or emails. The customer service team are unknowledgeable, and without any ability to resolve the simplest of matters. They do not respond to any emails. If you ask to make a complaint they say that’s not possible and refuse to put you through to a senior person. This is against all Financial Services Authority Regulations.
