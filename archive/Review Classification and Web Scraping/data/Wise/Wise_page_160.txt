Recently upon checking the invoices, it came to light. It is a No Go and customer care team of Wise couldn’t provide any satisfactory reasons. It’s a mere time waste for me to talk to them. Very Poor customer service.\n\nAnswer to comment update from wise : I made this review after checking your email reply which was not satisfactory. It’s an open and shut case. Answer me please, “who changed my properly working address ? Time and date of change please.“ Your team has understood my question but still they are playing safe.\n\nWe will go back to basics :\nUntil 2021 it is showing correct address.\n\n1. Who changed my address in Quarter 1 2022. If it is me, then tell me the date and time.\n\n2. Having noticed this fault, I changed back only in June or so back to proper address. This date and time is confirmed by yourself. So this time change proof you have but you don’t have the time change proof of point 1.?\nCome on. This doesn’t sound logical.\n\n3. Question :\nWhy will I change back my correct address to a wrong address in first Quarter of 2022.\n\nSolution :\nYou told you can’t change the old invoices. Alright. Then kindly send me the official statement about this situation. You proposed this statement on July 15.\n“ I can however confirm that your correct and current address is BlaukXXXXX, 1X 5XXX3 LeXXXXXen despite what it shows on your statements.“\n\nHoping for an answer.', 'review_date': '2023-07-28', 'review_time': '09:22:19', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nJul 28, 2023\nHi Srivignesh,\n\nAs a regulated financial institution, we never manually change personal details on our end.
