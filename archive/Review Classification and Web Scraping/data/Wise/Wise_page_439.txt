And finally this did explain the situation and cleared up confusion on my side too. Wise still has its worth as an E bank, and I will keep using it.\n\nOld review:\nA good ebank, goes bad.\n\nUntil now it was good to use this service, but this month they introduced a shadow fee, that was never specified anywhere. So now if I top up another digital card from a wise debit card it takes 2% every time. Which is a horrendous very huge amount of money. The website has no information this, and the application says that on HUF currency this should not happen. But it happened to me this month twice, and I didn't get any explanation or help from the customer service either.

Unfortunately, markets have been more volatile recently, which makes it more expensive for us to buy and sell currencies — so we need to raise our fees to cover those costs.\n\nNo need to worry, we haven't forgotten our great mission to me free. We want to make it happen, and we work hard for it.\n\nWe continue to sustainably invest in our infrastructure, so you can move money faster and more conveniently. We need to reflect this in our price today, to help us bring down the cost of moving money in the future.\n\nFurthermore, we also explain this situation more thoroughly over at email, so kindly please refer back to it.\n\nWise", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2023-03-24', 'CompanyReplyTime': '12:23:37'}
