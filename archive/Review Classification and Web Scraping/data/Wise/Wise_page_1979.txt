If we do, we‚Äôll send you an email letting you know what we need. If we don‚Äôt hear from you in 2 working days, we‚Äôll automatically cancel and refund your transfer. So, every time you send a transfer with us, please keep an eye on your emails.\n\nHowever, we'd like to get more details on what happened and help you further.
