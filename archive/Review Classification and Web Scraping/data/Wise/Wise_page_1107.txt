We explain in more detail how our commissions work here: https://wi.se/ourfees_\n\nIf we're talking about a SWIFT transfer then the fees are higher for them, because it's an international transfer.\n\nHere's more info on fees on SWIFT transfers: https://wi.se/swiftpayments_\n\nIf you want to calculate the fees for your transfer to get the cost, you can use our virtual calculator: https://wi.se/pricecalculator_\n\nWise", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2022-09-13', 'CompanyReplyTime': '10:38:13'}
