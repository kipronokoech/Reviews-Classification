The process itself was quite OK, but we are now, more than a week later and the money has not arrived yet. First, I had to wire the money to an account in Belgium (they do not have an account in Luxembourg) and this took two days, then the money is blocked on their account. Customer service (two days waiting time to get an answer from a customer service rep based in the Philippines) is not useful at all. They are just telling me that documents that I sent need to be verified and that they forwarded the request to the responsible teams. Stay away from this service! Normal bank transfer would cost probably a bit more money, but, at least, you would get some service.', 'review_date': '2022-07-19', 'review_time': '15:34:27', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

I required an account in USD as well as a GBP account. I received an email from Wise on 14th June 2022 saying the business is verified. There after on July 6th sent me an email saying they need more details. They asked for same details prior to my business getting verified. I replied with the same answers I gave previously. I got a reply on 12th July saying they had sent my answers to the relevant team. It is 19th July I still haven't had an update. I am currently trying to transfer monies to another account. They have put the transfer on hold saying on the app that the transfer should go through by the 17th July. I have still not had any update from the company whatsoever. I have emailed them. I can't get through to them on the phone it cuts off after about 30mins of waiting. The online chat support which I had used previously has been taken off. The service from this company is absolutely atrocious. I made a grave mistake I should have stuck with a conventional high street bank or an online bank like Starling Bank. I am sure I wouldn't have experienced such bad service from them, I don't think its even possible even if they tried to.", 'review_date': '2022-07-19', 'review_time': '15:06:30', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
