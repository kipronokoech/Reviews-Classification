Paying for international invoices was much easier and cheaper than what we were used to and with the mastercard we had a payment facility that was easy to use and actually added comfort by sending notifications. Unfortunately today sending money through Wise is more expensive than using incumbent banks and the replaced the card with a wise card that can hardly be used in The Netherlands at all.
