{'platform': 'Wise', 'id': '61c2f9020430e828ebdb1fb5', 'stars': 1, 'title': 'Awful experience', 'message': "Let me start with that I had been a happy customer of (Transfer)Wise for more than 7 years. Until recently when I transferred a bigger amount to a car dealership as I was buying a second hand car. Immediately after sending the money to Wise I received an email saying that my transfer was paused as they require more information about it. I clarified that it was for purchasing a car, in the reference I even mentioned the type and the registration number, the recipient was a well established dealership so I though this couldn't be more obvious. They said the verification could take up to 4 days, so I waited. I was wrong. After waiting 4 days I saw that they still didn't send my money so I contacted customer support to check what's taking so long. The agent told me that they needed more information. I was quite shocked as I had already provided them the details and if they needed more they should have contacted me instead of just waiting for me to contact them. Anyway I clarified again the details and then the agent told me it takes another 1-4 days until they process it. It has been more than 6 days since I started the transfer and I'm still waiting for it to happen. I might actually lose the deposit I paid for the car as they are only willing to hold it for a few more days. In the meantime I wrote a complaint email to Wise which they say they would answer within a day. It has been almost 2 days and haven't heard from them. I had very good experience with them for many years, but this latest transfer and the way they handle it is more than disappointing. I will now have to look into the competitors to find a better alternative for future transfers, while I'm hoping that the current one will finally be resolved one way or another.", 'review_date': '2021-12-22', 'review_time': '10:08:02', 'CompanyReply': 'Reply from Wise\nFeb 3, 2022\nHello there,\n\nWhile our goal is to complete all payments as fast as we can, we’re a regulated financial institution and as such, we need to carry extra checks on transfers from time to time.
