I tried to send a measly 280 Euros to a marina in Europe to secure my berth for an upcoming trip. However, their artificial stupidity software (aka AI) seemed to have flagged it as shady. I was asked to give additional information before the money goes through. I immediately complied as this was a time-critical transfer. 5 days later, nothing has happened! Now, if a bank is unreliable it has no right of existence in my book. it is useless. The chat on the customer "support" page just tried to push it to anti-money-laundring laws. banks love to use this as a scape goat to divert attention from their own short comings. Utter nonsense.
