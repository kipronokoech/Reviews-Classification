It's important to bring out that we never use customer's money for our own benefit. We safeguard all our customer's money. This means by law, we have to keep all of your money in accounts that are completely separate from the ones we use to run our business. So, your money is backed by assets that we hold in separate accounts. These funds are called ‚Äòsafeguarded funds‚Äô. You can find more information here: https://wi.se/isitsafetokeepmoneyinwise\n\nWe looked into your case and seems that we have explained the situation in detail via email. We had reached out to you several times with no reaction. As a last resort we reached out to you on October 14th and explained that since we did not receive your refund account details for your USD account, we have had to reject the wire back to you. We also informed you the reason this happens, and we provided forward guidance on how to prevent this from occurring in the future.\n\nWise", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2022-10-26', 'CompanyReplyTime': '08:18:17'}
