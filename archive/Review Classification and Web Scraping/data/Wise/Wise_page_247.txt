The system does not notify you up front that you need to verify your IDENTIFICATION and the result no money was sent. And it took over a week since the process was begun to be notified that my transfer was canceled! The system led me to believe that my transfer was in progress and my party would receive the funds. Then, with no email notification (I had to check online) I saw a message that things were delayed getting money from my bank. Since there were plenty of funds in my bank, I was not concerned. Then, a few days later I received an email that I needed to verify my ID. Unfortunately the system required a selfie, but the camera could not be accessed. I know how to go to settings on my Iphone, but the app doesn't even show up on the camera access section.

Unfortunately, we can't always disclose the exact reason due to regulatory constraints. We know it can be frustrating, but please bear with us.\n\nIf you believe there has been a mistake, you have the option to appeal our decision. Just follow the guidelines provided at https://wi.se/accountdeactivation_. We'll review your request and reach out to you via email ASAP.\n\nRegarding the remaining funds in your account, rest assured that we're working on returning it to you. However, we need to conduct necessary due diligence checks for security purposes. Your money and personal information will be kept safe throughout this process.\n\nWise", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2023-06-14', 'CompanyReplyTime': '11:42:29'}
