It's not our intention to make you feel this way.\n\nWe understand the hassle of your card. At the moment, we don't offer tracking for standard delivery of our physical cards, so usually what we'd advise is to reorder the card again. However, we noted that it doesn't work for you as well, given that you've tried sending to 3 different addresses.\n\nWe would see like to help you get this sorted out and the alternative method is to send the card via DHL, our expedited delivery with a tracking number.
