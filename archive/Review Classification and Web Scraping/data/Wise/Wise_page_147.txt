It could be because the transfer was set up closer to the weekend/holidays, or because we needed to carry extra checks. You can read about it here: https://wi.se/howlongdotransferstake\n\nAs for the documents we've asked you to provide, verification is how we keep your business’s money safe, and comply with the financial regulations in the countries we operate in.

I gave my 16 year old daughter a virtual Wise card in my name (Wise said i could do this) when she went to Mexico to stay with a friend. The Wise card was rejected. Tried to sort it out, but all the options require phone contact on a specific number. Her Vodafone phone was turned off in Mexico due to a (nearly) £7 daily charge. Tried to change the phone number to my, but the system refused to do that even though I had authenticated myself with a photo/photo ID. My daughter felt really let down, luckily she had alternative sources of funds, including a debit card (which charges 2.75% though). Unfortunately when you contact them by email it takes a day to get a reply (although later emails are replied to faster) and then they asked me to phone - the link to the number essentially gave me a blank page with no numbers on it!
