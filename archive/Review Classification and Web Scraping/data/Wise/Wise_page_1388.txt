One added benefit is being able to have a debit card in another currency as I do for Europe, so I can make easy Euro payments when touring Europe.", 'review_date': '2022-07-19', 'review_time': '12:10:36', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

At first it was only to send money to my overseas friends and to use their virtual and physical card to make purchases when I am overseas.\nWise became so convenient that I eventually began to use for my daily expenses as well and also paid for certain subscriptions using Wise.\n\nTheir multi-currency and easy to use functionality was something unique alongside that, it supported a ton of countries and you can open a bank account for said currencies with a single click!\n\nI became so attached to the functionality that I decided to open a business account using Wise as well. This was when the trouble began.\nAfter opening a business account and paying $54 to upgrade it alongside providing all the documents required for opening the account, I waited for a whole week without any response.\nA few days later I decided to contact support, they ended up asking me for the same documents I provided almost 2 weeks ago and wanted me to provide more information about my business.\n\nMy business involves video game services, specifically video game accounts and boosting. The next day, I was informed that my business goes against their Acceptable Use Policy and they will not be able to support it.\n\nUnfortunate. However, that is alright, I figured I’ll just find another option. However, to my dismay, I was out with my friends for dinner and found out my Wise card was declined.\n\nI opened my Wise app and found out that Wise had not only deactivated my business account but my entire account including my personal account which I used for daily expenses.\n\nThat is completely unfair as I have not done anything that goes against the Wise policies. It is rather unjust for Wise to simply close my entire account simply because my business account isn’t supported. If my business isn’t supported by the Acceptable Use policy, simply close the business account, I have not used it at all and have not done anything on it. I also do not use my personal account for business.\n\nI contacted support immediately and asked why they deactivated my entire account instead of just my business one and they have not given a proper response, constantly avoiding giving me an answer and asking me to appeal.\n\nI have sent in an appeal asking for the reinstatement of my personal account however, I doubt Wise would approve it as I have read tons of articles of users getting deactivated and being unable to get their accounts back.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate: The support staff has resolved the issue by refunding me all the money and assisting me with creating a brand new account with all the same details. Absolutely amazing support staff and one of the best I have encountered by any banking provider', 'review_date': '2022-07-31', 'review_time': '05:20:12', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
