The story: I tried to transfer money to a friend in the USA, but ( so unfair) they took my money from my bankaccount and........ did nothing! When I contacted them they said they had to verify everything. They never send me a mail or something why they paused the transfer, I had to find out myself! The verifying was : making pictures of your ID and a selfie! So I did but had to find out myself again, that they don\'t accept a Dutch driver license as an ID. So I used my Dutch ID card. After a lot of attempts it was accepted but now I had to answer a question where my money came from and they wanted proof of my income!!!! I refused this because I think this whole thing went to far. So end of story is that day one, they took my money but after 1 week of annoyance my friend still hasnt received his money and I am frustrated the way Wise has "handled" my case. My new slogan is : be wise, don\'t use Wise', 'review_date': '2022-12-08', 'review_time': '09:57:30', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

I do wish the fees were more transparent upfront but when I\'m sending enough money for several months abroad I\'m not going to quibble over $4. I have to wire transfer from my home bank ($20) and then Transferwise has a nominal fee just to "accept" the wire transfer. Invariably I\'ll forget to calculate the fee into the total and I\'ll get a reminder email asking if I would like to lower my transfer amount by the fee amount so the transfer can be completed. All well and good unless the amount is specific to paying a certain bill or service. Then I have to cancel and start again which is a total pain. But really, that\'s maybe more on me since I do this only about once every ten to twelve months and it\'s just not a familiar process yet. I do find their customer service to be stellar - no matter how much I screw things up they figure a way to get the money safely transferred. When we were buying some property and the seller at the last minute wanted dollars instead of Euros, Wise was able to move the money into my Euro account and the deal was done quickly without a fuss, allowing us to close on time. Whew. I feel I can recommend them highly on customer service.
