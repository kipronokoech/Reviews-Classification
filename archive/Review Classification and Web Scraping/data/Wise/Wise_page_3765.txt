The first two transfers went fine, the third transfer remains in limbo 10 days later. I contacted the helpdesk and got a canned response about "security". They didn\'t say why the ID I used to open the account and make the earlier transfers now apparently wasn\'t good enough. I expect huge problems and a long wait getting my money back. Definitely not a service you want to rely on in an emergency.\n\nReplying to Transferwise - Thank you. The transfer did eventually go through, weeks late. But the long wait and the number of messages and resends of the same documents to get there does nothing to convince me Transferwise is a service to rely on.\n\nUpdated from 1* to 4* on 3 October 2023 after using the service for some time: After a bad start, my experience with Wise has been excellent and trouble free. The card is especially useful when buying online from overseas businesses, as provided I have a balance in the local currency I can pay using it. The fees are lower than comparable services. I\'m now happy to recommend it. But unless your ID documentation is immaculate with no name changes (my issues I suspect were due to some documents still being in my single name and some in my married name) or frequent house moves to complicate things, expect difficulties opening an account.', 'review_date': '2023-10-03', 'review_time': '13:48:28', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nDec 24, 2020\nHi Jane.\n\nThanks for your message.\n\nIf you still need help, give us a call or send us an email: https://wi.se/contactus_.
