It's normally a result of a conflict with our Terms of Service or Customer Agreement, or due to a discrepancy with a financial law.\n\nWhen we deactivate your account, we cancel all pending payments. We’ll work on returning any money that you’ve already sent the way we received it.\n\nTo know more about what to do if your account was deactivated and appeal our decision check here: https://wi.se/accountdeactivation_\n\nBest regards,\nWise Team", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2021-06-01', 'CompanyReplyTime': '10:45:39'}
