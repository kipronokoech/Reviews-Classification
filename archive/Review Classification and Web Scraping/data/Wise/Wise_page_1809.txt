Your backoffice. We had several instance where we had a problem not for a few hours or a day but for up to TWO WEEKS! I mean, you are in BANKING business! Examples:\n- In 2020 we our first payment for 50 or 75k from a client which is an US-based unicorn, very well known and founded by Silicon Valley veterans. Still, it took you almost a week (and me around 5 hours on the phone and writing emails) to get the payment unblocked and reason acc. to your support was "high workload in backoffice processing"\n- 2 or 3 months ago, after a new EU directive in place, we had to confirm sth. or upload data. We did but then it took you AGAIN several days to release our account - in the meantime, several Veem debits (to team members in Colombia which we cannot pay via Wise strangely enough) were rejected, several times. Then Veem froze our account and until today we cannot use it anymore. Veem requires a Letter Of Good Standing from our bank, you/Wise, which you/wise refuse to write, despite our regular payments from our clients.\n- A payment stuck and even not possible to remove a few days ago, if I hadn\'t actively emailed/contacted you, nothing would have happenend - again, your KYC/AML dpt. overwhelmed\n\nAll of that led to us not being able to pay the remuneration to our team members/freelancers and afterwards a reputational damage of us as an employer.
