However... I held a reasonably significant USD balance, so, when I received email marketing promising an interest rate on USD bslances I folllowed the invitation and converted my USD account to an "interest" account. Months later, only fees had been debited from the account. I contacted customer services who revealed this offer wasn\'t available to UK residents! So they (Wise) invited me, and allowed me to sign up for this type of account. I only would have found out about this had I contacted them. My other complaint(s) are related to the debit card offer. Wish I hadn\'t activated that. It was always getting declined anyway but the real kicker was the occasional fraudulent charges from Australia and Hong Kong. There was a charge to a debit card I\'d cancelled / don\'t have - leaving me needing to check my accounts on a regular basis purely to check I\'m not being defrauded.', 'review_date': '2023-02-04', 'review_time': '15:20:36', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
