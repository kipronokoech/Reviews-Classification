They send me emails indicating that I have to provide more info. After logging in I could see that my transfer is being held up until I ‘fix’ something. So I click on the Fix it link only to discover that they expect me to be able to provide complete info for my friend’s bank account, such as account number, routing number, etc. I don’t know any of this extremely confidential info - it’s my friend’s account, and according to their own web page it’s marked private. This is very unsettling - they expect YOU to have ALL THE PRIVATE BANK ACCOUNT INFO for your recipient’s account!! This makes no sense - my friend already established a legitimate account on wise.com, including all required bank account info, so I fully expected to simply click on her account and direct the funds to her. But no, that would be too simple. Seriously, do you know the confidential bank account info of your friends?\nUPDATE: The company's response simply reinforces the absurdity of their approach. Paypal doesn't require you to know the confidential financial data of your recipients, nor does CashApp; instead, you simply select the desired recipient (with the implicit understanding that it's your responsibility to select the right recipient) without knowing anything about their bank account. Somehow wise.com is incapable of providing similar functionality, pretending that it simply can't be done.\nStay away from wise.com!!!", 'review_date': '2022-06-15', 'review_time': '21:46:21', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nJun 15, 2022\nHi Kevin,\n\nCompletely understand your concerns, but we do need bank account details in order to know where to send the money.

It's the same as you'd set up a payment with your bank - you need to verify yourself as well as provide more details in order to make payments.\n\nHope you can understand that, but do reach out to us: https://wi.se/contactus_ if you need more information.\n\nWise team", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2022-06-15', 'CompanyReplyTime': '11:29:19'}
