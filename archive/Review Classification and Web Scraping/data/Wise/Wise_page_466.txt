Note that the speed can depend on the currencies involved, the payment method used, and any bank holidays or weekends. Due to the weekends, payments sent during this timeframe will usually be processed by your bank on the next working day, which is Monday. In case it's taking longer to reach, we'd suggest downloading a transfer receipt, which has all the info your bank needs to trace and process the payment faster. Here's how you can get the receipt: https://wi.se/getpdfreceipt_\n\n- Wise", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2023-03-07', 'CompanyReplyTime': '01:55:09'}
