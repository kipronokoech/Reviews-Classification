I\'ve had my WISE account for a few years now and had all security checks done and it has also been fully verified.I\'ve done small transactions before through it and hence had already all my personal details stored from my other banks PERSONAL accounts from which i usually send money into my Wise account.\nSo yesterday Wise froze that last transfer leaving me completely panicking about the status of the transfer. All I could see that they need to run more checks but this checks could take up to 10 working days to be done.Imagine my shock after seeing this?Mind you my details were there stored already and they didn\'t need to withhold my money as the recipient was myself! I was simply transferring my own MONEY onto my other personal bank account!! I phoned to the Customer Service this morning and had the most clueless and unhelpful customer service operator. She couldn’t give any clear response and just kept mumbling about that it would take time to complete those checks! ! The excuse was "Wise is financially regulated organisation therefore it needs to conduct a few more checks".\nThe worst part when I asked for a manager to be put on the phone she initially claimed that they don\'t have a relevant department ,then she changed her story to that they had managers BUT conveniently they were all busy with other customers and simply said to call back when they\'re free ! Seriously ?! Then i asked to file a complaint against Wise for which she said she\'d send me an email for that after the call. You can guess it there were NO email from Wise after the call.\n\nJust a few mins ago I finally received my money but that\'s not the point. A reputable business like Wise claiming to be MUST NOT treat its customers this way!\nIf you think to use Wise services to handle you money do it at your own risk!\nTHERE\'S NO CUSTOMER ASSISTANCE AND YOU WILL BE LEFT ON YOUR OWN!\nI am closing my account with this joke of a company!\nYOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!', 'review_date': '2023-10-20', 'review_time': '13:40:00', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

At first, things were good, but in the last 6-12 months it went really downhill. Customer support is slow and they never really solve anything anyway.\n\nWise also wants you to do verifications all the time (we are a legit online store and we do not sell anything "problematic") so we always sent them the requested documents etc. Yesterday they asked for another round of verifications - again we provided them bank statements and everything else. We got confirmation that everything was sent okay so we went and set up several business transfers & we sent money from our bank to Wise..... only to find out that Wise will keep our money for a week because they are still "checking the verifications" - even though the system previously said everything is okay and let us set up the transfers and send money to them. Completely unprofessional.\n\nI would understand them needing time to finish the verification, the problem is they let us set up those transfers and transfer money to them. Before we completed the verification (or at least we thought we did, according to what the system said), we were not able to set up those transfers. That\'s why I am so angry.\n\nNow we are trying to reach customer support - unsuccessfully. Chat is not available, they always push for you to call them. No problem, we called. I am already waiting for more than 30 minutes to be put through and still nothing.
