I complained but got no response. Suddenly the negative balance from my account was removed. I thought my complaint was successful and asked for confirmation. Still no response.\n\nAnd then last week, when I paid in some money to make another transfer, Wise withdrew my money without asking and told me after.

In June 2023 I decided to close my accounts with Lloyds Bank and transfer all my balances to Wise and use them as my bank instead. I did all the transfers in small amounts as I did not want a large transfer to go missing. All these incoming transfers were accepted with no questions asked??? Then on 15th August 2023 I tried to transfer some money and make a payment. These were both cancelled and I was told that Wise needed to verify my income. This is where the problems started. Wise requested 3 months statements from the accounts that I had transferred the funds from. As I did not receive paper statements and just downloaded the statements to Excel and had already closed these accounts I had to write to Lloyds for the statements. They required an original signature for this and refused to email the statements to me so it all had to be done by ordinary post.\nAll this time my account is frozen and I can\'t pay accounts or transfer any money. Very stressful indeed. After sending these documents Wise then requested rental agreements to prove where my income came from, which I duly sent to them. I still kept getting a message on the app saying "We could not verify your account from the documents you have sent, try again". Very frustrating as there is no further information as to what is wrong with the documents.\nI eventually managed to get through to the call centre and spoke to a very helpful lady ( Luna Belle ) who explained that I have to send all the documents required at once as the previous ones that I sent would not be saved?? After realising what the problem was I uploaded all the documents in one go but it still took a further four days for Wise to unblock my account. I was locked out of my account from 15th August to 22nd Sept 2023.\nWise is great when all is working well, BUT when there is a problem their support is dismal. When you realise that the only communication with your bank is by email and they take between 2 and 4 days to reply you know that you have a big problem.\nI have lost all faith in Internet Banks and will stick to a real bank that I can phone or even visit the branch if need be even if they charge me more. The choice is yours but you have been warned.\nWise will most probably post up their usual reply saying that as they are a regulated bank blah blah blah but when you can\'t get hold of your own money it is frightening.', 'review_date': '2023-10-27', 'review_time': '18:33:11', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
