I bank with Nat West, and my first, online payment attempt was suspended. Despite twice confirming to Nat Westâ€™s Fraud Prevention team that the payment was legitimate and approved by me, they proceeded to freeze my bank accounts for 48hrs. Nothing to do with Wise, just overzealous and poorly trained Nat West customer advisors.
