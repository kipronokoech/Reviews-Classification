The money was needed for rent and utilities and I was getting very stressed as it was not clear and still isnâ€™t clear why I couldnâ€™t. As you now say, it is now possible. I simply cannot trust you so will use another method from now on as I just cannot rely on you for your service.

If it has been 5 days since your order, it is still within its delivery time. Please also keep in mind, many post offices are still taking extra safety measures due Covid and this is causing delays.\n\nThe 20 GBP top up is one of the requirements for getting bank account details with us.
