It also has not come. The customer service advice? Wait more days. I have explained that I have waited over a month. I have ordered two cards that have not come.\n\nThen they assume that I live somewhere where the stores take digital wallets, so they say use the digital version. Also completely assuming I have enough data on my plan to do so. I do not. And I don\'t believe the store I shop for food has digital wallet capabilities.\n\nSo I am now out of money and almost out of food. I have no way to buy any more food because Wise is holding my money hostage. I\'ve been told that, even though I will most likely have to order the card a third time, they "cannot do priority". Which is bull. You can certainly pick up a phone and make adjustments to my delivery (at your expense).\n\nMy advice? Go with a different online bank as Wise does not track your cards and will tell you they can\'t, even though it\'s a simple revisement of their agreement with the post office - they simply do not wish to spend the additional money it would cost to ensure their customers peace of mind about their cards.', 'review_date': '2021-07-06', 'review_time': '11:18:47', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nJul 14, 2021\nHello, Shea!\nYou would be correct in that we currently aren't able to offer tracking options for our packages, although it's certainly something we'd be happy to take a closer look at for the future.

If I should judge from my own experience, Wise could do well by providing a little training in communication to all staff that answers telephone calls. If the last person I talked to could see everything I did on the screen and patiently explained the steps to do - why could the other persons I talked to not do the same?
