Huge mistake.\n\nI opened a US dollar balance with them. It is so incredibly confusing to use. There are different details for payers inside and outside the US, and then a few months ago they actually changed all the account details to an entirely new set of details! So there are now FOUR potential sets of US bank details to choose from.\n\nI am currently trying to receive a payment from a corporate client. Between dealing with them and Transferwise it has been a total nightmare. The client sent a transfer using the bank details I gave them, and it actually BOUNCED. I contacted Transferwise, and they sent me a letter saying "Just have your client contact their bank, they need to update their database".\n\nYeah, just contact my incredibly bureaucratic, disorganized, and uncooperative corporate client and get them to actually put in the effort to sit on the phone with their bank, all because Transferwise decided to mess around with everyone\'s bank details? So easy!\n\nI now have to wait months to receive payment for my work due to Transferwise\'s "cool new changes"! Thanks guys.\n\nFinancial services isn\'t an industry where you can "move fast and break things". Even seemingly small changes can have big consequences for customers. Transferwise should stop playing around with people\'s bank details, stop fiddling around with their company name and branding, and instead focus on providing a consistent service and doing it properly.', 'review_date': '2021-03-25', 'review_time': '10:50:13', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nApr 6, 2021\nThanks for sharing your feedback with us, Chloe.\n\nWhile we appreciate all types of feedback, it's important for us to add this wasn't a rushed decided, not a decision taken lightly as well.\n\nThis change happened because we wanted to reach more markets and because of that we needed to chance partner banks.
