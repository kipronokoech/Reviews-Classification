But two transfers for the total amount of $10k AUD I couldn’t.\n\nFirst of all, I didn't have an accountant with Thai currency.\n\nSecond, I called Wise Australia immediately after I saw notifications on my phone about transfers I didn't authorise.\n\nI also saw the information under made transfers that it would take up to 2 working days to deliver money. And it was Friday afternoon!\n\nUsually, when I transfer money from my Wise Polish account to someone new, it takes 2-3 days to deliver. And suddenly, Wise Australia is not able to stop the transfer a few minutes after someone sent them.\n\nParmeet from Wise Australia didn't even try to help stopping these two transfers! He just sent me an email with the article about the fraud. I answered Parmeet's email and never heard from him back!\n\nSo I called Wise UK, and Paul was trying to pause these two transfers! But it was already almost 9 hours after someone hacked my account! Paul even deactivated my account to make sure it won't happen again.\n\nMy question is, why Parmeet didn't do any of that??\n\nSince that moment, 24 Sep, I have been calling Wise (Australia and UK) for two weeks almost every day, to get any information about my hacked account.\nNo one was able to tell me what was the status of my case or if Wise actually contacted that Thai bank to stop the transfers. I requested to receive all transfers' details so I can contact Thai bank with my layers. I never received this information.\n\nThe Customer Support Representative only asked me not to call Wise and just wait for the email.\nWhat is that supposed to mean??? I am sure they have insurance for situations like this and they didn’t take any actions to help me get my money back!\n\nIt seems that Wise is not securing customers enough to prevent situations like this! And Wise Australia at that moment didn't do anything to help me!\n\nThey are not replying to emails, they are not providing any information via phone, they asked me not to call them and communicate only via email, they don’t provide any support to their customers!!", 'review_date': '2021-10-16', 'review_time': '01:47:14', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nNov 3, 2021\nHello, Marianna.\n\nWe understand this situation is very frustrating, but rest assured we did everything from our side, so that doesn't happen again.\n\nSince you got in touch with us, that means we're carrying investigating from our side, and we'll get in touch with you as soon as possible.
