The companies I work for use different money transfer companies to provide payment. By far, wise is the worst. They hold your money for as many business days as they like without providing a reason. You call their customer service line and you have to wait at least 30 minutes to talk to an agent that has no desire to help in any way. You just get a "we can\'t disclose that information" both to the sender and the one receiving the transfer. They send a transfer number that never exists according to their webpage. You get the runaround until you either get your money or you get frustrated. I strongly recommend not to use this company unless you love to be put on hold, get to talk to the least empathetic reps in the nation, and have no need for money.', 'review_date': '2022-08-23', 'review_time': '23:23:18', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
