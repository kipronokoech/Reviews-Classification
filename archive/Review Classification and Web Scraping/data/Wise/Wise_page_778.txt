Money finally back to my own account. Issue was because Wise sent the money then a recall request and somehow communication between banks were lost....\nUPDATE 24 Nov 2022 (almost 4 month since the transfer): The beneficiary bank is saying they are not crediting the money as Wise requested a recall asking to send back instructions to credit it. Wise is saying the recall is cancelled and there is nothing they can do, asking me to deal with the beneficiary bank. Worsen the experience even more. What a "glitch"?!!\n\nORIGINAL POST: Worst experience I ever had. I been using wise for a while to transfer money to my family. My latest transfer was done in August. Till today issue still ongoing. It took me 1 month to convince them that the money didn\'t arrive till they discovered there is a problem was a problem with their partner bank. 2 month later they kept sending false updates the last was one week ago say "money is with the beneficiary bank TWO MONTH ago you can check with them" Till today the money didn\'t arrive. Even after escalating to their complaints team, there is no progress. In fact, they also acted in a very careless way. Adding that for every update I received I had to follow up by email/phone multiple times. In the end no matter how easy the app is to use they are definitely not actual bank and when there is a problem their bar is very low.', 'review_date': '2022-12-25', 'review_time': '19:26:35', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nNov 16, 2022\nHello,\n\nWe're sorry to hear about the situation you're in.
