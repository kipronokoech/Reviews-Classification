Who pays for the amount of money and time I have lost due to Wise depriving me of my money this long?\n\nThey freeze your account for no reason, tell you to submit an appeal over your funds which takes at least 60 days. After the appeal, when they officially close your account, they tell you to wait another minimum of 60 days for due diligence before they will inform you what will happen to your funds. How can Wise still be allowed to operate under these terms? Besides, no where are these number of days stated in their terms and conditions! This is gross consumer exploitation!!! Once you deposit into Wise, know that you have no control over your money and you could lose it for good!\n\nCustomer service is the worst I have seen in the financial world! It's people's money you are dealing with for crying out loud!!! Try to respond in a timely manner! It takes them months to respond to messages and they provide only generic answers when they do respond!
