However due to some unknown reasons, TransferWise was unable to process the funds even after 1 week, till 20th Sept 2021. Therefore I requested them to Cancel this transaction & refund the money back to my NZ account, which they claimed on 20th Sept 2021 that you will be receiving your funds back in 1-3 working days.\n\nHowever, he amount of NZD $1920 is still pending on TransferWise Ltd. They claim that they have refunded the money from their local partner bank account (in the name of JP Morgan Chase Ltd. NA). TransferWise still manipulating the REFUND so far and not proceeded till yet, this has been confirmed by their two members of Customer service support staff during phone conversation on 23rd & 24th Sept 2021. Moreover, NZ Bank says if they have REFUNDED on 20th September 2021 through their local partner NZ bank the money should arrive in a maximum duration of 0-1 days, a normal banking transfer duration in New Zealand.\n\nThey have just shared a computer generated document not a bank statement or screen shot of their bank statement to show proof of their refund transaction. I have requested them to share proof of refund transaction but they were unable to provide one, which means they are lying. Even after several emails and phone calls, no staff is unable to provide information about the actual date / duration for this refund.\n*Wise claims to refund the money in 1-3 working days in their mails, app status. Now they are saying it takes 5-10 working days. Also I am not counting weekend. They have bunch of staff that all says different things over the phone when u ask about your refund duration. In one email they advised me to contact my local bank, however they were lying and again diverted me in wrong information, (trace the money ??) b'cos transfer didn't happened during the whole week from 20th September. They expect customer to keep running from post to post, and they don't have any value of customer's time.\n\nIn other words TransferWise Ltd. is trying to mislead, holding up people's money for their own interests and intentionally without any reason. It's been 13 days my money is in their accounts for no reason.\nHighly incompetent, inefficient with poor customer service team. Would not recommend to use Money Transfer, be careful in dealing with them.\n\nThanks", 'review_date': '2021-10-11', 'review_time': '18:01:35', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nOct 11, 2021\nHello there,\n\nWhen a transfer is cancelled, the refund is issued and processed by us right away. Still, depending on the payment method you've used, it can take 5 - 10 working days for the money to reach your account. You can't count weekends or holidays.\n\nThe PDF receipt we provide, contains all the necessary information your bank needs to trace the money from their side.\n\nWise.", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2021-10-11', 'CompanyReplyTime': '11:55:35'}
