I have nearly 10 hours on the phone to 7 different reps over the last two weeks, all to try to get "verified" after 6 years of using Wise, formerly TransferWise. The reps are all very polite and patient. But they are trained to only spout what appears in the reply from Wise below, not to actually address problems. 100 percent of the time so far, a computer-generated email contradicts what the rep just told me. It is not electronically possible to reply to an email from Wise. In order to generate an email to Wise from the site, you must dig 6 links deep, and guess at the correct answer to a question to get to the next link. When Wise tells you, "You can email us," it is technically correct, if you can find their hoops to jump through. Clearly, that is deliberately designed. But I doubt if anyone reads them. I have sent 10, not ranting, simply stating the problem and progress (lack of) so far, and gotten not one reply. It is impossible to speak to the same rep twice. Reps are not permitted to call back--and not permitted to tell you they are not permitted. Of the 7 reps, #5 actually told me what the holdup in my process was: "Our team" has not yet gotten around to looking at the 3rd of 3 documents required to be submitted to prove I am who I say I am, after 6 years. It has now been 7 days since I sent the foto, still waiting for the "team" to get around to it. They did, however, approve the first two, according to rep #5P. I have at least a dozen computer emails telling me my docs have been "confirmed," from the 10 times I have sent the 3 images that MUST be taken in real time with a mobile phone--id, selfie, and selfie holding id. But in bot language, "confirmed" means "confirm receipt," not "seen and approved by a human being." Two of 3 have been approved according to rep #5. Rep #6 was the worst, almost a joke; #7 yesterday said they would try to find out the problem (unable to confirm what #5 told me 4 days ago), and send me an email when she found out.
