Previously if you set up a new recipient account and wanted to make a test transaction (eg 1 USD) they would say "sure" and remove the transfer fee.

A US bank is about to send me *two* < 1 USD transactions to test my WISE account. They are paying their *own* money to do the right thing. Wise could learn from this.
