We understand how this could be frustrating, so we'd like to shed some light into it.\n\nAs a regulated financial institution, the verification process is crucial to us. It helps us combat money laundering, and keep everyoneâ€™s money safe.\n\nWe understand it might seem lengthy, and usually, we get this done within 2 â€“ 4 working days, but in some rare cases, we may need a little more time if there's extra information needed. Rest assured, we'll always keep you in the loop if that happens.\n\nThis is a very important step for us, and because of that weâ€™re very diligent with this process. Speed is our priority, but so is keeping your money and our platform safe, as well as complying with regulatory requirements.\n\nIf you ever need help or have questions, don't hesitate to reach out to us at https://wi.se/contactus_, or hit us up on Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram with your email and user number. We're here for you.\n\nWise", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2023-07-20', 'CompanyReplyTime': '12:44:59'}
