Then after several more days I recieved a message that my funds were being refunded with no explaination. I called customer service and they said my money was being returned because they need a copy of my ID to confirm my idenity. I did that when I set up the account and made previous transfers!!! They said an email would have been sent asking for the ID. I was not sent an email and their rep confirmed that. Said they must have made a mistake, but they would still need ID and that an 'actual' person needed to review the ID and it would take a week!!!!! Now waiting 1-3 days to get my funds back.
