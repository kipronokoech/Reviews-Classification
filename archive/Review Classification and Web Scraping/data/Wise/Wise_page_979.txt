We explain how long transfers usually take here: https://wi.se/howlongdoesatransfertakes_ but as soon as the money hits our system, we'll notify you via email/app, so do keep an eye there.\n\nWise team.", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2022-10-05', 'CompanyReplyTime': '11:01:40'}

I had bank info in English and foreign language.\nHere's the most ridiculous failed transaction. One of my recipients is actually a Wise customer and Wise suggested depositing the money in the account on file with Wise. I though great, there's no way this can fail. Wrong again. Wise automatically set up the recipient's bank info and then when I tried to send money it told me the transaction failed for lack of recipient's address.
