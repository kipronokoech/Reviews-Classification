The fees are great, but support and the information they provide are weak. I had numerous of times when I sent payments, they didn't reach out the recipient and just stuck in a system. You cannot know about this - no notification message. You just wait, be worried, write tons of Emails and eventually either money sent back to you or support finds them. It is not clear where the money is - you need to ask support and wait for 15-30 minutes until support actually answer you via the phone.\n\nMy latest experience - they just blocked/deactivated my profile. My business operations blocked. No explanation why this happened. I have invoices/contracts that can support all my payments. You can appeal to Wise but it is up to 20 business days that they can answer to you. This is sooo long. And I cannot do anything with my money and I was told that probably my account won't be restored even after they reply me.\n\nSo frustrating. You cannot rely on this service on the long run.
