The process of transferring money overseas can often be a hassle, but Wise.com makes it a breeze.\n\nOne of the things I appreciate the most about Wise.com is the competitive exchange rates they offer. I've used other providers in the past, but the rates offered by Wise.com are some of the best I've seen. This is especially important for me as I frequently transfer money overseas for business purposes.\n\nAnother great feature of Wise.com is its ease of use. Their website and mobile app are user-friendly and the process of transferring money is simple and straightforward. I also appreciate the fact that they have a currency account and debit card option, which makes managing my overseas finances a lot more convenient.\n\nAdditionally, I have found their customer service to be top-notch. Any time I had a question or needed assistance, their support team was available and helpful.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend Wise.com to anyone looking for an affordable and efficient way to handle foreign exchange transactions. The combination of competitive exchange rates, ease of use, and great customer service make it a no-brainer.", 'review_date': '2023-01-18', 'review_time': '07:44:37', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

This isn't something we take lightly. It's normally a result of a conflict with our Terms of Service or Customer Agreement, or due to a discrepancy with a financial law. We can't share the exact reason of the deactivation, due to how we're regulated. However, you can find some possible reasons here wi.se/accountdeactivation.\n\nThank you for already appealing, our team will reach out to you once they have further updates regarding your account. Please keep in mind that this process might take up to 30 working days.\n\nAs for your remaining money in your account, we'll work on sending it back to you. But first, we need to carry out due diligence checks. While we do that, your money and information will be safe and secure.\n\nWe run these checks to verify the information you gave us. We need to do these at all stages of the customer relationship, not just in the onboarding stage — this means in the customer relationship stage, as well as the deactivation stage.\n\n\nWise", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2023-01-18', 'CompanyReplyTime': '09:00:35'}
