WISE is saying my money has been sent to the Thai agent and now the delay is in the coversion. No mention of security checks. So tell my why when you put in the transfer details, the transaction times have changed from "should be done in seconds" to over 24 hours)\nI am an Australian retiree living in Thailand. Every month, I have been using Transferwise (now called WISE) to transfer money from Australia to MY Thailand bank account. I have loved it, funds usually transferred in seconds (sometimes hours, I can live wit that). Today, the same transfer is going to take 2 days. It was supposed to be 8 hours, changed to 18 hours, now they say 2 days. I emailed them, got the BLAH BLAH BLAH email. I reply saying I have been using your service for years and you aren\'t addressing the points in my email. I get another BLAH BLAH BLAH email. I got onto their chat screen, got more BLAH BLAH BLAH. I last transferred money on 25th November, the service was great, transaction done in minutes, as normal. I will be looking for alternatives, their level of service has dropped alarmingly quickly.', 'review_date': '2021-12-02', 'review_time': '09:37:43', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nDec 2, 2021\nHello, Phil.\n\nIt's never our goal to delay payments, but delays can happen for different reasons. We don't have enough details from your review, but we could be carrying extra checks. While it seems you didn't like our update, this is the information we have to share. We are a regulated financial institution, and from time to time, extra checks will be carried on transfers. We hope that you don't look for alternatives, but this is a standard procedure that can't be skipped.\n\nOnce your payment is sent out, you'll be updated\n\nWise.", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2021-12-02', 'CompanyReplyTime': '09:21:01'}
