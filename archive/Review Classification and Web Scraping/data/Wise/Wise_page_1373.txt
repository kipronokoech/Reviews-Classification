They used to be a remarkable amazing company. When they got bought out and changed their name things changed terribly. Before it took minutes to transfer money. Now it takes me on average a month, once 8 weeks. I asked them to cancel the transfer and return the money and they said that was impossible. Before you could call and get a responsive caring person to solve any problems. Now you will be on hold for hours and get someone from a call center that doesn't know anything.\n\nI am not exaggerating. It has gotten so bad that I am closing my accounts with Wise and going elsewhere. I need to be confident that when I am making payments they will be received in a timely manner.\n\nIt is sad to see such a great payment option deteriorate so quickly into a disaster.", 'review_date': '2022-07-21', 'review_time': '20:51:39', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

The staff from their overseas team put the transaction on hold after receiving my money and asked for a non-existent physical document, signed and "notarised" in the country were the money was coming from, in order to verify an operation that in fact was quite normal and made electronically with a major bank. The telephone support in the UK was also unhelpful. After a long time on hold, I talked to a person who didn\'t seem to be local and who kept repeating the same script over and over again (saying basically that no phone support can be given before 48h, no matter the issue). When I asked for a manager I was told that there were no managers in the Customer Support since everyone was equal there (sic). Any other department was just unreachable, the web chat was not working and when I tried to call them again at 4pm, the phone lines were already closed. A critical payment was not made on time since the money went back and will need to be wired to the UK again through a different institution, but most importantly it will be very difficult to restore the level of trust I had before and send any pressing transfer via Wise ever again. Things work well on auto mode but if any assistance is needed there is no way to get it for at least two days.', 'review_date': '2022-07-22', 'review_time': '11:49:50', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
