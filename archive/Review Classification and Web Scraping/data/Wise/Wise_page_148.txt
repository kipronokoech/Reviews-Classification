Unfortunately all my attempts to talk to client support have been unsuccessful. When I tried to get verified they just swallowed my documents without any feedback. I've sent sensitive information and I expect that it will be treated with caution and high level of security. But instead I see errors, pages randomly reload and there is no feedback for the customer. It looks like they don't care at all. I wouldn't trust such company. If Wise want to do something about it I have screen recordings.
