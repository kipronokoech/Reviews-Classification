I have used transferwise many times for smaller amounts, and it works great. But transferring bigger amounts doesn't work. I moved to Brazil a year ago, and they required tax documents from a year I wasn't living here. The communication between the bank in Brazil who processed the documents was really bad. There was no dialog at all. They took 3 days to respond to each email, and just kept asking for the same documents that doesn't exist. Transferwise's support was also not very helpful, and kept saying that I just need to provide those documents that I don't have because I didn't live here in 2019. So if you just moved to a new country and need to transfer big amount I would do a normal wire transfer through your bank. The service was really disappointing, and they held my money for 3-4 weeks, and suddenly they just refunded they amount without any explanation.", 'review_date': '2021-02-02', 'review_time': '12:01:06', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nFeb 12, 2021\nThanks for sharing your feedback with us, Nicholas.\n\nAs you didn't share the transfer number or contact information, we're unable to elaborate on this specific transfer, however when you send money to Brazil, there are local and federal regulations that we must comply with, and that's why we'll ask you for additional documentation.\n\nWhile we aim to complete this process as fast as possible, after receiving the documents, Banco Rendimento can take 3–6 working days to review and approve them. When the documents are approved, the transfer will be completed.\n\nThe reason why your transfer could have been cancelled and refunded, was because as you have shared here, you were unable to provide all the documents requested. That means, we're unable to complete your payment. In that case, we'll refund you.\n\nAll the best,\nTransferWise", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2021-02-12', 'CompanyReplyTime': '12:21:03'}
