We completely understand you, price increase is never pleasant. Unfortunately, markets have been more volatile recently, which makes it more expensive for us to buy and sell currencies — so we need to raise our fees to cover those costs.\n\nPlease bear in mind that our mission is to be eventually free for our customers, and we're working hard every day to achieve that.\n\nWe continue to sustainably invest in our infrastructure, so you can move money faster and more conveniently. We need to reflect this in our price today, to help us bring down the cost of moving money in the future.\n\nWise.", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2022-12-14', 'CompanyReplyTime': '12:29:37'}
