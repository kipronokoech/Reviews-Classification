I got an email sent by Pablo ( staff in wise) that he has deactivated my account because I have sent money to Sudan. Never in my three years with Wise have I received /sent or associated with the country, don't get me wrong, I hold nothing against beautiful Sudan.\n\nI did not appeal; all I wanted was my balance back: I had a business account with a $$$$$ balance. So I sent Laura the Alternative bank account to refund my balance. Thanks to the customer's services team, my refund was complete within ten days. Pro tip: I spoke to a customer services agent who told me not to email a lot because they would further push my case. Instead advised me to call. I called customer services every day and spoke politely to them. They all promised to push for my refund, which I believe they did. I also filed a complaint to CFPB against Wise and Community Federal Bank. I'm not sure which one played the magic.\n\nIs wise a scam? I'm not sure, but I wouldn't recommend saving your monies with this company. Just transact with them and don't hold more than a $150 balance to avoid headaches or your business sinking. They don't give a F* if it's a business account when they deactivate your account.\n\nDo they refund? Yes, they did refund my monies to the last penny, and it did not take months or weeks.\n\nWill I ever use WISE again? HELL NO, I'd stick to the traditional bank that has a physical bank in almost every state. For transfer, I'd instead settle for other familiar companies with branches everywhere. Wise is not worth it; cheap is very expensive.\n\nMy recommendation. If you have to use wise, limit your transfer to monies you can lose or live without. Raise complaints to any financial protection institution. Speak nicely to those customer agents they can be nice", 'review_date': '2022-01-16', 'review_time': '18:58:24', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nFeb 22, 2022\nHello Megan,\n\nWe understand having your account closed is frustrating, but rest assured this is never done without a reason. We only close accounts that are in conflict with our Terms of Use. If you think a mistake was made, we do have an appeal process in place, which you could have followed up with.\n\nWe'll always refund remaining balances, we just need to carry due diligence checks first.\n\nWise.", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2022-02-22', 'CompanyReplyTime': '09:51:00'}
