A couple of friends had a negative experience trying to send money to me and yet they still sent money through Wise to me repeatedly afterward and without incident.\nWise says they return pending monies that were expected to show up on Wise AFTER they freeze accounts and yet i am being told by the people that sent monies that those monies have not been returned and have been lost to them. Wise is still sending me emails after they closed my account asking me to appeal the original decision. It seems to me at Wise - the left hand and the right hand don’t know what each other is doing. I realize there are criminals out there but I do not break laws.\n\nI had been using Wise successfully for approximately 5 months or so with no problems until October 8th when Wise froze my account I had transfers from friends on the account that I had processed, which was a small amount, which Wise eventually sent to me approximately 10 days later. I kept good records of who sent and how much so Wise had to process those payments as I already had confirmation from Wise before October 8th that Wise was sending them to me.\nThe Appeal process - even following the prompts, I couldn’t get access to appeal so I had to do it from the email address that I registered with Wise and Wise had on file. That was not a problem for me. I provided Wise with the documentation they asked for. Keep in mind that almost 8 months later I had a different hairstyle and the lighting was not the same as when you go to the DMV. They ask for personal information that they should not be asking for and they asked for that information on a long weekend when I was not home and did not have access to it. People do not give your SS# or your SIN#. That is information no one should ask you for.\nWise does not care about their customers or who they hurt. Nobody should have their money locked down. The payments that Wise said they were sending to me BEFORE they froze my account should have been sent to me. I should not have been made to wait some 10 days for them. I even provided Wise with a list of all the transactions that they confirmed were being processed. Still I was made to wait.\nThink long and hard before you decide to use Wise and then don't. Mark my words - one day you will be doing a harmless transaction and without warning the money you were receiving or sending will be frozen and held in limbo until Wise is good and ready to send it to you.", 'review_date': '2023-10-24', 'review_time': '13:42:21', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nOct 24, 2023\nHey Tylene,\nWe understand that this can be stressful, and we never take these decisions lightly. Our customers are our upmost priority, and we're sorry to hear that you feel this way.\n\nOnce an account is closed, all pending/incoming transfers are cancelled and sent back to the originating accounts. For the remaining balances, our customers need to appeal and provide us with the bank details. During the appeal process, our team reviews your appeal thoroughly, which can take some time.\n\nRegarding the emails, it's true that we need our customers to reach out from their registered email addresses due to security concerns. If you send emails to our address for appeals, that can be the reason why you're receiving appeal numbers.\n\nThat being said, it looks like our dedicated team has emailed you on October 20th with update on your account and relevant documents. Please check when you can.\n\nWe appreciate you taking the time to explain this to us and give us feedback.\n\nWise", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2023-10-24', 'CompanyReplyTime': '10:41:24'}
