And you‚Äôll only ever pay for what you use. No asterisks. No small print. No hidden fees.\n\nThe cost of your transfer depends on several factors: the currencies you use, the payment method you choose, and the current market exchange rate. You can find out more about our fees here: https://wi.se/ourfees\n\nWe‚Äôve also introduced a tool that calculates the fees for your transfer, so you can see the cost before you set it up.
