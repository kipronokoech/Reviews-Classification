Tried contacting customer care for help. but they have mentioned that guaranteed rate is permanently disabled for my account since I had booked some amounts for transfer but cancelled them at a later stage. If I as a customer see that the rates are changing frequently, I have the full right to cancel a booked transfer, and since the money transfer is anyways not initiated untill I have done the payment to Wise, I don't find the reasoning very logical.
