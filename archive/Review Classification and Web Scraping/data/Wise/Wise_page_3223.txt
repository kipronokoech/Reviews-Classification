If you check the transfer on your account and you see no changes, it's very important to keep an eye for emails from us, but you can always reach us out instead and we'll update you right away.\n\nKeep an eye on your app for updates about your transfer is also very important. If the payment is pending for longer than one working day, this might mean we need additional information.\n\nIf you wish to file a complaint, please follow the steps here: https://wi.se/complaintsprocedure_\n\nAll the best,\nWise Team.", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2021-05-24', 'CompanyReplyTime': '15:26:35'}
