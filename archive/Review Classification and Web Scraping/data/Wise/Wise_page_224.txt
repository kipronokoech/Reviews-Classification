A financial institution should understand the importance of promptly and transparently resolving financial matters, yet Wise has demonstrated a shocking indifference to the hardships their delays cause. This behavior is not only unprofessional but also raises serious concerns about the security of customer funds entrusted to their care.\n\nIt is unacceptable that Wise has failed to address my request for a refund, even after an agonizing 30-day wait. The constant runaround, with no end in sight, has shown a complete disregard for their customers' financial well-being. Such incompetence and unwillingness to rectify the situation only serve to erode any trust one might have had in their services.\n\nFurthermore, the lack of communication and accountability from Wise during this distressing ordeal is deeply concerning. Instead of providing clear updates or honest explanations for the delays, their responses have been automatically generated replies by a bot.\nThis further demonstrates their disregard for the customers who rely on them for trustworthy and efficient financial services.\n\nI implore anyone considering utilizing Wise's services to proceed with caution. The unacceptable delays in refunding customer funds and the lack of integrity displayed by the institution should serve as a stark warning. Entrusting your hard-earned money to a company that exhibits such negligence and unprofessionalism is a risk not worth taking.", 'review_date': '2023-06-24', 'review_time': '02:11:13', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
