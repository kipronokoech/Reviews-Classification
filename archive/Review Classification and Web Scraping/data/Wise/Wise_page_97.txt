Kindly check your inbox. When you accidentally transfer money to the wrong recipient, then you can cancel the transfer before it's send out.\n\nHowever, you can‚Äôt cancel a completed transfer. All transfers completed by Wise are final, and Wise can‚Äôt reverse or recall payments. Once your transfer is marked as completed on our website, we can‚Äôt cancel it.\n\nWise does not have the ability to be involved in disputes between senders and recipients. So we strongly recommend that you know and trust the person or business that you are sending to before setting up a transfer or sending any money.\n\nWhile we can‚Äôt get involved in disputes, we try to do everything we can to keep our customers safe. We‚Äôll investigate any claims of fraud, and, if we find that someone has used Wise to receive money fraudulently, we‚Äôll block them from receiving money through us.\n\nWise", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2023-09-07', 'CompanyReplyTime': '09:13:22'}
