I pointed out I hadn't received they money do not sure how that made me a recipient. The sender also opened cases which were dismissed asking the recipient to follow up with their bank account.

Why wouldn't they alert everyone affected?!\nA real bank would be able to extend an overdraft to cover their error, but they were unable and/or unwilling to alleviate the burden that they created with their poor planning and communications.
