But recently started noticing that the fees are so high that it has been more expensive than almost any other option available every time! It's not been just once or twice, but every time in the past year or so, and I don't see why paying extra is worth it here.\n\nSecond, what really is annoying (and justifies the 2 stars) is that it started using Plaid for facilitating ACH transfers. This is incredibly unsafe. Now this option requires you to enter your bank's username and password along with the 2 factor authentication, on the TransferWise/Plaid website!! This is a major security risk. I work in software, and know enough about cryptography/security that this is in no way a good practice, just a workaround for not having the bank's API providing them the data. What was the need to replace the older system of doing the ACH transfer using routing and account number? With Plaid, the users are forced to share an unnecessary and incredible amount of their financial data (and bank login info) with a third party that might not be able keep it safe.\n\nThe high fees and payment system really need to be fixed ASAP to gain back my trust.", 'review_date': '2021-10-04', 'review_time': '15:02:14', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nOct 28, 2021\nThanks for sharing your feedback with us.\n\nWe also have a cost to process your payment, and this is reflected in our fees. We're working towards a free to use product, but we haven't reached this goal just yet. Until then, we'll always disclose our fees before you pay for your transfer, and we keep our pricing as transparent (and low) as possible.\n\nWe understand your concern, but we work very hard to keep your data safe. However, if you prefer, there are also different type of payment methods available.\n\nWise.", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2021-10-28', 'CompanyReplyTime': '12:04:41'}
