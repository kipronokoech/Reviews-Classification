I use wise to receive my payments from two companies that I work with as self employed, and I was asked for documentation of bank statements proving my relationship with the companies. I forwarded my bank statement and my passport as requested and they declined my documentation and now blocked my account. I have a considerable amount that I will use to pay my tax to HMRC now in January and wise has blocked any and all transfers that I receive in this account. I've sent several emails to wise and I still haven't had any response. In the last email, the attendant instructed me to submit my documents again, but the link says that the documents are being verified and that I need to wait.
