The app has been reliable, the recent roll out of a stock index is interesting, though I use an ISA for investing.\n\nI did use to use a card but found it was not cost effective overseas in comparison to transferring money to a local account and either withdrawing cash or acquiring a local debit/credit card.\n\nI really want to give Wise 5 stars, but there are some features I need to see. Firstly, cryptocurrency integration or permitting payments to cryptocurrency related companies. I do not like that this is not allowed, frankly Wise is shooting itself in the foot. Secondly, an ISA account would be useful, even if it wasn’t a stocks and shares ISA… given funds would be easily transferable to other countries if needed for emergencies. Lastly, credit cards or p2p lending makes sense in my eyes to be considered as a part of the Wise model.\n\nConclusion:\nAs it stands, Wise is a powerful remittance tool, although IBKR is more cost effective for large transactions ($10k+) and has more currencies available (though you need a brokerage account and domestic bank accounts in the currency you wish to receive). I do not see how Wise can be anything more than a remittance tool in its current form, which seems silly given it could easily expand its operations and offerings to its already wide user base… so I will continue using Wise to move small amounts of money, but I hope they expand and can use other revenue streams to reduce remittance costs over $10k in the future.', 'review_date': '2021-12-29', 'review_time': '01:38:41', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
