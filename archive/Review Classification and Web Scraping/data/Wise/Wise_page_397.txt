We are a green tick charity with the ACNC, we publish our audited financial results annually and we have an ABN, an Incorporation number and a Charity Funding No. but we do not have an ACN nor an ARCN so the Wise system would not let us set up a business account as they do not have a business category for a not-for-profit or a charity. the other categories ask for something we do not have such as an ACN. As i needed to pay a bill to a company who only accepts Wise transfers or a credit card I decided to set it up as an individual but using the charity account so i could pay the bill. I am the main signatory on the account and any account card has my name on it. the individual set up was not too onerous and successful. i went a head a transferred the money from the charities account to pay a bill the charity is responsible for. Wise Happily took my money but then said they could not transfer it to the recipient even though the company was identified. i then wrote an email about not being able to set up the company account. A couple of days later wrote another email about the money being held by wise and not transferred as requested, then yesterday a third email about this horrible experience because as the bill has not been paid as requested we are now locked out of the software service. This resulted in our charity not being able to operate as we are dependent on the software service we were trying to pay, which holds all our records. It took me several days to find a phone number of Wise, as no one had acknowledged any of the three emails i had sent over a period of a week. This has been the worst banking or finance industry experience i have ever had to contend with. All I wanted was a bill to be paid as we did not have a credit card to do so. Wise had the money from us to do so for a week, they had not acknowledged any of the emails sent and it was extremely difficult to find a phone number that worked. The current published phone number for Wise Australian customers had been changed. I can not recommend this banking service at all. It has bought our charity to a holt due to its systems. I will not ever recommend this banking service to anyone and will never use it again myself.', 'review_date': '2023-04-13', 'review_time': '08:10:47', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
