The transfer is interrupted and I have to send documents (from sending bank) to show proof it is me sending. The second time I spoke to someone about it, to find out why/what was the problem, I was assured it was fixed and I wouldn\'t have the problem any longer. And then it happened the 3rd (latest) time I transferred. The only difference I see is a middle initial that appears on my sending bank account. Nothing has changed with any of my information, and these are the same two accounts I\'ve been using since I opened my (Transfer)Wise account in 2016. Never had this issue before, but seems now I do. I chatted again with customer service to find out what I am doing wrong, and why it keeps happening. I was told "I see here that you sent us documents last time to show proof of name and transfer" and "you\'re doing everything right". I asked if I needed to update my Wise account name to include the middle initial, would that help? I was told, "If you want to!" That person then told me they would pass it along to the appropriate dept who will add my (sending) account to the "approved sender account". Then I received an email as a follow-up from the chat plainly saying, "we sent you an email requesting these documents and you need to do it." The bottom line is, I have no confidence this issue is resolved and I expect to run into the same thing again. Which inevitably makes me lose the guaranteed rate. (history shows the money leaves my bank account within 24 hrs) So far that isn\'t a big amount, but I\'m tired of the hassle.\nUpdate: The obvious point is, why wasnâ€™t this name change solution offered the first time, not mention the 3rd! The interruption may be automatic, but talking to customer service should end with it being resolved.

A solution would be to update your name on your Wise account to match the one on your local bank account or vice-versa.\n\nIf you wish to do that, please reach us at https://wi.se/contactus_, and we'll guide you.\n\nAll the best,\nWise Team.", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2021-07-05', 'CompanyReplyTime': '12:06:58'}
