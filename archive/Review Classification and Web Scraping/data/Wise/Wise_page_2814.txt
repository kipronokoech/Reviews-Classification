I do, however, remember a day, where I did the transfer first thing in the morning and by midday the money had already reached its destination. Now, this is truly exceptional!\n\nLastly, I only had to use their customer services once recently, due to an error of mine. I was put through to a customer service representative within seconds of calling (not even a minute, I think) and then she was so incredibly helpful that I really felt that she had my best interest at heart!\n\nI truly only have good things to say about Wise!

After being with Wise for nearly a year with both business and personal accounts and recommending them to clients and friends, they demanded some information while I was on holiday, some of which is shown at companies House.\nI informed them I would be back in 2 days to answer their questions but 48 hours later they shut my account and decided to forget the thousands in the savings pots telling me I only had £290. What a bunch of short sighted bankers! This type of behaviour perhaps shows why you should only trust a bonafide bank and not a bunch of fintech amateurs. Be careful with this lot.\nLatest update. They have refused to reopen the account although they now agree they 'forgot' the money in the pots. But more pathetic news...they have decided not to reopen the account for absolutely no reason, and decided I can only have the money back in one currency when I have two, thereby costing me money, and they will decide when I can have it back!!
