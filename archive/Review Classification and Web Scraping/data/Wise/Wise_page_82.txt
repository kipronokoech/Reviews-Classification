But delays do happen for different reasons. It could be because the transfer was set up closer to the weekend/holidays, or because we needed to carry extra checks.

I have to say that so far, it has proven to be formidable. The physical Visa card is accepted everywhere, and the commissions are really low. It is also very simple and extraordinarily fast to send money from your account to personal or other people's e-wallets, such as GoPay, Shoppe Pay, and Ovo, which are widely used in Indonesia to pay both in physical stores and online (the static commission for the transfer is only 9K idr = $0.60). Wise gives the possibility of creating virtual cards linked to the account, a very useful option for online purchases as they can be blocked immediately after the operation. Using a bank transfer, you pay nothing to transfer the money into your Wise account, but if you need a quick option, you can use Appe Pay or a credit card for a small fee. During my experience in Indonesia, I encountered local shops, such as nail salons and pastry shops (Daifuku Mochi), that accepted a bank transfer as the only payment. Well, I didn't have any problems with Wise since it is also possible to transfer money to local banks cheaply and quickly. Only flaw, the card does not work with Grab(but does work with Gojek), but it is not particularly a problem given the ease of transferring money into E-Wallets. Highly recommended for travel.", 'review_date': '2023-09-20', 'review_time': '13:32:05', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
