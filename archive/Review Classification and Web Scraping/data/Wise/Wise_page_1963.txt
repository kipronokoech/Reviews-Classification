Luckily I realised that the transfer seemed to be taking a long time so I checked and found out that the transfer was on hold, but if I hadnâ€™t have checked would they ever have asked or just kept the money they had received??\n\n12/05/22 - In reply to Wise's comment, if you read my comment the issue is that the transfer was stuck and I wasn't informed. I have no problem with you needing to perform extra checks but you do need to keep your clients informed and request information if you need it, there have been two occaisions where this hasn't happened and my money has been stuck somewhere with no word from Wise - it's important that customers can trust Wise with their money, and when money is just held somewhere and no information is given this has a very negative impact on trust.", 'review_date': '2022-05-12', 'review_time': '09:07:00', 'CompanyReply': 'Reply from Wise\nMay 12, 2022\nHello Nicola,\n\nWhile our goal is to complete all payments as fast as we can, weâ€™re a regulated financial institution and as such, we need to carry extra checks on transfers from time to time.
