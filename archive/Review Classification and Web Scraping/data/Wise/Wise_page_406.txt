Easy to use application.\nWhat I don't like?\nThe cost of the transfer have sky rocketed. Which is something seems to be not fair. As a long term user I can say this, I know this well. If its going to be like this, I might unfortunately end up closing my account and use some other platform, as its too expensive.\nThis is something I would give my honest feedback to their higher management to consider rather loosing customers.\n\nMany thanks,", 'review_date': '2023-04-08', 'review_time': '11:46:10', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
