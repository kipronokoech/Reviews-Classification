On multiple occasions I have been with a merchant and they have used my card once, yet there were 3 transactions for the same amount debited.

When calling TransferWise for help, the staff are rude and say itâ€™s the merchantâ€™s fault for requesting 3 payments. I explained that I was with the merchant and I saw them only process the first transaction, this is an issue with TransferWise.

And sorry that you didn't get the best customer support experience as you should.\n\nUsually, indeed, it's the merchant who automatically pulls your data/money, and it's not us. We never process payments without your consent. Most probably, these 2 payments are pending in your account, and will get reversed shortly. If the merchant reverses it, then it'll happen right away, but automatically they would get reversed within 17 days.\n\nHope this clarified a bit more, and that you can get it sorted shortly.\n\nWise team.", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2022-09-29', 'CompanyReplyTime': '11:27:53'}
