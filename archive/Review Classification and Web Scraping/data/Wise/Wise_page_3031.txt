I reached out to their customer rep 4 times during those 2 weeks, and everytime they assured me it would be done within the next 3 business days. Quite frustrating experience, and had to pay late fees since the other party didn\'t receive the money on time.

If your account was freshly made, it can take longer to complete a first payment, should verification be necessary (Especially if it happens to be a business account, which would require additional details), but once that's done, it shouldn't affect new transfers going forward.\n\nWe also welcome any feed back to our support team here: https://wise.com/help/contact so that we can better improve the experience.\n\nHope this helps,\nWise team", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2021-07-20', 'CompanyReplyTime': '11:24:48'}
