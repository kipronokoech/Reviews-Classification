I am doing a money transfer from HK dollars to USD 6 days ago. It just holds my transfer without reason. I initiated contact after a day asking why was the wait. They then let me know I need ID proof because it was above 1000 USD. OK, I uploaded it right after their reply. But over the past 5 days, they kept requesting the image of the back of my ID which they didn\'t say in the first email. I uploaded it several times, and even direct emailed them several times. They just ignored it, and replied with a standard "template" saying "please upload the back of my ID". I am so pissed off by their negligent, careless, and dopey attitude. My money transfer was for a present before the Lunar New Year. Now I definitely will miss it. Wonder who were responding to my case?
