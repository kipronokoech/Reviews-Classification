This isn't something we take lightly. It's normally a result of a conflict with our Terms of Service or Customer Agreement, or due to a discrepancy with a financial law.

Please keep in mind that this process might take up to 10 working days.\n\nAs for your remaining money in your account, we'll work on sending it back to you. But first, we need to carry out due diligence checks. While we do that, your money and information will be safe and secure.\n\nWise", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2022-07-26', 'CompanyReplyTime': '12:23:38'}

I found they were slow to acknowledge receipt of funds and then annoyingly wanted verification that I had actually sent the funds. I guess that is ok in this world of needing money laundering checks but why not ask for it immediately they receive it rather than delay the transaction. Worst though is that they have just cancelled a transaction that clearly went against them when the currency moved in my favour. I got them the funds on time and then they cancelled the deal. I think that is really bad.. they should honour the deal they promised. I still have not got the money back but that is partly my doing as I want to find out why they cancelled my deal.

Awkward if you count on timeliness.

Completely hit or miss, so I cannot count on this card and have to carry cash after all. My recommendation to WISE: Ditch the (Mastercard) credit card association so the card is treated as a bank (account) (debit) card (as it actually is).
