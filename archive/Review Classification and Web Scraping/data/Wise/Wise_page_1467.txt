Wise is no different. We’re a regulated financial institution, and verification is how we keep your money safe, and comply with the financial regulations in the countries we operate in. We do our best to complete verification as soon as possible, and it’s usually done within 2 – 4 working days. In rare cases, it might take longer if we need additional information, but we’ll always let you know if that’s the case.\n\nWe'll make sure to keep you updated about the status via email, so do keep an eye there.\n\nWise", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2022-07-06', 'CompanyReplyTime': '11:07:03'}

But if that time has passed, make sure to share the PDF transfer receipt with them: https://wi.se/getpdfreceipt_ so they could track the money with it with their bank.\n\nHope this helps, but if anything else, do let us know by calling/emailing, and we'll get back to you ASAP.\n\nWise", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2022-07-06', 'CompanyReplyTime': '11:09:43'}

About a month ago I had a problem with the verification of my account due to new guidelines. I tried to do it via the website but there was a bug on the website, so I couldn't. For this reason, I contacted customer service. The chat agent was rude, told me that he will reach me via email, and ended the chat. He's never contacted me via email. Then I called customer service, the agent send me an external link for verification, I send a scan of my documents there. There was no follow-up from Wise. After a month a realized that verification still hasn't been finalized. I'm trying to reach them now, but the line is all the time busy, and the chat agent doesn't answer. I wanted to redo verification via the website, but the bug hasn't been fixed yet. Very poor customer service. This experience made me lose my trust. I also don't understand why I could input the money into the Wise account, but I cannot withdraw them without verification....", 'review_date': '2022-07-05', 'review_time': '16:42:36', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
