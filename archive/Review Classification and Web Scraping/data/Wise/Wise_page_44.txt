Please be sure to double-check your inbox for details.\n\nWe take customer verification very seriously, as we are a financial institution that needs to comply with regulations. It's essential for us to know who is using our service, why they are using it, and that their funds come from a legitimate source. This process helps us combat money laundering and ensures the safety of everyone's money.\n\nThat's not all ‚Äì we also have different regional regulatory requirements. Which is why we might need to ask more ‚Äì or different ‚Äì questions, depending on where you move money to or from, or where you live.\n\nThe verification process can occur at different stages of your journey with Wise, and sometimes we might need to reverify our customers. This is to ensure that our records are up-to-date and to maintain a high level of security.\n\nShould you have other questions, reach out to us at: https://wi.se/contactus or send us a private message on X (Twitter), Facebook, or Instagram with your email and user number.
