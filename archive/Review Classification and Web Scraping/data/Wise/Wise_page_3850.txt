If this was a payment to her TransferWise Balance, then the payment is most likely in the process of being run through due diligence checks, before we're able to return it. We're required to run these checks due to how we're regulated, and in some cases they can take some time to complete.\n\nOnce they're done, our Appeals team will be sure to contact you directly with more information. If you have contacted them in the meantime, they'll be sure to reply back within 10 working days.\n\nBest wishes,\nTransferWise Team", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2020-11-12', 'CompanyReplyTime': '12:57:11'}

Thank you!', 'message': "Until now, it seemed like a great idea to use transferwise and its options to simultaneously manage accounts in several currencies. But today that I needed to use one of the balances to make a local transfer, it is taking today ... !!! In one business day ... !!! banking...!!! more than (14 hours). Problems like this shouldn't happen, as one of the reasons for having a transferwise account is the offer of immediacy between transactions. Understand that businesses and opportunities and transactions between them managed by us, are the true origin of the demand for an immediate currency transfer since opportunities and businesses do not wait, they must be closed with the greatest immediacy. That 0.3 missing for 5 may have to do with details like this.

Likewise, the previous fee of 2% for any withdrawals after, has been reduced to 1.75% instead.\n\nOverall, if it helps, then the main thing to keep in mind is to remember the first two free withdrawals a month, as any others beyond that would largely remain either unchanged or slightly cheaper, depending on the amount.\n\nBest wishes,\nTransferWise Team', 'CompanyReplyDate': '2020-11-12', 'CompanyReplyTime': '12:38:29'}
