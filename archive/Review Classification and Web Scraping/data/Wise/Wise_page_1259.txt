However, we have tried to make several payments to friends in India in recent months and Wise have ended up returning the money to us after several weeks, having not bothered to tell us in the meantime that there was any problem. Indeed the payment timeline has said every time that the money was in our friends' accounts. We have returned to Moneygram for this type of transaction. However, we have just booked a holiday in India and thought we would use Wise to pay the deposit. They have messed around doing nothing for a week before bothering to ask for an invoice with the holiday booking details. We're heartily sick of them.", 'review_date': '2022-08-10', 'review_time': '17:03:59', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

But now they have become too big for their britches and arrogant.\nAs mentioned I have been transferring for years always about Â£1000-Â£1500 to Japanese Yen. This time I wired the money to them, so they could transfer it to Japan But nothing happened, so I called them and spoke to a woman, who I told that this transfer was time sensitive,then she said that she does not see the money arriving. She said she would send me an email to upload a copy of the bank transfer, which I did immediately. Then no response for two day then they send me a request for proof of income.\nIn the meantime, this money was for an auction of a very important item that I needed and was only available in Japan.\nNeedless to say the money never arrived. And the item was sold elsewhere. Why the woman I spoke to did not ask for the proof of income is beyond me.\nWhen this company offered me the opportunity to invest a few years ago, with them I declined as I wanted to see how they would do in the long term.
