{'platform': 'Wise', 'id': '643eb5931cb911c36a265723', 'stars': 1, 'title': 'This Company is an Absolute JOKE!', 'message': 'This company is an absolute joke! Here is the story. I\'m making an App, using a fellow overseas. I want to transfer him the money he is owed ($4000), but Wise says that you can\'t transfer more than $425 US to his currency. I send 3 payments of $425 and then we decide to send $1225 US to US, no conversion. That worked. Then I go to send another $1500 and Wise deactivates both our accounts. I look at my bank account and the original $2500 amount is gone. The recipient didn\'t get the money out of his account, so he hasn\'t been paid as it is sitting in his closed account that he can\'t access. I tried to make an appeal and I get an instantaneous response saying that "After reviewing your case we\'ve decided to keep your account closed." Go through their site to try other ways and it blocks you from communicating. I finally found a phone number, but of course the two different "customer service" persons can\'t see or do anything and that I have to go back to the website and file an appeal - once again I get the "After reviewing your case we\'ve decided to keep your account closed."\n\nThis is an abomination. You can\'t communicate with them on the web, you can\'t communicate with them in email and when you finally get to talk to someone, they are using VOIP from some poor person in the Philippines who you can barely hear or their English is substandard. You try to talk to this person and they can\'t see the transactions to be able to help you. RETURN MY MONEY.\n\nUpdate: April 20, 2023. I am first going to laugh at their little response below as the Appeal process is just another automated stall tactic. Before I update the rest of you with the absolute nightmare that happened yesterday - I\'ll wait for the response from the "Appeal" team first. BTW, this is getting criminally juicy to the tune of the California Attorney General.\n\nWISE - you better start responding to your customers!\n\nApril 22, 2023 I am officially letting whomever wishes to read this know of the criminality of this company and their subsidiary WorldRemit. As stated above, On April 19, 2023 I spent an entire day with the IT people at Wise. The IT people logged into my Wise account, did something, opened a WorldRemit account and proceeded to start paying a Joy Sarkar $777.00 and a Badhon Saha $571.03 by taking funds out of my Wells Fargo Bank Account! I asked the IT "specialist" what he was doing and he assured me all was good that this is how we return the money to all the people affected by the Deactivation of My and the original intended person\'s Account. While sitting on the phone from 7:30 am to 12:30 pm waiting on all this, I decided to have a look at my Wells Fargo account. Sure enough, they were stealing money out of my account. Not only do they have my original $2500, they\'re brazenly stealing money out of my bank account while correcting other people\'s problem. Anybody reading this - WARNING Do Not Use This Company. If you have any recommendations to continue to get the word out, please let me know as I am fully invested in a negative internet campaign.\n\nApril 24, 2023 Left the CEO and the Chairman a "nice" message this morning in Linkedin messaging to return my $2500 plus the $777 and $571.03. It\'s now evening and no response.\n\nApril 27, 2023 Today I have filed an eCrime complaint with the FBI and the California Attorney General.\n\nApril 29, 2023 I continue to communicate to their open Appeal process that was started on April 18, 2023. As they say below, I can appeal, but if no-one answers the automated Appeal, what\'s the use of Appealing? I have also contacted the Better Business Bureau and filed a complaint with them. Either they answer the BBB or the BBB will leave a nice comment on the company at the BBB.org website.\n\nMay 8th. I actually received an automated email on May 2nd from them saying they were looking into it! Nothing to look into, they have my money, my client does not and we have gone nowhere. I do have a lot of federal agencies looking into them, so a nice file is being built against them.\n\nMay 16, 2023 My recipient texted me and said that he has received the money I sent him April 10th but his Wise account is still closed. No word from my friends at Wise. I send them a message stating that the recipient has received his money, what\'s going on. They actually get back to me and say that the recipient did receive his money, here are the receipts.\n\nTHIS HAS BEEN THE MOST USELESS WASTE OF MY TIME THAT I\'VE HAD IN A LONG TIME. If you are reading this - find another way to transfer money and don\'t use these guys.
