I bought CAD and USD from a GBP debit card to fund future local purchases in the US and Canada, timing transfers to get a good rate, and paying fees accordingly. I increased my GBP balance to fund purchases in Colombia, but found Wise used all my CAD balance (and some EURs), which again incurred fees. Now I will have to purchase more CAD to cover spending in Canada in a few days, with a third lot of fees and at a less favourable rate than before. Useless!\nUpdate: Wise suggest that if I have more questions I should email them. The only question is how do I get my CAD balance back without having to pay a third set of fees. Answer (which I know already) is it can't be done.
