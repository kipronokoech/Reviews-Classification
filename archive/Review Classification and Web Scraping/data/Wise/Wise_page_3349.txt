I transferred money between my own bank accounts as I am living overseas at he moment. After two days the app said the transaction had been “successful”. After one week of desperately waiting for my money for living it was me who had to track back the whole process to find out they needed more documents to verify the transaction and then they said it would take 2-5 more work days from now on! Promoting 2 days and actually taking 2 weeks seems like a massive lie and I am in big trouble overseas without my own money because of WISE now.
