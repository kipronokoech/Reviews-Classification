But this time looking at the number of Excelend here I have to say something else.\nI use Wiese as long as they called Transferwise before and that time they make good job and service (this could be the reason for so many Excelent opoinions above lol).\nSo what I learned as well is to check the date of the last opinions - not the old once.\nBack toWise: last weeks EVERY of my transfers has been paused and explained with any security or documents check has to be done (!?). If you ask what, you dont get precise answer but any blabla around the target, not about it.\nIn my last transfer yday: after they stopped it (paused) the first explanation they said was next day to complete the transfer. In this next day the status was sitll paused but information changed - they need then not one but until 5 working days more to approve and do their job lol.\nAfter my angry email to them (since they freezed my money working with it) I've got a replay as they need now.... read that joke here:\n.....It can take up to 17 working days to review your transfer — but it can take longer. We'll let you know when we're done, or if we need any more information from you.....\nWhat I have to say as well, before (1-2 yrs ago) the transfer and confirmation lasts 2-3 seconds and the receipient got the money next working day into its bank acconunt.\nNow not the same, Wise isn't able to transfer money at all by amount wide under 1000 €! They just lie and tell not true stories about the reason of freezing customer money while transfer processing.\nThey belong to court as what they do is criminal. They explain, that they are financial institut and sombody obligated them for such things to do what they do.\nWell, they deserve 0 stars, not even 1.\nBased on my experience with Wise is My recommendation - hands off!", 'review_date': '2022-12-15', 'review_time': '18:58:42', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
