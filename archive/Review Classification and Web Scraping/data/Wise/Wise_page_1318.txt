I am nearly two weeks past depositing money for a transfer, with them first advising they could not find my transfer. Once I produced a receipt from my Bank showing all the transfer details, they acknowledged saying it was "a known issue" and that they were unable to provide me with more information. To date, my recipient has not received the wire. Below are the actual messages I received from their customer service in response to my more desperate appeals for information (it is my rent check). You judge whether you would trust them with your money.\n---------\nHi XXX,\n\nI hope this email finds you well.\n\nMe and my team agreed that you do deserve a refund for the rate changing due to the technical issue. By my estimations, the rate decrease resulted in a loss of 45.25 USD. We will be able to refund that amount back to you.\n\nIs there an account in your recipients tab that you would prefer the funds send to?\n\nHave a great rest of your day and please don\'t hesitate to reach out with any more questions.\nXXX - Customer Support - Wise\n\nJul 29, 2022, 21:19 GMT+2\n\nHi XXX,\n\nThanks for reaching out today, and I hope this email finds you well.\n\nMy team notified me that they were now able to link the funds to this transfer, and it\'s now in the conversion process. This process can take 1-2 working days, but is usually faster than that. And once it\'s complete we\'ll automatically send out your transfer.\n\nIt doesn\'t look like we were able to maintain the guaranteed rate, but look me see if there\'s something else I\'m able to do for you here. I\'ll update you on that shortly.\n\nHave a great rest of your day and please don\'t hesitate to reach out with any more questions.\nXXX - Customer Support - Wise\n\nIan (Wise)\n\nJul 29, 2022, 20:36 GMT+2\n\nHi XXX,\n\nThanks for reaching out today, and I hope this email finds you well.\n\nI\'ll reach out to my payments team to see if we\'re able to go about the refund option, I\'ll update you here as soon as I can.\n\nHave a great rest of your day and please don\'t hesitate to reach out with any more questions.\nXXX - Customer Support - Wise\n\nJul 27, 2022, 19:29 GMT+2\n\nHi XXX,\n\nThanks for reaching out today, and I hope this email finds you well.\n\nI apologize we don\'t have more information to give. I can confirm that we\'ve received your funds, but that due to the larger technical issue we\'re facing, we\'re not able to fully import the deposits into our system.\n\nWe\'re hoping to have this resolved shortly, either today or tomorrow is a current estimate, but we can\'t guarantee that.\n\nI totally understand your frustration, and would never tell a customer they shouldn\'t handle the matter with whatever legal action they deem necessary.\n\nI went ahead and added a free transfer credit to your account for your inconvenience. This will cover the fees for a transfer of up to 500 GBP in size, and will automatically be applied to your next transaction. Here\'s a guide on how these free transfer credits work.\n\nHave a great rest of your day and please don\'t hesitate to reach out with any more questions.\nXXX- Customer Support - Wise\n\nJul 27, 2022, 18:47 GMT+2\n\nHi XXXX,\n\nI hope this email finds you well.\n\nMy payments team has informed me that this is actually a known ongoing issue we\'re actively working to resolve.\n\nWe will let you know if there are any relevant updates for you.\n\nHave a great rest of your day and please don\'t hesitate to reach out with any more questions.\nXXX - Customer Support - Wise', 'review_date': '2022-07-31', 'review_time': '15:45:42', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
