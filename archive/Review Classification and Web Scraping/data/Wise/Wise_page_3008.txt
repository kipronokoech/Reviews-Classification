With card payments, there's information traded between the merchant and our system that can sometimes cause payments to fail or to show as pending until the merchant has confirmed the payment to be successful. Due to that, we strongly recommend asking for and keeping any and all receipts from the merchant so our team can take action on our end.\n\nWithout a decline receipt, for example, we wouldn't be able to confirm whether the payment has failed to go through or if the merchant could be taking longer to claim it, due to how card payments are processed.\n\nYou can find more information on this here: https://bit.ly/3eKdtZW as well as by contacting our support team: https://wise.com/help/contact - Even if our phone lines are unavailable, you can always send us an email or try our live chat option instead.\n\nHope this helps,\nWise team", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2021-07-22', 'CompanyReplyTime': '12:54:47'}
