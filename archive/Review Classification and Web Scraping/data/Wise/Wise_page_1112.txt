But after that, we’ll charge you 0.50 GBP/EUR per transaction. This is a fixed fee. If you take out over 200 GBP/EUR in one month, we’ll charge you 1.75% on top of that.\n\nSome ATMs charge their own fees, and they’ll usually say so before you get started. If you see any extra fees, you’ll have the option to cancel and use a different ATM.\n\nBear in mind that if you withdraw cash in a currency you're not currently holding, we'll charge a conversion fee to convert for you. Learn how we do that: https://wi.se/spendmoneywithcard\n\nHere's also a good guide on how to use ATM in Greece: https://wise.com/gb/blog/atms-in-greece\n\nFeel free to contact us with more questions at https://wi.se/contactus_ or on our social media channels.\n\nWise", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2022-09-09', 'CompanyReplyTime': '06:58:06'}

Within a couple of hours I had paid the hotel bill for my upcoming holiday in Cyprus. I bought Euros for a quarter of the cost of getting them at my bank's preferential rate, and the transaction itself took seconds. I have a virtual card on my Apple wallet that I can use seamlessly to purchase goods and services in a currency of my choice. Topping up with Euros or any other currency is intuitive, simple, cheap and quick. When I get back from Cyprus my physical card will have arrived and I will pop that in my physical wallet.\n\nAlso, I had to call the customer service bods for a couple of points of clarification, and they were helpful, polite without being gushing, and very knowledgeable, and they were able to answer my questions clearly and efficiently\n\nI'm looking forward to using my virtual card on holiday.
