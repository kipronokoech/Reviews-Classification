Really you only find out how good a companies customer service is when things go wrong. But after dealing with them a long time they asked for verification and after paying them the feee required and the money amounting to £1500-00 app theuy informed they could not pay this until checks had been carried out which would take at least 5 days which is unaaceptable when I am paying suppliers. Tried phoning them and after 20 mins put the phone down as it was on hold. Finally got someone on theoir chat line after a wait of 15 mins who didnt help much. But promised a call back which I put a 30 min time limit on- guess what nobody called back. So I then sent an e mail to their support line to compalin only to receive an automated reply informing me that the e amil was not monitored and refer me to the help section on the website which is of no help at all. I have since been in touch with a currency exchange provider spoke to a real person straight away who emailed me promptly and said they normally can set up an account within 2 hours sfter going through the checks. I have copied the CEO into my complaints e mail but somehow I am not holding my breath my only other recourse is to wait until Friday which is when they are saying they will transfer to my supplier in Italy if nothing then a call to the bank and have my money returned\nBut avoid this lot if you want customer service because there is not any I do remeber that theold transfer wise were OK so what has gone wrong ?', 'review_date': '2022-05-23', 'review_time': '16:32:56', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

Twice now an urgent payment has been held up for days while "regulatory checks" carried out.

We have already used your service to pay suppliers in the EU yet you don't want to verify our company when you are NOT holding any of our currency? Why is that? So now I have to pay my suppliers directly from my bank or find another wire company whilst I wait the allocated 10 DAYS for my monies to be returned.
