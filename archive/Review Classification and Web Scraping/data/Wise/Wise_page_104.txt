I am currently on an extended business trip in Indonesia, from my home in Japan. Here\'s where the trouble started; since my card is based on Japanese local office employee interpretations of Japanese regulations on money wire/transfer institutions; the Japan Office of Wise decided to "Pause" my transfer. This led to several requests from Wise support teams based wherever, to upload my identity verification documents again. This went on for two weeks, seven document uploads by myself; and still Wise support team sending me email responses to "upload" the documents again.\nFor those of you thinking of getting a Wise card account, I suggest that you ask many many questions about the local country regulations that Wise local staff will interpret and employ , while you\'re left holding an empty wallet. Don\'t believe all those rosey Wise Support Team emails out there on the web.\n\nMy reply to Wise support team comments: Please get your facts correct; Wise is not a registered "financial institution" in Japan.
