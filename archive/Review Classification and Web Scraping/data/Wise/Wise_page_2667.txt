Even before I cancelled the transfer and also after, I contacted Wise help support a few times. They only said my money hasn't reached their account, and that they cannot track it. I have sent them a payment proof from my bank , stating that 4,300 Euros were sent on 08/10. I was supposed to go through a surgery , and because of their bad service I had to postpone it.

If you have used the correct bank details and the correct payment method, your money will reach us, and we'll be able to move forward with your payment.\n\nIf incorrect details were used, your payment will be rejected and sent back to your account, but this isn't a process we can see or speed up from our side. We recommend that you ask your bank to track the payment from their side.\n\nWise.", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2021-11-15', 'CompanyReplyTime': '13:18:47'}

I get paid through PayPal, in a currency other than my home country's currency, and I was constantly in disbelief at the amount of (hidden) fees taken out of each pay by PayPal when I exchanged the currency. Every week, I was losing about $20 in fees, and I'm not someone who makes a lot of money, so that was distressing. Then one day I happened to see a blog mentioning Wise as an alternate money transferring service, and after searching a little bit, I found that it was reputable, so I decided to give it a try.\n\nWow, what a difference. It only costs about $5 in exchange fees versus $20 for the same amount of money. Not only that, but it's way faster than PayPal (PayPal takes at least 1 business day to transfer my money to my bank account, while Wise usually takes just a few hours). I honestly wish everyone knew about Wise, because it could save a lot of people a ton of money, stress, and time.", 'review_date': '2021-10-19', 'review_time': '23:59:30', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
