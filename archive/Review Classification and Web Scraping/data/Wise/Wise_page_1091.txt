However, I recently had a bad experience. My account was deactivated! They wouldn‚Äôt tell me the reason but I knew why. After promising to send me the amount that was on my account Within 10 business days, I had to reach out again because the money never came. They asked me for a bank account in USD and Euros, which I didn‚Äôt have, thus the reason why I used wise. The next customer service rep asked me for a different proof of verification, reactivated my account and changed the information on my profile. After 2 weeks of headache, not having access to my money, one willing person fixed it. My advice is that Wise needs to train their people better. Don‚Äôt just deactivate an account because you didn‚Äôt like the first document used for verification. I understand that verification is very important but customers need to be guided better.

It's normally a result of a conflict with our Terms of Service or Customer Agreement, or due to a discrepancy with a financial law. We can't share the exact reason of the deactivation, due to how we're regulated. However, you can find some possible reasons here wi.se/accountdeactivation.\n\nAs for your remaining money in your account, we'll work on sending it back to you. But first, we need to carry out due diligence checks. While we do that, your money and information will be safe and secure.\n\nYou can always appeal our decision and our team will check your account, which in your case happened already.
