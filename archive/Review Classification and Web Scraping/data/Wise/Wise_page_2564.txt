At first I transferred small quantities which arrived quickly and for cheap just as promised. Since I became comfortable with Wise as they seemed reliable, I decided to transfer around 200 pounds. Rather than being done in seconds which is what it usually takes, the app said that it would take a few hours to verify my transfer. I woke up the next day unable to log in, desperate because my money already left my account. I received no email, text, or call so I called customer service only for them to tell me that wise deactivated my account. Why? I still do not know as customer service does not know the reason and I never received a single email regarding my account deactivation. This company deactivated my account with no warning or communication AND WITHHELD MY MONEY FOR NEARLY A WEEK. I told customer service the money was for my groceries and that I needed to eat, they told me that there was nothing they could do and that I should just wait for the money. Until this point I have received ZERO EMAILS from wise explaining the deactivation or when I received my funds. After a dreadful week with zero communication from wise the money that was stuck in my wise account was suddenly refunded. During this whole process wise NEVER sent me single email telling me why my account was deactivated or the status of my refund. I AM NEVER USING IT AGAIN.', 'review_date': '2021-11-14', 'review_time': '21:47:54', 'CompanyReply': 'Reply from Wise\nDec 21, 2021\nHello, Philippe.\n\nWe understand having your account closed is frustrating, but rest assured this is never done without a reason.
