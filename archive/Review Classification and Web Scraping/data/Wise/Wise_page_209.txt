Because we’re not lending your money we handle it differently, by safeguarding it. Safeguarding means that we look after your money, keep it separate from our own money, and keep it available to you whenever you need it.\n\nSometimes, Wise will cancel your transfer. There are a few reasons why we might do this — here are some of the most common ones: https://wi.se/cancelled_transfer\n\nFurthermore, our support is always here for you. You can call or email us at https://wi.se/contactus_. Or if you find social channels more suitable for you, then we offer support over Facebook, Twitter, Instagram as well.\n\nWise", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2023-07-06', 'CompanyReplyTime': '11:48:24'}
