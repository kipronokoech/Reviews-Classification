This time everything is worse than unacceptable. I have transferred a 6 figure mount to them on the 13/1. The day after they were asking for different ID documents, before they could complete the transfer. I submitted 8 documents, and they would verify within 1-2 days. After 8 days without hearing anything I asked them via chat what was happening, and they needed more time. After 2 more days I asked them, and got the same response. 2 days after the auto-cancelled my payment because they still didn\'t had time to verify the documents. After entering my account number, where the money should be returned to, they again asked for more documents, before they wanted to return the money. I submitted 2 more documents, which was not enough for them. I then submitted again and still they weren\'t satisfied. I tried to contact them 10 times, and same answer, keep asking for more and more documents, that is impossible to get. And at the same time, they have "stolen" my money, and don\'t want to return it until I satisfy their impossible requests. Tried to call/speak to them, but they say, it is not possible. So right now I am stuck..they have a 6 figure amount of mine, that they don\'t want to return to the same bank account they got it from.
