Throughout the whole process of trying to make a first transfer, everything the site said was incredibly vague and unhelpful. Leaving everything to chance, hope, and a prayer is just not acceptable when tens of thousands are on the line. No explanation as to why major banks (including mine) were not on the list for Online Bill Pay, leaving me no way to even pay for their "service." LOL, W.T.F? No info on the site about what happens to fees if the transactions doesn\'t go through. They refused to answer this via email, on Facebook, and on Twitter. Nothing but rudeness and refusal to answer policy questions across the board. Never went through with a transaction. Couldn\'t have even had I wanted to.
