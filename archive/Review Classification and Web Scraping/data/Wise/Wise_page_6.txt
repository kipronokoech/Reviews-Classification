They haven't responded to me in over 7 days, have frozen transfers on my account with ‚Ç¨300 in it. I can't even access my own money and they are avoiding my emails.\n\nI have been polite and patient.\n\nThey don't have an official phone line. I've tried contacting them on Facebook. But honestly, when it comes to withholding my money and they aren't responding - very unsettling.\n\nSome context:\nI was transferring money to myself for the past year. I was living abroad and using it to exchange my money and send it home. I pay all my taxes btw and am actually guine.\n\nThey asked me for proof of identity which I showed them, then they asked for proof of salary. I sell handmade items so it's not an official salary and I'm self employed. I provided bank statements and as much as much docuements as I can including previous text returns. They asked me for more documents, then they then froze my transfers and are now unresponsive.\n\nThey haven't given me a link to send new documents and are now unresponsive.\n\nI have sent them so many personal documents even my tax returns. My own official bank never asks for proof of salary and always responds within an hour. This is seriously worrying.\n\nVery suspicious activity from Wise\nI am concerned as I have sent so much personal information and I now feel Wise is very unreliable to be handling my money especially since customer srrvice doesn't even respond.", 'review_date': '2023-11-01', 'review_time': '05:04:13', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

Just a message saying fees has been debited to other banks (Swift) without details?\nIn the message, he says we have no control over it.\nHow ? you are the one who tracks the movement of money and you informed me that the money had arrived at the beneficiary bank?\nThe question is where did these ‚Ç¨45 fees go and why were they not mentioned in the invoice so that they were clear? . Did you discount it for yourself?

We're sorry to hear that your recipient received less money than intended.\n\nIf you are sending money to a bank account outside its originating currency, we use the SWIFT network. This is a vast messaging network that banks and other financial institutions use for information such as transfer instructions. In this method, usually, several banks involve in the process. You can consider this like travelling with several connecting flights instead of a direct flight.\n\nDuring this process, the correspondent banks might charge their own fees. It's true that we don't have a control over other institutions' fees. That's why when you create a transfer requiring use of SWIFT network, we show you a warning, and let you know that there might be extra fees.\n\nWe also explain this in our Help Center: https://wi.se/swiftpayments\n\nIt looks like our support team was able to assist you on emails. If you have further questions, feel free to get in touch again at https://wi.se/contactus or on Twitter/X, Facebook, or Instagram.\n\nWise", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2023-11-02', 'CompanyReplyTime': '16:05:12'}
