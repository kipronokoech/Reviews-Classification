However, over the last four months they have been harassing me about "verifying my sources of income" eventually blocking my account. I provided a number of documents I consider quite personal (which I was never requested by my local EU-based bank, for example), and they were not enough for Wise. The customer service responds fast but is inept providing generic mindless responses ("because of the way we are regulated in EU..." - as if customers are babies who never dealt with financial institutions before). There is no support chat function and you can\'t even respond to support emails - you need to open a new support request. This prolongs communication and you keep going in circles with no result. Looking at the recent reviews, it is obvious mine is not an isolated case. Enough of this pathetic circus for me and I\'ll be proceeding with closing my accounts at Wise. We\'ll see how long it would now take to get my money stuck at Wise returned - I guess another sad saga is to ensue.\nI now feel embarrassed I recommended Wise to my friends.', 'review_date': '2023-03-06', 'review_time': '23:25:49', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
