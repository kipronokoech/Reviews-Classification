I have filed a complaint with international support and is processing this further. It is totally unacceptable the way they hold on to someones money this long without any explanation. Finally after almost 2 months and several calls and emails later they finally refund me but with a much lower amount. They not only took for ever to refund but also stole money from me in this long process. Very very disappointed of this whole procedure. Simply don't use Wise!!!", 'review_date': '2023-04-05', 'review_time': '16:26:09', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

It's funny how the deactivation happened just after I received a deposit and then made a transfer. The transfer has not been paid and I cannot get information/confirmation on where my funds are and when will i have my funds refunded back to my account!!! I am unable to get hold of a human to discuss my situation, as the whole system is run by bots and emails which all refer to each other through the help process. Even using social media to contact Transferwise is useless as also bots and emails are the communication format.

Your problem solving page does not deal with my problem which is a direct debit which the company has presented to you but it was not paid. The company concerned is the Electricity company of Cyprus. I have the direct debit mandate and I have been to see them twice and they tell me that I have to contact my bank as there is nothing more they can do. I now have to pay it myself on-line which I can do but as far as I am concerned this is a big failure, especially as I have filled in this form twice before and never received a reply. I have one regular payment going to the Bank of Cyprus and one regular payment into Wise from Nat West with no problems so why can't you pay this one. I was hoping to make you my main bank paying all my bills but I find I cannot trust you to do so now. I will be going back to the Bank of Cyprus which I was going to close in favour of Wise but not now.
