I have used wise for over a year as a second bank. It has been ideal for buying things in another country, in their currency and having it shipped within that country. Or treating friends / relatives with food delivery. It works well as a travel card should you opt for the physical card also. However, all is not so rosy. I fell for a scam recently and Wise failed to back me up and refused a cash back request. This left the scammers with my money and a poor reflection on Wise. If you cant trust your bankers, who can you trust. This account is now dormant and they think that's Wise. I could add that a letter or bank statement from a Bank as a form of ID, would not be acceptable if using a Wise account. On test for this review, I checked call answering time for an agent and this was an acceptable 8 minutes.", 'review_date': '2021-11-05', 'review_time': '10:44:19', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
