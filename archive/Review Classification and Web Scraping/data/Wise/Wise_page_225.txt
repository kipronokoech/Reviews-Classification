I have used this account for five years (from when they were Transferwise) and have always been pleased with them. I both receive and pay out money in many currencies and whilst I notice that for my US clients it's a bit more complicated (mainly as US banking is not as advanced as European banking, one of the few areas where their technology lags), I have to say my experience has always been positive. When I have rung, I haven't had any issues getting through to customer service. I work in travel, so I know how much value people place in reviews. I therefore just felt compelled to talk about my positive experience. We, as humans, are naturally more disposed to leave a review about a negative than a positive experience, but I wanted to assure people considering Wise that mine has been a positive experience!", 'review_date': '2023-06-23', 'review_time': '16:01:39', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
