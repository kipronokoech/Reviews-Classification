As I am an interpreter I work for different agencies from different countries, so I have payments from different countries. I sent them POs and Invoices that they consider not a proof, Bank Statements from my home bank they dont accept, even an employment contract for a 10 days assignment now in July, but they dont accept it since the 10 days are over. Result: My account is blocked, the money is blocked, and they have 40 days to decide what they will do. Anytime, they just can block your account, they are not willing to understand what I am doing and they still ask the same question. Probably it is a good account if you are an employee, but their customer friendliness is really below 0. The other banks I work with have no trouble understanding my job. Personally, I dont recommend Wise anymore.', 'review_date': '2023-08-21', 'review_time': '01:51:59', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nAug 21, 2023\nHi David,\n\nAs a regulated financial institution, we are committed to ensuring the safety and compliance of our platform, and we don't block accounts without a reason. Requesting documents such as your source of wealth is a standard procedure, and a regulatory requirement for some regions.\n\nWe're very precise about the documents we need, as they are essential for us to verify your account properly. Without the right info, we can't really go ahead. More info here: https://wi.se/sow\n\nIf your account was deactivated, we understand how this could be frustrating, but rest assured this is never done without a reason. We ever only close accounts that are being used in a way that goes against our Terms of Use: https://wi.se/customeragreement\n\nIf you think a mistake was made, you can appeal our decision following the guidelines here: https://wi.se/accountdeactivation. We’ll review your request and get back to you ASAP via email.\n\nAs for the remaining money in your account, we'll work on sending it back to you. But first, we need to carry out due diligence checks. While we do that, your money and information will be safe and secure.\n\nWise", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2023-08-21', 'CompanyReplyTime': '07:12:29'}
