This happened to me last week and they held my 1000 EUR for the whole week before I managed to get it back after sending them various documents including investment account statements, trading history or tax return. Customer support is horrendous with long response times, lot of incompetence and copied answers. Whole process is very stressful and I would advice everyone to leave with their money from the platform. This is a joke not a financial service with European standard. I\'m never coming back and I will actively advice everyone who\'ll ever ask me to not use wise.
