As a regulated financial institution, we have stringent security measures in place to prevent scams and fraudulent activities on our platform. Our commitment is to provide a safe and reliable service.\n\nIt appears that you might have fallen victim to a phishing attempt. We've put together some resources to help you address this situation: https://wi.se/phishinghelp\n\nHere are some steps you can consider taking:\n\n- If you've sent any packages, it's crucial to get in touch with the shipping company immediately to halt the delivery and potentially recover your items.\n- In case you've transferred money, reach out to your bank and request a recall of the payment. It's also advisable to contact the financial institution that received the funds and ask them to investigate the recipient's bank account.\n\nReporting the scammer's profile on the marketplace/platform where you conducted your transactions (like Facebook or Gumtree) is highly recommended.\n\nAdditionally, filing a police report and collaborating with local authorities can aid in addressing this scam effectively. If the need arises, we're more than willing to cooperate with law enforcement to provide any relevant information.\n\nIf you've received suspicious emails, make sure to report the email address to your email provider as well.\n\nRemember, we're here to support you. If you require further assistance, you can always get in touch with us directly at: https://wi.se/directcontactus.

I have uploaded all documents requested two days ago despite their system not working (yes, it took them 7 days to request info) however I've been informed that it will take another 7-10 days to complete. Meanwhile, a bank loan payment has defaulted due to frozen funds which has destroyed my credit score. Furthermore, Wise Bank are destroying my business as I cannot pay creditors nor except payments from debtors. Wise Bank are evil.\n\nI have now written to the Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS) to make a formal complaint. If you have the same or a similar issue then I recommend that you do the same by contacting the UK Financial Ombudsman. I can't provide a link due to this site's rules however I suggest that you google to find their site. Making a complaint is simple and straightforward and takes circa five minutes only.\n\nI will also write to the Chamber of Commerce and the Institute of Directors regarding the conduct of Wise Bank. If they do not clean up their act then they should be closed down.\n\nIf you are currently a business customer of Wise Bank who is not experiencing any problems and leaving positive reviews then well done. Based on my experience, it is likely only a matter of time before you experience the pain and frustration of choosing Wise Bank like myself and so many other Wise Bank customers.\n\nFinally, below is the ‘usual’ response from Wise which is an insult to intelligence. There is no acceptable reason for taking several days to do compliance checks whilst freezing a banking account. It is abundantly clear to Wise that they do terrible damage to both individuals and businesses. It is utterly harmful and destructive. All KYC, compliance and due diligence checks should be conducted BEFORE the account is opened as all other professional commercial banks do, not after whilst in use. There is no acceptable excuse.
