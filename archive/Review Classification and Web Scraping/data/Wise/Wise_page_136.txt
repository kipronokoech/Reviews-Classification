We can't always share the exact reason for the deactivation, due to how we're regulated.\n\nIf you think a mistake was made, you can appeal our decision following the guidelines here: https://wi.se/accountdeactivation. When you make the appeal, you'll also be able to add your account details for the refund. We’ll review your request and get back to you ASAP via email.\n\nAs for the remaining money in your account, we'll work on sending it back to you.

THEY JUST CLOSED MINE WHILE ABROAD, leaving me with no money in a foreign country. As you can see here or on google, happens all the time to MANY, MANY people. They are super responsive here on negative comments, but not when you send 10 emails asking where your money are. They always say that they never close accounts without reasons, but when you ask what was the reason, they won't tell you that. It is like if you are stopped by the police and they want to confiscate your license because you did not obey the law, but when you ask what exactly did you do, they won't respond. They will also say that your money are safe, but how can they be if they are not in my pocket, where they belong? They will be safe once you give them back to me. In the meantime, they are confiscated and kept as hostage without any clue to when i will get them back. THIS IS CALLED STEALING. In case anybody wonder why they got to a point where they needed to close my account, here is the story to make you understand that nothing, NOTHING was irregular. After 2 years of using it while travelling, 2 weeks ago they asked for proof of funding and incomes which i gave ( bank statements, invoices, tax return and literally everything i had) but apparently was not enough for them. YES, you heard me right, they kept refusing my legit statements from actual Banks (they are not a bank btw) and even the tax i paid to the government!! And instead of saying, look, we need something more, or look, you can't use our service anymore, so you need to move your funds, NO, they send me an email saying: your account has been closed. NOW you can only appeal.\nI appealed of course, but they won't respond anymore so you don't know when you are going to get your money back. And while this is happening, they earn interests on your funds but you are left without your OWN money.

We are a regulated financial institution, and our priority is to ensure the safety and legitimacy of transactions for all our customers.\n\nFrom time to time, we do request certain documents that prove how you earn your money. This is to comply with regulations aimed at preventing money laundering and ensuring the security of your funds. Our requirements may vary based on different regions and circumstances. If your documents weren't accepted, it's possible that they might have been missing some specific information that we needed. You can find more details on what we're looking for in these documents here: https://wi.se/sow.\n\nWe want to assure you that account closures are not carried out lightly. We only take such steps when an account is being used in a way that goes against our Terms of Use: https://wi.se/customeragreement\n\nIf you've already appealed by following these guidelines https://wi.se/accountdeactivation, rest assured that we'll thoroughly review your case and respond ASAP via email.\n\nAs for the remaining money in your account, we'll work on sending it back to you. But first, we need to carry out due diligence checks. While we do that, your money and information will be safe and secure. We also assure you that we don't earn interests out of holding your money.\n\nSince you mention being abroad, we understand the urgency of the situation, so we've escalated your case to the relevant team. They'll reach out to you as soon as there's an update.\n\nShould you need help, please reach out to us here: https://wi.se/contactus (click on “Trouble logging in?”, and then on “Something else” to see our phone and email details), or contact us on Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram with your registered email address.\n\nWise", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2023-08-11', 'CompanyReplyTime': '07:28:01'}
