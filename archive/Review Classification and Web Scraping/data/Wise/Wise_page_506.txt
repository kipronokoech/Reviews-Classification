They said they send transfers to Japan. When I went to make my first purchase from a fashion boutique my transfer was rejected because the business name was "wrong". I wasn\'t able to copy/paste the Kanji lettering into the business name on the website like I was told I should be able to. When I took a screenshot of the website showing that only Latin lettering was able to be used and sent it in an e-mail they would just repeat that I can use Katakana and would give the bullet points from the FAQ about transfers to Japan. Katakana uses Kanji lettering, it is impossible to use Katakana without using Kanji. The ignorance was astounding and not even acknowledging the website STILL SAID LATIN LETTERING ONLY. This is false advertising saying you can transfer to Japanese banks when you can only use Latin lettering in the business name type space. I am closing out my account as soon as possible. I do not recommend this company to anyone, their customer service is the worst I have ever experienced.\n\nEdit after their response: Their response is false. I have a screenshot of their website *NOT* using Katakana lettering. I SENT THE SCREENSHOT TO THEM and they ignored it for three e-mails. Ironically after I told them I was closing my account they asked for a screenshot of the problem. After I had already sent it proving they do not read the e-mails.', 'review_date': '2023-02-01', 'review_time': '00:14:58', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nJan 31, 2023\nHello, Sinley\n\nWe appreciate your honest feedback and are sorry for the trouble you've been having. With transfer to Japan we most definitely accept Katakana letters, it's even a requirement that with all transfer the recipient's name hast to match 100% to the bank records for the money to go through.\nOne more reason for the bounce bank is that the account type also needs to be correct.\n\nWe're happy to help you more at https://wi.se/contactus_ or on our social media channels.\n\nWise", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2023-01-31', 'CompanyReplyTime': '09:45:11'}
