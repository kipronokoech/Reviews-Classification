For no reason at all my account was deactivated. I have provided proof of every single transaction made, in and out of the account, and I had over ¬£28,000 in the account. Yet TransferWise refused to activate my account, and give no reason whatsoever why they closed it initially. I will be letting the financial ombudsman know about this if it is not rectified soon!! This is just a huge SCAM and I have no idea why the FCA have regulated them!! It appears I am not the only one in this position as well.', 'review_date': '2020-10-27', 'review_time': '09:23:24', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nOct 13, 2020\nHello, Darren\n\nWe understand account deactivation can be stressful and upsetting. TransferWise will never close an account without considering the seriousness of this decision. With this, we can't disclose why an account has been deactivated but some reasons range from duplicate accounts to a discrepancy with a financial law.\n\nOnce the account is closed, any pending transfers are refunded. Before we can return any remaining balances, we must complete due diligence checks as required by financial law. This can take up to 60 working days but our appeals team will keep you updated along the way so keep a lookout for an email from us.\n\nRegards,\nThe TransferWise Team", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2020-10-13', 'CompanyReplyTime': '15:19:44'}
