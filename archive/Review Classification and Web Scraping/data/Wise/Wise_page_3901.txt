However, this is not the case when you're not sending local currency- as we'd have to use the SWIFT network for that. This is an option we offer for few currencies.\n\nIn your example, seems like you might have sent EUR to Albania. This would have been done via SWIFT method and we'll always notify our users of that, when your receiving country doesn't match the currency. More information here:https://transferwise.com/help/articles/2968916.\n\nIn such cases, your money will move through the international network, which means that banks who move your funds might have their own charges. This is something we're simply not able to predict from our end.\n\nHope this helps, but if any further questions. reach out at:https://transferwise.com/help/contact and we'd be happy to assist.\n\nBest wishes,\nTransferWise Team", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2020-11-03', 'CompanyReplyTime': '12:22:27'}
