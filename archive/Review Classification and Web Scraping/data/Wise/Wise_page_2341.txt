This can be from 24h to 4 days. Mean if the final currency value is rising after the transfer request, they seem keeping on hold the transfer and the received money as much as possible to gain from the biggest difference of the guaranteed rate and the actually better rate on the transfer day. If the currency is falling the transfers are done sometimes in 24 hours.\nIt\'s dirty bank business as usual, unfortunately for the customer. So be aware; make the transfer when the final currency value starts falling.\nOtherwise WISE seems still one of the best alternatives.\nUpdate 2022: After inquiry about my revenues and a lot of private info I decided to close my account at Wise. Meantime I find out that with a "little" less good exchange rate I have more secure and safer transfer conditions with my local bank and all the time within 48h or less.
