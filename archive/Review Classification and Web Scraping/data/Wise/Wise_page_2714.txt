Transfer to Brazil via proxy bank or tranfers at all via a proxy bank is a nightmare.

The support team from Wise doesn't read my documents and mails also. Chat is friendly but doesn't solve the issue. This is really disappointing especially because it worked fine in the past. But there ist no way to talk to someone or get in contact directly. Seems I need to find someone else who provides better service.\n\nThe answer doesn't explain a lot. Extra checks are fine but does that mean that you need the same documents over and over again? Or just ask for the same documents again and again without reading?\nI guess no.

This is a routine procedure to help us ensure we‚Äôre keeping our platform safe for everyone using (including you) while complying with local regulations.\n\nDo keep in mind, we always make sure to update you along the way, and you‚Äôll know the status of your transfer at all times.\n\nWise.', 'CompanyReplyDate': '2021-10-29', 'CompanyReplyTime': '11:34:29'}
