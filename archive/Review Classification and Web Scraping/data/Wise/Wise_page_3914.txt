We mark your transfer Complete when we’ve sent the money to the recipient bank. And we leave a little room in our arrival estimate for the bank to process and release it.\n\nBut some banks are slower than others — they might take up to 1 working day for them to release the money. So your money’s safely on its way, but the recipient bank is still processing it. Your recipient can ask their bank to speed this up. They’ll need a transfer receipt that has all the details.\n\nYou can read more about it here -> https://transferwise.com/help/articles/2977950\n\nIf you want us to take a closer look at your transfer, please feel free to reach us by using this link -> wi.se/contactus and we'll do that right away.\n\nThanks\n\nJoao", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2020-10-27', 'CompanyReplyTime': '13:49:21'}

So, she sent a photo of the transfer confirmation to Transferwise through her account. Later, she was asked to upload a copy of her ID (that she had already provided 24hr earlier).\nThen the interface rejected every photo she made of her ID or passport. Without a reason.

We're working on making money transfers borderless, and verification is one of the ways we keep your business’s money safe and comply with the financial regulations in the countries that we operate in.\n\nRequests for additional information can come at any time during a financial transaction. We do our best to get all of this out of the away ahead of your transfer, but if requested by our partner or partner bank, we must comply and ask for the additional details whenever they ask.\n\nYou can read more about our verification procedures here -> https://wi.se/verifyyourid\n\nIt's hard to give you an answer here without seeing the case itself. Please, get in touch with us by using this link -> wi.se/contactus, and our team will check your case in detail.\n\nThanks\n\nJoao", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2020-10-27', 'CompanyReplyTime': '13:48:10'}
