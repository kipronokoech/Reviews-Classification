However, this simpler structure came at the cost, and would have made our card product more expensive to maintain in the long-term.\n\nHowever, we decided to change it back to how it was before, and now you can still make 2 cash withdrawals up to {200 GBP} each month for free. We charge {0.5 GBP} per additional withdrawal, and there‚Äôs a 1.75% fee on any amount you withdraw above {200 GBP}.\n\nWe apologize for the inconvenience this may have caused and will continue to work on making our fees cheaper when spending.\n\nThank you for bearing with us.\n\nWise', 'CompanyReplyDate': '2023-01-20', 'CompanyReplyTime': '08:09:13'}

Still my bank managed to transfer the money at 11th jan 20:35 UTC, yet Wise disagreed to pay me my guaranteed rate. On raising concern they continuously lied that they didn't receive the money on time and never gave a proof of when their bak received the money. This is their business model to cheat your money, because for a small amount people will just let it be but for a 70 yrs old like me its still an uncomfortable amount that they took away from m. Their support service is robotic and though I sent them the proof that I had sent the money within time they kept hiding behind customer agreement and a lame statement that my transfer was late.
