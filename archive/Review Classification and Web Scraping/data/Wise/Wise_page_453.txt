Used it a few times and kind of forgot about it.\n\nNow that I moved abroad and might use their service more I checked out my account. Few weeks ago, it appeared, 2 credit card checks were made followed by 2 attempts to take a payment by a well known website I have no interest in to visit. Payment was declined as there was no funds in the account.\n\nThe issue is that these transaction attempts could take place without me getting any notification, before or after the attempts. As it appears the payment might have gone through if I had left money in the accounts.\n\nI informed Support and they got back with a rather draft reply: "investigating and blocked \'the card\'".\n\nWhen I asked which card was blocked, the plastic or the virtual one, no reply was received after 4 days.\n\nI checked and figured out that the attempts were made using the details of the virtual card. Those card details still appeared even after I had informed Support online of what I had discovered. I hence next destroyed those details myself and assume it was the plastic card (that wasn\'t exposed in the attempt) that was blocked by Support.\n\nAll very worrying. Other banks ask for verification of transactions by way of text message, using an Authenticator App or by having to log into their own app on a mobile phone etc.\n\nWise did not do any of this. If there had been money in the account it like had been gone and for as long as I had not logged in I would not have been notified of any of this, Appalling. The follow up by Support is inadequate and evenly worrying.', 'review_date': '2023-03-14', 'review_time': '18:39:13', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
