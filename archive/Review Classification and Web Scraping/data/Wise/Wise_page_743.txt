This isn't something we take lightly. It's normally a result of a conflict with our Terms of Service or Customer Agreement, or due to a discrepancy with a financial law. We can't always share the exact reason for the deactivation, due to how we're regulated.\n\nHowever, you can find some possible reasons here wi.se/accountdeactivation.\n\nOn this link, you can also find which steps you can take next and refund details (in case you have remaining balances).\n\nRest assured, we're not ignoring you.

If you have shipped any items, please urgently contact the shipping company and cancel the shipment. They might be able to stop the delivery and recover your goods.\n\n2. Do not send any funds to suspicious bank accounts provided by that email sender. If you have sent money somewhere, please reach out to your bank and request a recall. It is also worth it to contact the financial institution you sent money to and request them to investigate the recipient’s bank account.\n\n3. We strongly encourage you to report the scammer’s profile to the marketplace/platform you are using to make your sales (i.e. Facebook or Gumtree).\n\n4. To file a police report and communicate local authorities about this scam. If the police get in touch, Wise will happily provide info about what happened. Please share with authorities: fake wise email address, any fraudulent bank details, address where you shipped goods to, scammer’s profile on marketplace, and any other information about the scam.\n\nOur security team can investigate the suspicious message you received. For that, please forward to phishing@wise.com a screenshot and the full original copy of the fraudulent email with headers - how to get it, depends on the mail provider that you use, see: https://support.google.com/mail/answer/29436.\n\nHope this gets sorted for you ASAP, but if you need anything else, don't hesitate to reach out: https://wi.se/contactus_\n\nWise.", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2022-11-23', 'CompanyReplyTime': '12:08:32'}
