The last was a fed wire from US bank to Wise, confirmed received by Wise but never appears in the client account. I had to beg for help and send 5 emails and 3 calls. CS won\'t say anything. "Ten working days for regulatory checks and we can\'t say anything else. We can\'t talk to you, we can\'t tell the sender anything either" I ask, do you have my wire? CS says "yes". How much I ask. "We can\'t see that in Customer Service." Will my money go to my account or is there a risk it will be returned? CS says "It could be returned but why would that be a problem? Ask your sender to use another method?" OMG, these people are brain dead at Wise. They believe your money is their money. Absolutely no customer care at all. My sense after two years and lots of problems is it is only about skimming the overnight float. You have no recourse, no information and no rights to ask. Wise points you solely to the terms and conditions and says "tough luck". My bank sucks at $40 per xfer but they do it in an hour and treat me like a customer. Fed wires are designed for quick and reliable transfer of funds. Avoid Wise at all costs especially for anything over $100. I\'m still waiting for a fed wire three days later and it will be another 7 days with the holiday I\'m told but it might not actually be credited. My sender thinks I\'m scamming.
