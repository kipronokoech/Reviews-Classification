We have been using this for nearly 7 years but now it's very slow. Wise now takes days to process a transfer & it continously asks to reauthenticate account. Then the transfer doesn't work. Just most recent account I processed a payment via WISE Wednesday the 20th; the money withdrew from my account Friday the 22nd but I still haven't received my transfer Monday the 25th. I use WISE to send money from my US account to my UK account for bills etc. With this delay it risks being late to pay bills. I had to unfortunately pay a higher fee to use my debit card just to ensure there was enough to cover bills until WISE sends the money they already have into my UK account. This happened just a few weeks ago when I was trying to make a large transfer to pay for my children's tuition & it wouldn't transfer but suddenly it worked the next day without an issue. The inconsistencies are irritating & worrisome. Hoping it gets better but might have to consider finding an alternative method.", 'review_date': '2022-04-25', 'review_time': '09:26:38', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
