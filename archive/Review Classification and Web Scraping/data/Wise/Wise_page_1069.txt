Your transfer was sent out via SWIFT, which means it's an international transfer.\nBear in mind that your recipient’s bank may charge fees to receive payments sent with SWIFT. In addition, the recipient might be charged by any banks that handle the money along the way. We don’t have control over when these fees are charged, or how much they cost.\n\nMore info here on SWIFT payments: https://wi.se/swiftpayments_\n\nWise", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2022-09-19', 'CompanyReplyTime': '10:17:32'}

Once these checks are completed, we always get in touch about the refund.\n\nDue diligence checks are conducted to verify the information you have provided to us and we are required to do these at all stages of the customer relationship, not just during the initial onboarding stage, so this means during the customer relationship as well as during the deactivation stage.\n\nIf it has been longer than 60 working days, please reach us at https://wi.se/contactus_.
