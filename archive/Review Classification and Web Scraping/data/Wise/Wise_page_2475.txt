I have only three quibbles with it, one of which may not be within its control:\n\n1. It's not clearly stated what the daily transfer limits are. I tried to make a £2,775 payment to a U.K. freelancer and was blocked from doing so by debit card transaction, with no explanation. I had to contact customer service chat to learn that there's a $2,000 daily limit on debit card transactions.\n\n2. Wise won't let me make debit card transfers with my business debit card. I don't know whether this restriction is imposed by Wise or by my bank. It's a little annoying always to have to transfer funds from my business checking account to a personal checking account before sending the funds through Wise.\n\n3. When I'm sending an overseas payment with a fixed U.S. dollar value and want to pay the transaction fee myself, it often takes a few tries to figure out exactly how much I should be paying in U.S. dollars to ensure that my recipient is getting the full exchange amount. Tweaking the amount requires canceling each transaction in which the amount is off, and now Wise warns that fees may go up if I often cancel transactions. If that's going to be the case, then Wise needs to make it easier to change the transfer amount without having to cancel the entire transaction and start over.", 'review_date': '2021-12-05', 'review_time': '22:41:58', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

There are sending and receiving (deposit) limitations which are not publicly stated. My question to help desk: "send me link with limits."; Help desk answer: "Unfortunately, this information is not on our help page". In addition, as I was charged more then expected and after some time they simply stopped solving my complaint. Help desk can manage only simple questions you can anyhow find by yourself in FAQ.

We also have a pricing page, where you can simulate a payment at:https://wi.se/ourfees_.\n\nWhen it comes to sending out money, we'll always use different banking partners for doing that, which can vary depending on the route.\n\nOur sending limits also depend on the currency, but you can always check them out by clicking on the relevant one at:https://wise.com/help/articles/2571907/what-currencies-can-i-send-to-and-from.\n\nYou should also be able to connect your Wise account with your Paypal, and use Paypal as a payment method when sending from EUR.
