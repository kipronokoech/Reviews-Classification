From our side, we can't cancel a direct debit that was authorized between you and the merchant.

Wise has closed my account without any previous notice and now I can't access any of my money. I am desperate as I am traveling and just travel low on cash as most places get cards. I AM STUCK AND WISE HAS RUINED MY COMPLETE TRIP! Be careful, they are similar to regular banks just with a nice UI.
