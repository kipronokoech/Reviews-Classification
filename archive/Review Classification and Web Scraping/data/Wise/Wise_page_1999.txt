I moved it to them via Sofort (a service in Germany similar to bank transfer), and then they sent me an email telling me that Sofort contacted them saying they (i.e. Sofort) cancelled the transfer and that I need to resend them the money. I told Transferwise this did not happen as the money was withdrawn from my account. A few days later they said the money has arrived after a delay. Clearly, they were lying to me when they said that Sofort cancelled the transfer.\n\nThis of course is in addition to the fact that, whenever I transfer money through them, it can take up to two weeks, as they do prolonged checks for people with Muslim or non-White names.\n\nAlthough I have read many reviews basically saying the same thing I am saying, I have decided to write this review to reinforce the other comments and as a warning to potential new Muslim or non-White customers of what to expect from this company. It is quite clear, however, that Transferwise simply will not care since the majority of their income is from White customers and they are legally accountable in chiefly White jurisdictions.\n\nEdit: I am sure it applies to everyone equally.\n\nEdit: Incidentally, instead of misspelling my name, you could have copied and pasted it, in the same way you copied and pasted this rubbish standard answer.', 'review_date': '2022-04-30', 'review_time': '12:25:28', 'CompanyReply': 'Reply from Wise\nApr 29, 2022\nHello Muhammad,\n\nWhile our goal is to complete all payments as fast as we can, we‚Äôre a regulated financial institution and as such, we need to carry extra checks on transfers from time to time.
