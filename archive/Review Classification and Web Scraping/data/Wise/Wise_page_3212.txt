There are options given and the process is very logical. What I don't like is the enormous high fees that Wise has started using for any transfer over about 1000$.

Once decided, there are a few options for payment and there are clear indications how long the transfer will take with each option. The website does communicate with email for each step of the process until the amount has reached the receiver on the other side.
