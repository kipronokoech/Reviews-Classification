{'platform': 'Wise', 'id': '64bbbabb9e79a4cabfe7ba27', 'stars': 1, 'title': 'One Of Many Victims Of Wises Frivolous Account Deactivation. MONEY RETURNED IN 27 DAYS!!!!!', 'message': 'I had an extremely negative experience with Wise money transfer company. This was my very first time ever doing a transaction with this app, and it never went through. My account was pending in limbo for two days, and then they shut down my account previously and then deactivated it frivolously. I had ¬£4040 in this account I feel like I was used as a scapegoat. On the 25th of June 2023, I signed an appeal for a refund, which stated that the refund would be processed within 2-3 days, Then 3-5 days, then within 30 days check your spam. However, it is now the 17th of July and I have yet to receive my refund.\n\nBy failing to process my refund within the stated time frame of 2-3 days, this company has already breached their contract with me. This has caused me significant inconvenience and stress, as I am unable to access my funds or receive any updates on the status of my refund. Furthermore, their customer service has been unhelpful, as I have only been able to communicate with a bot that provides generic responses.\n\nThis company, Wise, has breached their contract by holding my money for so many days. There are over 13,400+ other victims of this senseless deactivation of accounts on FB, which appears to be an attempt by the company to make more interest off our funds. It appears that when they do shut down your account, whether it‚Äôs verified with ID, if it is due diligence checks, if its regulatory checks, slow transfer times, or closing it, it is all designed to make money. I feel that Wise uses their verification process as a means to hold people back and delay their verification. This can result in accounts being shut down. I believe this is done for interest and commission purposes. Wise breached 25.1 of their agreement by not giving notice and 25.4 was breached as they should give a reason for deactivation or suspension.\n\nIn my opinion, it seems like this company may have taken my money only for interest and commission. This is unacceptable and goes against our rights as consumers under UK consumer protection laws, including the Consumer Rights Act 2015, the Consumer Protection Act 1987, and the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008. These laws exist to protect consumers from unfair or misleading business practices, such as holding onto our money for an unreasonable amount of time without providing a valid reason.\n\nAfter calling the complaints department I pleaded for redress on 19th for the fact that my brother had Multiple disabilities I am his carer and my children were hungry, just the hardship, I begged them to let me go as I felt that they had made enough interest off me already, I finally received my refund on the 20th. However, it should not have taken this long or required such extreme measures for me to receive what was rightfully mine. I consider myself lucky to have received my refund in this time frame of 27 days, as many people don‚Äôt get their money back or it takes them months or years to see their money again. Some will result in legal action. I have reported them to the FCA.\n\nIt is unacceptable for a company to take someone‚Äôs money and not return it in a timely manner. Let alone keep it. I personally got no service from Wise just a deactivated account. And left to feel like a criminal. I would not recommend using this company for money transfers and hope that they take significant strides to improve their refund processing times.\n\nIt‚Äôs important for Wise to strike a balance between efficiency and personalization in their customer service interactions to provide the best experience for their customers. Using generic copy and paste messages in customer service can be seen as outdated and inefficient, and can create a barrier between the customer and the support they need. If you need to contact their complaints department, you can find their telephone number on the FCA website, as they do not advertise it on their own website. I also have concerns about discrimination and bias Wise as a company displays towards people with Muslim ,Asian & African names or those from developing countries Have reported delays in receiving there money.\n\nI want to warn other potential customers about the stress and inconvenience that I experienced while dealing with this company. It was very distressful and I don‚Äôt want anyone else to suffer like I did. Please be cautious when considering using this company‚Äôs services. As I do not think they are a transparent company and they do not take accountability.\n\nAnd I got no notification once my money was returned. As Wise has no integrity towards their customers. And I see them as unfair and exploitative. In my opinion, they are a deceptive company and to put your business or personal account in their hands you will suffer immensely and have damaging effects', 'review_date': '2023-07-24', 'review_time': '10:02:37', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
