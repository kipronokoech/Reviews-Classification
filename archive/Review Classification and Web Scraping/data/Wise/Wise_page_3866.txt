Then I found TransferWise and I’m sooo happy that I found this because I don’t have to pay for the card and owning a bank account. The only thing I have to pay are the fees when I’m changing my currency from Euro to GBP, which is not high at all. Also I think TransferWise offers me the best exchange rate which is amazing!!! I hope they won’t change anything, because it’s perfect how it is right now!', 'review_date': '2020-11-06', 'review_time': '07:37:30', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

My wife and I both had our wages deposited in and we used the account for everything! It was easy to send money home and was cheaper and easier than setting up a local account.\n\nI’ve found their customer service to be good. The main issue I saw in the negative reviews was people sending money to the wrong account and it getting tied up for a while. I’ve always been careful to check details and have never had a problem. I’ve transferred about $100,000 Aud through my accounts with them (travelling around Europe and working overseas) and have had far fewer issues than I’ve had with other conventional banks in that same period.\n\nCannot recommend them enough.', 'review_date': '2020-11-06', 'review_time': '04:43:17', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
