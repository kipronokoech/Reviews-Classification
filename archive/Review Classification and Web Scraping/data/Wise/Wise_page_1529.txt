Wouldn't recommend at all.\nI transferred rent to my housing company, the money left my account but was held by Wise because they needed to 'investigate' the transfer. This is my monthly rent. The reference has my name in it and the word rent. The amount is perfectly normal for rent. However, because the money had actually LEFT MY ACCOUNT I couldn't just repeat the transfer. This made me late paying rent which puts my whole life at risk! This happened TWICE!! Customer service is positively unhelpful informing that I have to wait 7-14 BUSINESS DAYS (!) for this 'review' to take place. I asked to speak to a manager and was put into the hold loop until a regular case worker picked up who told me managers don't take calls.\nWhat I suspect is that -because the money is off my account but also not in my housing agents account- Wise holds the money in a third virtual space and is profiting in net value from these 'random' checks. Whatever they do, the fact that MY money leaves my account, doesn't reach the destination and I have no access to it for 7-14 DAYS(!!!) is absolutely shady!\nNever will I use this bank again.", 'review_date': '2022-06-24', 'review_time': '17:38:15', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
