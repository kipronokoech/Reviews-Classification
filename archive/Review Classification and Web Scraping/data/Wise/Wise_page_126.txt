So the courtesy of wise to "reopen" my account for me to start using is out of context and unacceptable as I do not want to use wise again.\n\nSecond, I already submitted selfie of myself with my ID and wrote Wise on a piece of paper when I sent in my appeal to wise to send my refund, so I will not have to do again the second time considering the fact that wise has specified in the email that the information is to "reopen" my account in which at this point, I do not want wise to reopen my account because I do not want to ever use wise again.\n\nI have contacted wise both on call and through email explaining to them that the clause on the email saying they want to "reopen" my account is not acceptable as I do not want to use wise again.\n\nPlease note, you don\'t have to "reopen" a deactivated account again before you process refund to the owner as such statement is not written on wise website, wise wrote this statement "If you still have money in your wise balances when we close your account, we will work on sending it to you".\n\nThis means that I only need to submit an appeal to get my money back from Wise which I already did.\n\nI am not asking wise to reopen my account because I will not use it again, and wise doesn\'t state in their website that when an account is deactivated, wise would need to "reopen" deactivated accounts before returning money to the owner.\n\nTherefore my stand is that I do not want my account to be reopened again, I only need my money which I already submitted an appeal for that.\n\nTo resolve this matter, I want my wise account to remain closed, I only need my money to be refunded to me which I already sent an appeal and provided my refund details to wise.\n\nPlease refer to ticket number 28782828 and read more about my story, also I\'ve spoken with different wise staff on phone with my decision that I don\'t want to use wise again, hence there is no point of reopening my account before refunding my money as that is not stated in wise website.\n\nBecause of this, I am not going to submit this information because I already submitted the same information and I am not asking for wise to reopen my account, I am only for my money.\n\nSo Since wise has specified that the information is for them to reopen my wise account again, I am requesting wise to keep the wise account closed that I do not ever want to use wise again, I only need the refund of the money that was in my account which I already provided with information to wise.\n\nIf for whatever reason wise need the information to process my refund to me, they should use the first one I submitted which was successfully submitted to wise to send my refund.\n\nI want this to be escalated to the highest hierarchy of wise so that some staff of wise can be retrained.\n\nI need my money which you stolen back', 'review_date': '2023-08-17', 'review_time': '09:04:59', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nAug 28, 2023\nHi there,\n\nWe understand you don't want to have your account reopened, and are only interested in the refund from the remaining balance.\n\nWhen accounts are deactivated, we'll work on sending the remaining money in your account back to you.
