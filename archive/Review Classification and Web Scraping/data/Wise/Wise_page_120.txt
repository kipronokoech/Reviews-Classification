Obviously not from the circus that they are running.\n\nI am never using wise again after dealing a frozen account. This has also just happened to my partner. Large transfers, low fees and less stress” yeah right!!! They froze my account for transferring some friends some owed money from dinners and tickets. I then had to “verify” my account with payslips which I uploaded two and got denied, a tax return which was denied and then 3 months of bank statements. Do you think I can be bothered dealing with this while travelling?????\n\nI couldn’t add any money to my wise or pay people back who were covering my costs while they had frozen my account for 2 days.\n\nIf verification is needed for cards to work, this should be done before the card is issued so customers don’t have to worry about it when on holiday. It is hard to access such documents.\n\nAlso the sms text to verify transfers? Lol most people have overseas sims with different numbers….
