I use to be able to easily transfer money to my son in the Netherlands. But then Wise started making all kinds of ridiculous changes and pretended it was 'For My Protection'. All they really did was made things much harder for me. I had to get a second bank account so I can try each one to see if Wise will actually do the transfer. I tried to contact them about my problems they are not very available. When Wise works it works great. Wise is head and shoulders above any other money transfer services. It's quick and they do not charge nearly as much as others. DO NOT USE Western Union. Use Wise.
