They meant that anyone could receive Euros for free, straight to their Wise account. However, weâ€™ve noticed that some banks and merchants around the world donâ€™t always accept Wise IBANs. Rest assured, this isnâ€™t just a problem that Wise faces. Itâ€™s a concern for people across all of Europe. But itâ€™s illegal.\n\nMerchants are required by EU law to accept IBANs from other member states of European Economic Area (EEA). If they don't, you can report them to the relevant authority in your country.\n\nHere's what you can do, when your bank doesn't accept your IBAN: https://wise.com/gb/blog/iban-discrimination\n\nWise", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2022-10-23', 'CompanyReplyTime': '19:06:09'}
