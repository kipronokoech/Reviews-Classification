It used to be convenient and good value for money. However, now they are very poor. Our payments to their USA bank details are often rejected. When I contact customer service which used to be good, you get the following message:\n\n"Our support team is currently extremely busy and we\'ve closed our live chat for now. If you need any help, please send us an email and we will get back to you as soon as possible. Thank you for your understanding and patience!"\n\nThis stinks. It shows a general deterioration in their service.\n\nEdit: I have now received an email which says, "We aim to respond in 2 days, but it may take longer than usual." So website says one day, email says two or more days. They are clueless!\n\nFinally, unfortunately, the USA still relies on cheques. Wise has no facility to accept cheques.\n\nIn summary, they are now unreliable and have no customer service. To top it off, their fees keep going up.
