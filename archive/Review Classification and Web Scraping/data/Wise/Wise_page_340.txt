Now they changed from good to awful. I have recently experienced fraud in my Wise digital card — finding small purchases in a strange currency, and having my money eaten by some hacking/online games. I disputed the purchases, sent Wise the data and an email telling them what happened and that it was a fraud, that I did not do any purchase — since they do not have a customer support line in my country — and I received the most useless answer after almost a week. First, they did not trust my word. Second, no money will be refunded, and they’re asking me to do their job, basically. They also argued that it wasn’t fraud because I have used Paypal in the past (?????). I’m lucky it was little money I lost, but in case it was a huge amount and they’d not refund/protect their customers better, or find proper solutions to loss and fraud, I’d be furious. A bank that won’t protect their customers cannot be trusted. I do not recommend Wise. They have become invisible, untouchable, and their customer support is far from helpful. I am closing my account and will use better online banking services.', 'review_date': '2023-05-09', 'review_time': '11:48:06', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

After completing the account verification process and receiving my card, I was immediately asked to provide proof of income. When I provided my job contract, I was instantly blocked from using the service.\n\nAfter a month of trying to get answers from their support team, I finally found out that I had been blocked for no reason other than "because we can." I was then asked to provide an IBAN to return my money, but even after providing one, they were unable to return my money and asked for another IBAN.\n\nThe final straw was when I asked how I could unblock my account and was told that they do not discuss such matters with people who are not their clients. This was extremely frustrating and made me feel like I was being treated unfairly.\n\nOverall, my experience with Wise Bank was terrible. My account is still blocked, and I have not received my money back despite waiting for two months.
