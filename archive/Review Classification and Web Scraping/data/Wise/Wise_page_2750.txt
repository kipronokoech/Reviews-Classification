You simply cannot just carry their card alone. You need a backup card or you can simply use the other card and forget about them\n2-All ATM cash withdrawals are with a fee as they have no ATM machine. All others offer the chance to get cash without a fee.\n3- They are the ONLY bank I ever came across that make you pay a PENALTY for having too much money.\nMy conclusion: Use them to transfer money but they are not ready to act like a bank yet.', 'review_date': '2021-09-30', 'review_time': '11:25:26', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nOct 11, 2021\nHello Fred,\n\nThanks for sharing your experience with us.\n\nWe're not a bank, and we don't claim to be one. We hold a license as a regulated financial institution.\n\nYour card should be accepted just fine, if it's happening otherwise, it is very important that you let us know. This is the only way we can work on any improvements from our side. If you haven't yet, make sure to share more details at https://wi.se/contactus_.\n\nWhen withdrawing money, you get 2 free withdrawals up to 200 GBP total (or whatever currency is equivalent) per month. But ATM terminal can charge their own fees as well. To avoid that, we recommend that you always choose an ATM terminal owned by a bank - instead of an exchange agency.\n\nThe fees for holding money on your balances, it's not a penalty. But as it also costs us more to keep your balances, we needed to introduce this fee for certain balances.\n\nWise.", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2021-10-11', 'CompanyReplyTime': '13:01:02'}

The beauty of this is that you can always pay in local currency (no exchange rates or fees to pay..)
