We need to know who is sending money with us. As soon as verification is completed, you'll be able to send money with us.\n\nWe couldn't accept your documents because they are not matching the name you have on your Wise account, and it needs to be an exact match.\n\nPlease re-check the documents and upload the correct ones.\n\nWise Team.", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2021-08-20', 'CompanyReplyTime': '09:31:53'}

I have been waiting from last 6 months for my balances.. and havent received it..\n\nI have not passed through any kind of violations. I am simply an businessmen & they deactivated my account.\n\nI accept the deactivation of my account, but whats the point in holding the funds. Even paypal deactivates your account, but they do refund the balance after 6 months without any follow ups.\n\nWise team are biggest frauds. There customer care people do not answer anything and just give the reasons that we do not have reason for the deactivation.\n\nInitially they will smartly allow your transfers in seconds, but slowly & gradually when your volume will reach over $15-20k they will start playing their games.\n\nLets make an forum and stop this business...\n\nPlease follow below link & you will get to know how many people have got affected. Here in trust pilot they have their own fake ids where they put their good feedbacks.\n\nDo not keep balance in your account. They can deactivate with any anonymous reason. None of the financial authorities have the right to keep your money.\n\nwwwdotoffshorecorptalkdotcom/threads/transferwise-disabled-account-not-releasing-funds.29426/\n\n\nPlease support this..
