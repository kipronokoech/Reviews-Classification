The service itself has potential to be great, with my personal account Wise works very well.\n\nHowever for our business account it is a never ending problem. Accounts being blocked which hampers our ability to make work transactions is a real problem. We have been trying for weeks to solve this issue with Wise and throughout the process their customer service team has been truly unhelpful. Don’t get me wrong, they are all individually friendly and professional people, but there has been no solution. It seems like the communication within the department is truly bad, which results in us having now called multiple times, emailed multiple times - each time with promises that the issue will be resolved but with no result. This has meant that we are unable to use our business account which is causing us problems with OUR business.\n\nFor this reason I am seriously considering moving my business to a competitor such as Revolut.
