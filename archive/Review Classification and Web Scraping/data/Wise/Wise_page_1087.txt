However, we'll always try to send the money as quickly as possible. We're transparent with our fees and we'll show you the fees upfront when you set up your transfer. It can be more expensive if you send via SWIFT: https://wi.se/swiftpayments_\n\nOur Wise card isn't available in Jordan for now. We're working to launch our cards in as many countries as possible. Please register your interest at https://wi.se/cardwishlist_ and stay tuned.\n\n- Wise", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2022-09-14', 'CompanyReplyTime': '09:12:11'}
