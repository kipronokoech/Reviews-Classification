It perfectly fits with my current needs and requirements for the type of job that I work for now.\nI issue transfers on a monthly basis and also I work with at least 3 different currencies. It's super convenient for me to have the option of different balances as well as having good conversion rates that reflect their current market value. No to mention the really affordable rates for transfers. My transfers aren't for 4 digit sums, but it's good to have the rates that I have.\nFYI: I've tried a couple of other digital wallets and digital banks before. It never really worked out as I envisioned with them. There was always something that didn't feel right with them. Rates, prices, cross-device usage, design and others.
