In most regions, we offer standard delivery, so we can't provide a tracking number. However, you can find an estimated delivery time under the Cards tab in your Wise account. If you haven't received your card yet, please check this link: https://wi.se/mywisecardhasntarrived_\n\nRegarding your question about which country was your card sent from, it depends on your Wise account's address. For instance, if you're registered in the UK but order a card to be delivered in Singapore, the card will be made in the UK and then shipped internationally.\n\nWe're sorry to hear you had a bad experience with our support team.
