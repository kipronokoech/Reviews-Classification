I had to ring up to check information about a specific transfer and their employee gave me wrong information.

I complained and had a pointless conversation with their customer service representative a few weeks after the event. They only offered me a small fee waiver on a future transaction as compensation. This is really poor service and worrying that their employees ‘don’t understand all the details about complex financial transactions’ coming from a financial service provider.
