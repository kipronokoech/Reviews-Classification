I like the transparency of the whole process and the fact I am in control. Having been told in the past by others that you never get the rate quoted on the currency market with Wise you do. Their charges for the transaction are made clear up front. Once you push the button and have paid for the transaction the funds are (more or less) immediately on the receiving account, in my case my french bank account. Transactions can be completed on line 24/7 and I like the fact they guarantee to hold the rate for usually a minimum of 2 hours.
