My recent interactions with their customer service, or more accurately, the glaring absence of it, have entirely dismantled any positive opinions I held.\n\nMy attempts to contact them via email were met with nothing but silence. Furthermore, they inexplicably suspended my transactions for weeks!!! (not days), leaving me feeling anxious and powerless. I was unable to access my own funds and didn't receive any explanation or communication from them regarding the situation.\n\nAdding to my frustration was the fact that my emails to their customer support merely bounced from one support specialist to another. I was forced to explain my predicament anew each time, with no one appearing to have any previous records or understanding of my ongoing issue. I found myself trapped in a maddening cycle, constantly reiterating my problem without seeing any concrete resolution.\n\nThe lack of continuity and follow-through was shocking. When I did eventually receive a response, it was always from a different person who seemed to be completely in the dark about my situation. There was no sense of ownership or accountability, just an endless cycle of repetition and no meaningful progress.\n\nThis isn't just about a company failing to respond, it's about a company disappearing when they've put a hold on your money, leaving you stranded. The combination of being ignored, shuffled around, and left without solutions or answers is a prime example of poor customer service.\n\nI'm more than just disappointed; I'm deeply troubled. When a company with such potential and widespread reach fails to provide even the most basic level of customer support, it's more than a letdown. Wise, you've lost a customer, and rest assured, I'll be broadcasting my experiences with your subpar service and your total disregard for my situation.", 'review_date': '2023-05-16', 'review_time': '08:00:17', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nMay 30, 2023\nHi there,\n\nWe appreciate you taking the time to share your feedback with us.
