Still unresolved using the credit as it fails to transfer from the app which is up to date. Also the once competitive service is now far less so with the hefty transfer fee, will look elsewhere for future transfers\n\n[update in response to wise comments]\nFirstly my first contact was by phone as was the second when they failed to respond as promised I messaged them, sometimes these took days to answer, the transfer sat in limbo for almost a week and was only completed when I reduced the amount by the credit balance, the credit I mention sits in a wise account and despite multiple attempts could not be transferred out, wise first promised they would attempt to fix this internally then advised I needed to transfer manually which wasn't possible, as it failed no matter what I tried. No card was used & therefore not declined for the transfer so this is not applicable.\nFinally my comment on fees is in regard to how over time these crept in (I was an early adopter of this service) and then increased making the service less competitive", 'review_date': '2022-10-26', 'review_time': '03:35:56', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nOct 25, 2022\nHello,\n\nThanks for reaching out to us, Keith.
