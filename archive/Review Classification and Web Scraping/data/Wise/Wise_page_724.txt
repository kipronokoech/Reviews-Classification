Everything was working great, in terms of sending and receiving payments.\n\nThen just recently, they contacted me to request further information about a transfer. I provided that information immediately, and now, 2 weeks later, the money has not reached my team member, and they are not dealing with the issue of missing money, which they claim reached the recipient (who provided evidence that it didn't).\n\nI called them this morning, only to speak to some robot (she called herself 'A' and then after a while, gave me her name, which was probably fake), who said that the payments team will investigate. Well, what have you been doing for the last 2 weeks?\n\nEventually, after over 1 hour on the phone, she lied about not being able to hear me and disconnected the call because I continually requested to speak with a manager, and she continually told me that she is the highest-ranking person, but her job title was customer service representative, so it's again a lie.\n\nHaving read other reviews here about money going missing, I am now inclined to use a completely different provider.\n\nI will also be taking this up with the financial ombudsman in the UK. Although it's fortunately not a big sum of money (like other reviews I've read here), I will ensure it costs them more to investigate and retrieve this money.\n\nIf I had been asked my feedback before 11 months, I would have mistakenly provided a 5 star. But until it happens to you, you are in some false sense of security, because in reality, it could happen to anyone with an account in any part of the world, for any reason. Unlucky, or, some illegal practices within the company. Who knows.\n\nBut be warned, this company is amazing at not dealing with important issues (like money going missing), hiring passive aggressive robots for their customer service, and ignoring emails and official complaints.\n\nThink twice. Research all options. Don't go with Wise.", 'review_date': '2022-11-23', 'review_time': '13:54:07', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
