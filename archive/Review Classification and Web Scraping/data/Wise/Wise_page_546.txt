After more than i year transacting with wise, they decided to ask for some information from me to verify my account, which i provided.

This went on and on repeatedly until Today, dec 23, two days before the deadline, wise closed my account leaving me moneyless for christmas in a foreign country. Unfortunately, there was no clear reasoning for this, and have seen on my research a lot of people who have experienced the same, leaving them with money lost. I actually liked wise, the service and card was convenient for me. But this terrible experience left me with a feeling of distrust. Even if they reconsider my appeal and reopened my account, i will not be using them anymore.\n\nAnd for those reasons, wise will not be a service i recommend, but rather will tell people about how negative my experience is with this company.', 'review_date': '2022-12-23', 'review_time': '12:17:56', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
