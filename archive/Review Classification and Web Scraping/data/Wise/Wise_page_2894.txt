I was updated all along transfer proceedings by email so I knew exactly what was transfer status at a given time. That is excellent.\nVery good exchange rate when sending in another currency. The difference between rates used by banks, Western Union, Moneygram, etc is noticeable (up to now I found only Revolut to have slightly better rates).\nAnd, last, commission on transfer billed by Wise is cheaper than the one which is billed to me by my traditionnal french bank. The difference in cost is not huge, but transfer effected from my bank can take up to 48 hours to reach its recipient.\nTo conclude : in its range of services (money transfer to a bank account) Wise actually is one of the best that I encountered. Offering additionnal services with the same level of excellence would certainly be appreciated by all users of internet banking.', 'review_date': '2021-08-21', 'review_time': '10:01:51', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
