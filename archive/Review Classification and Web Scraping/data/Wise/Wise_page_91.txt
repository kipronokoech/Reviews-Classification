We understand how this could be frustrating, but we only ever close accounts that are being used in a way that goes against our Terms of Use: https://wi.se/customeragreement\n\nIf you think we’ve made a mistake, you can follow these guidelines to appeal our decision: https://wi.se/accountdeactivation. We’ll review your request and get back to you ASAP via email. If you already appealed and our team has sent you a response, their decision is final, and customer support can't change it.\n\nAbout the refund, we'll work on sending the remaining money in your account back to you. But first, we need to carry out due diligence checks. While we do that, your money and information stays safe and secure.\n\nSince you mention this happened 8 months ago, we'd like to take a second look at your case.
