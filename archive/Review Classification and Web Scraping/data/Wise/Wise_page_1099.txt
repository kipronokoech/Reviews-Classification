It\'s a great bank until your account is deactivated without prior notice or closure reason. They only send a generic mail from a no-reply email.\n\nAlso, attempting to contact their compliance department is not possible; the only department you can contact in wise is their support, and all they say is, "this is the decision by our team". Well, I need to speak to this team? Nope, not possible.\n\nThey suspected that I was using my account for crypto trading, which is not true at all. Any decent bank will conduct an investigation and ask the customer to provide further information about any transfer they suspect, but that seems not to be the case with wise, it\'s a one-sided investigation by their ret@rded compliance employee, so it could be your brother sending you money, but the compliance employee decided it\'s for crypto purchase, he closes your account without any investigation or an official way of appealing.\n\nAre you pissed off by our decision? Contact the Financial Ombudsman Service! That\'s the only way they mention on how to appeal their decisions.\n\nBottom line: I\'ve been a wise client for over two users, and it sucks to see things turn this way, but now I can see the clear picture; Wise is an authoritarian bank, a financial authority that gives unrestricted access to their compliance department to close accounts without any investigation or a way to appeal decisions.', 'review_date': '2022-09-10', 'review_time': '18:26:47', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nSep 12, 2022\nHello, Mostafa\n\nSorry to hear your account was deactivated. This isn't something we take lightly and it's never done without a reason. It's normally a result of a conflict with our Terms of Service or Customer Agreement, or due to a discrepancy with a financial law. We can't share the exact reason of the deactivation, due to how we're regulated. However, you can find some possible reasons here wi.se/accountdeactivation.\n\nIf you're not happy with this decision, you can appeal here https://wi.se/-appeal, and our appeals team will reach out to you once they have further updates regarding your account. Please keep in mind that this process might take up to 20 working days.\n\nWise", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2022-09-12', 'CompanyReplyTime': '11:52:33'}
