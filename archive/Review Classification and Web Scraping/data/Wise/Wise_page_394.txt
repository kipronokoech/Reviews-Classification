They gave me a number to call and said whoever answers the phone will know all about my complaint, but the person who answered didn't have a clue despite going away and asking other people. Wise said they would call me but would ask me security questions and then I would be logged out of all my devices and would have to reset my password, to which I obvioulsy said no as the FSA say we should never do that and most banks say they will never do it anyway, also I have been trying to reset my password and that doesn't work which is part of my complaint.\n\nWise are now saying they will give me an answer by 8th May which is 1 day short of 4 weeks since the problem started. I have managed to reconnect my old phone and access Wise using the fingerprint on that and I have moved virtually all my funds from the account as they have really worried me with their continual fobbing off. I have also made the FCA aware that Wise are fobbing me off and not resolving the problem etc.\n\nUPDATE 12th May\n\nWise issued a final response which just says that they haven't been able to resolve the problem and it has now been over 4 weeks, they don't answer the points that I have raised and have offered ¬£250 compensation for all the time I have had to waste. I have emailed them back raising several points and pointing out that they still haven't sorted out the problem, but they just keep replying that I have to send from the correct email address which I am doing and can prove as I have copies of all the emails I have sent.\n\nI have come to the conclusion that I have to go to the Ombudsman which I am now doing, but reserving the right to go to the County Court if I don't get a sensible amount for the ever growing time that I am having to waste on sorting out the problem with Wise.", 'review_date': '2023-05-12', 'review_time': '13:52:39', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
