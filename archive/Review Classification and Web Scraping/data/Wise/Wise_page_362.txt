Being a startup then, we couldn't afford sky-high conversion rates when transferring money to our contractors abroad, Wise seriously become a great help. The functionality to open a bank account abroad without traveling there just to open a bank account is very very good. We're now thinking to expand in 2 more countries, and Wise will be our partner, no doubt.\nGood Service, Good Features.", 'review_date': '2023-05-01', 'review_time': '12:02:13', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

I tried another transfer to my daughter, same thing happened and no money was taken from my bank. I cancelled all transfers. The next morning I found that the 276.06 had been taken and more pending amounts on my bank account. I managed to cancel the Pennington and have been unsuccessfully trying to get Wise to refund my money. I have sent screenshots of the amount taken and my bank statement etc and explained several times that they had no right to take it after the transaction had been cancelled. Despite this they tell me they have not received the money when the bank statement quite clearly shows otherwise. Due to an obvious glitch in their system when I first set up the transfers and another glitch now it seems they have managed to lose 276.07 GBP of my money and are doing nothing to resolve this.', 'review_date': '2023-05-01', 'review_time': '12:01:44', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

I rarely encounter issues but since they rebranded to "WISE", problems occur now here and there. They have terrible customer support (a person named Adi) that does not give you resolution and unacceptable replies and only keeps saying "we will ask the relevant team" and never gets back to you. This agent is very rude.\n\nThey settle money so late from their end despite the bank being the same for the last 5 years and cut the guarantee rate time then overcharges you extra in exchange rate. This is ridiculous! You can\'t find anyone to escalate or speak to. Conversations with their support just keep going back in circles as if they don\'t read or follow the whole discussion.

I was selling a device on FB marketplace and there was this potential buyer who seemed very interested. He told me he would like to make a payment upfront using Wise. He sent me the money but Wise couldn’t credit the money onto my account and they requested the buyer to pay an additional payment of a couple of hundred bucks. Allegedly he did pay the extra money, then I got an email from Wise that he sent the money but they still can’t credit the money until I send a few hundred dollars to the buyer. Apparently this is some kinda policy at Wise, they try to protect their customers, that’s what they told me anyway. I told them I don’t have that kind of money to send to the buyer and even if I had I wouldn’t because that’s just ridiculous. Then they made me to send a minimum amount of money to the buyer so they can credit the money to my account. I sent the buyer 10 bucks then about an hour later Wise came back to me saying they are terrible sorry but they couldn’t credit the money but I shouldn’t worry, they will send me a digital check. They asked me for my bank details and stuff like that, they even asked for my password to my online banking. That just did it for me! I was so pissed off with the whole process, it was beyond ridiculous. If that’s the kinda s*** Wise transfer does then I can’t say a nice word about them. Eventually they asked me to send the device to the buyer first then send a photo of the receipt I was given at the post office and then they will credit me the whole amount the buyer “sent” me. Yeah right! That was the biggest scam anyone ever tried to pull on me. If that was the real Wise bank then all I can say is shame on y’all calling yourselves professionals..', 'review_date': '2023-05-01', 'review_time': '09:22:45', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
