I am late on my taxes, rent, and car payments because of Wise. Have had a lot of sleepless nights in the last 10 days.\n\nThey apologized and just said it was a human error and that I should have been authorized immediately.\n\nThe trust in Wise is completely lost at this point. Such an unprofessional client service, and a complete lack of caring for the user. I was treated like a criminal because of a human error.\n\nI strongly advise everyone to reconsider using Wise.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nI am a freelancer designer and registered business in my Country. I keep accounting and pay all the taxes regularly. I have been using Wise for almost 5 years now as my business account.\n\nFirst issue:\nTheir services were great until October 13 when they sent me an email that they were changing my USD account details effective immediately. I had one incoming payment sent to that account a few hours before the email and that payment did not go through and funds were sent back to my client 5 days later.\nIf I had received this email just a day earlier I could have stopped that payment from going to the wrong account details. As I can see other business got their notices two weeks earlier than me.\n\nIssue 2:\nThe same day (October 13) I received the mentioned email, I made a withdrawal from that same USD account to my local bank account.\nUsually, I do not check on my withdrawals but two days later I went into my account and saw that my withdrawal was paused. When I opened the details it said they needed documents for additional verification. I have sent immediately my annual statements from the last 12 months and it's been 8 days since then and my withdrawal is still on hold.\nTwo additional payments for rent and a car lease were also put on hold so I am overdue with those payments as well.\n\nI have contacted them by email and they said they will need up to 10 business days to check my documents but as I can see here on Trustpilot a lot of people have the same problem and the wait period is much longer.\nI got them on the phone, 25 minutes waiting on the line and another 17 minutes talking to an agent who can not help me. Just repeating that I need to be patient and wait 10 working days until they contact me or authorize withdrawal. So it could take a lot more time if they decide they need more documents from me.\n\nBTW. My Wise Visa card is still functional for all payments but I can't make direct payments to my suppliers or make payments to other accounts.\n\nTerrible experience and trust was broken. This should have been fixed in a matter of hours. How do they think businesses can work normally in these conditions? Can't make payments and I am scared of receiving new payments until this is resolved.\nI need these frozen funds to pay all my taxes and invoices for September.\n\nA shame this happened. I have recommended their services to dozens of people and businesses before this incident.", 'review_date': '2023-11-01', 'review_time': '14:58:42', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
