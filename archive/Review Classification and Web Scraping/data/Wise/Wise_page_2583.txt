When I at last found the correct "path", everything went so fast, it took only seconds to transfer from my British account to my Fench account. Amazing! I DO MIND VERY MUCH, however, and Wise is not the only website concerned, that their lettering is in the "à la mode" grey or pale blue tones, which makes reading the text unpleasant to difficult. If a website has something to convey in text, it should do so in good old fashioned black & white, in order to be clearly, easily read.
