This app is perfect for people who have friends, family, or business partners living abroad, as it offers a simple and cost-effective solution for sending money across borders.\n\nWhat makes Wise stand out from other money transfer services is its transparency and low fees. With Wise, you'll always know exactly how much you're paying for your transfer, and you can rest assured that you're getting the best possible exchange rate. Additionally, Wise's fees are significantly lower than those charged by traditional banks, making it a great choice for anyone looking to save money.\n\nBut Wise isn't just about saving you money; it's also about making the process of sending and receiving money as simple and straightforward as possible. The app is incredibly user-friendly, with a clean and intuitive interface that makes it easy to navigate. You can send and receive money in just a few clicks, and the entire process is completed within minutes.\n\nAnother great feature of Wise is its multi-currency account. This allows you to hold and manage multiple currencies in a single account, which is incredibly convenient if you frequently send money to different countries.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend the Wise app to anyone who needs to send or receive money internationally. It's a game-changer that has disrupted the traditional banking industry, and it's definitely worth giving it a try.", 'review_date': '2023-02-23', 'review_time': '02:55:58', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

I kept getting told that there were verification checks that needed to be done first, which is absolutely fine, and then all future payments would be processed immediately. I managed to send some money but the next payment failed, pending further checks. This was repeated over and over again. I kept getting told it was due to regulatory checks, which again is fine, but every time ? There was even one payment that I sent to myself (another bank account) which took over 24 hours to process. After many emails backwards and forwards they eventually closed my account and then all email communication stopped. My account had Â£550 in it and eventually I managed to get a link so I could appeal. This could take up to 20 working days which is absolutely terrible. I then decided to check here and I wished I\'d done it before I opened the account as some of the reviews I\'m reading are terrible. I notice that they only reply to some of the comments and then it seems to be a fairly generic "we always want to offer our customers a positive experience", "rest assured this hasn\'t been done without good reason", "we hear your concern and rest assured your money is safe". Well after reading these reviews I wont be resting assured ! If necessary, I will keep fighting to get my money back and escalate this to the financial services ombudsman. Only gave 1 start review as couldn\'t give 0. Would certainly not recommend this bank.\n\n\n08/03/2023.\nFinally, a response that\'s taken over 2 weeks, continuing with the terrible customer service from Wise bank. In response to your reply to my original post, you have indeed sent a reply containing many generic comments, as expected.\n\nYou refer to conducting due diligence which I absolutely agree you should do. However, on previous occasions when you have been \'reviewing\' money/payments that Wise receive it has taken 24 hours but as soon as it comes to you returning money all of a sudden it\'s 2 weeks and still you haven\'t returned it. What checks are you making exactly and why is it taking so long this time ?\n\nIn addition, I have had to resort to bombarding you with follow up emails because you haven\'t the decency or professionalism to reply. It\'s taken me to spam you with lots of emails yesterday before you finally reply, albeit not giving me any real information about what you are doing. I will continue to do this until you reply with a useful response.\n\nJust to remind you, you are still hanging on to my money from 20/02/2023. If you think I\'m going to forget about this then think again. The clock is ticking but I will be raising this with the Financial Services Ombudsman as soon as I can unless you return my money that you are hanging on to and refuse to return.\n\nOutstanding questions:\n1. What due diligence checks are you making ?\n2. Why have the checks taken over 2 weeks already yet previous checks took about 24 hours ?\n3. When are you going to refund my money to me ?', 'review_date': '2023-03-08', 'review_time': '08:45:48', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nMar 8, 2023\nHey, Pete\n\nThank you for the through review, and we're sorry to hear about your account.\n\nAs a financial institution we deal with people's money every single day, and therefore we need to make sure we're able to keep it safe. Not only your money, but also our platform. To keep our promise that we keep our customers' money safe, we need to carry out routine checks from time to time.\nWe don't understand that speed is very important when it comes to transfer, and it's always our priority. However, so is diligence.\n\nWe give everything from our side to make these checks as quick and painless as possible, but it can take up to several days in rare cases.\n\nWhen it comes to deactivation this indeed never done without a reason. We follow a strict set of rules set by regulatory agencies in every country we operate in â€” like the FCA in the UK. These agencies protect you, and protect the market we operate in.\n\nWe completely understand that this can be an inconvenient situation, and we'll always do everything in our power to make the appeals process smooth and fast.\n\nThat being said if you already appeal, then our team will get back to you via email ASAP.\n\nAs for your remaining money in your account, we'll work on sending it back to you. But first, we need to carry out due diligence checks. While we do that, your money and information will be safe and secure.\n\nDue diligence checks are conducted to verify the information you have provided to us. We are required to do these at all stages of the customer relationship, not just during the initial onboarding stage, so this means during the customer relationship as well as during the deactivation stage.\n\nWise", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2023-03-08', 'CompanyReplyTime': '08:27:05'}
