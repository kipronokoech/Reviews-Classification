They made me add 20 EUR into my account, I ordered a card for some of them. Transferred 400+ EUR to my personal account. After a while, I decided to try to apply for a business account, they asked for 20 EUR again from me to fill out a SIMPLE APPLICATION (which does not guarantee approval, I have never seen anything like this). When I paid, a few minutes later I received a message saying that my personal account was closed (which had 400+ EUR of my personal money!). They send a link to the contact page, which I cannot use without my account. That is, I can no longer contact the support team, there are no chats for people with no existing account. In the last message about the closure of the account, they promised to return the money (however, it is not clear where, if my account no longer exists and they did not ask where to send the remaining balance).

Perhaps you mean fast transfer? Do keep in mind this speaks as to how fast your money will reach us. That'because the faster it reach us, the faster we can process it and send it to your recipient.\n\nAnother thing to note is that once the transfer is completed by us, it means it was sent out to your recipient and it's up to their bank to process the payment into their account. Some banks are faster than other, but this isn't a process we can speed up from our side.\n\nAll the best,\nWise Team.", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2021-04-28', 'CompanyReplyTime': '17:42:51'}
