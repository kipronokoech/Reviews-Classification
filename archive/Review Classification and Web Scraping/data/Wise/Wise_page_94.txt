It's been awesome helping so many of the customers quit/stya off the smokes. I've loved every moment of the journey and lived it with you. It started off as a dream, other people laughed when I only had 3 products on my website. Now it's a fully fledged store and nobody is laughing now!\n\nThe customers have turned my dream into a reality. I was studying to get into medical school, but my plan B of falling back on my (at the time) little store keeping my finances just afloat enough to live off.... it all changed when I decided to get serious about the store and double the profits in 3 months making it a viable career or job.\n\nI soon had to make the tough decision between medical school or TheCoilMan because I was not having enough time during the day for both. I was attending workshops, coming home collecting deliveries, post-office by 4:30PM, studying.... it was all too much!!\n\nI knew my peers at University had it all, they still lived with their parents, had their meals cooked, clothes cleaned etc. I was living alone in an apartment I could abrely afford to keep afloat.\n\nI made the leap and jumped full on into TheCoilMan and never looked back! While the future of vaping is un-certain, I will always find a way to run TheCoilMan, however way is possible. I am sure despite any legislations or laws, I will still run this shop for a long amount of time to come! Nothing can stop TheCoilMan!\n\nWe've recently got our Trademark (IP) from the Australian Government but also had our troubles with the ATO, a recent audit has gone to independent review with mixed opinions on GST tax law. Despite these ups and downs, I've managed to stay on top of things and do my due dilligance, to ensure orders get out on time and customers are always looked after.\n\nIt's been my pleasure serving each and every one of you and I would like to extend my thanks to anyone who has ever bought or messaged me over the past 7 years. You are all the greatest to me and I have full empathy for what you have acheived for me!\n\nThank you and never forget....
