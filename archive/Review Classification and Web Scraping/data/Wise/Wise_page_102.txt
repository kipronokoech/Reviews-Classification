Never had a problem, but suddenly a very simple transaction - buying a sewing machine - has turned into this fraught situation with Wise holding onto my money, because apparently they didn't like the payment reference.\n\nI might add, the reference contained the machine model and my name so that the seller knew who the money was from, and for what. These kind of references are purely additional info between buyer and seller and having nothing to do with Wise whatsoever.\n\nWise are now clearly running AI with a flawed algorithm to try and automatically detect issues, and why this AI is even trying to make something out of a reference or is even allowed to read what is an optional field is beyond me.\n\nOf course, the whole of Wise appears to be AI managed, so you will only get robotic answers when you try to resolve the issue. They send an email from 'support at wise.com' and ask that you reply 'above this line'. You do that, and the email gets bounced saying that their support email is not manned! What? What the heck? You are basically just left in limbo.\n\nAs I said, a stupidly simply transaction has turned into a nightmare.
