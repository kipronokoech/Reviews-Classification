We aim to complete all transfers are fast as possible, but delays can happen for different reasons. It could be because the transfer was set up closer to the weekend/holidays, or because we needed to carry extra checks. You can read about it here: https://wi.se/howlongdoesatransfertakes\n\nWe can see that our support team has explained the situation to you via email and the funds are now on your account.\n\nWe truly appreciate your patience.\n\nWise', 'CompanyReplyDate': '2022-09-13', 'CompanyReplyTime': '10:54:27'}
