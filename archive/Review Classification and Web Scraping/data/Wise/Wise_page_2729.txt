These checks can take approximately 60 working days (you can’t count weekends or holidays), and you’ll be reached as soon as everything is done from our side.\n\nIf it has been longer than 60 working days, please reach us at https://wi.se/contactus_. Make sure to choose one of the options below “what’s your question about”, and you’ll see our numbers and contact form there.
