So far, so good. However, what Wise does is try and circumvent paying credit card merchant fees by categorizing every transaction as a "top-up" - so instead of paying the fee directly, they first add the funds to your account and then pay the fee from that. But they don\'t tell you this is what they are doing - to the customer, it looks like just another normal credit card charge. Until your credit card company charges you a cash advance fee for the "top up" that is!!\n\nAnd of course Wise accepts no responsibility for this. The four emails I wrote back and forth with the rep were also simply canned responses, I\'m still not sure whether I was actually corresponding with a real human or whether they just have a chatbot in the background that sends out emails based on keyword matches.\n\nNeedless to say, this has completely soured me on Wise and despite paying 42 euros for two business bank accounts, I\'m going to start looking for other options.', 'review_date': '2022-11-01', 'review_time': '15:05:17', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
