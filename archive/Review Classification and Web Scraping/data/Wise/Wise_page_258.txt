I can't recommend them anymore. I cancelled our most recent transfer because they didn't send the two small amounts to verify our bank account YET AGAIN (that I've used before on Wise) and I lost the favourable exchange rate. Had I transferred with our bank (HSBC) to begin with I would have been better off in the long run. There is zero customer service from Wise. It doesn't matter how much money one has sent over the years or how often one uses Wise, there is no customer loyalty. My husband was going to make the transfer using his Wise account (which is the one we normally use) and they asked to verify his identity (YET AGAIN) for the same transfer (same bank acct to same bank acct) that we've been doing since 2017; 33 transfers of CONSIDERABLE amounts! He is out of town and we use my phone for the account so he couldn't take a selfie. If unusual activity was being requested we would be grateful for this hassle, but what Wise is doing now is harassing us. We lost money with the exchange rate because of their time wasting which I actually wondered if it was strategic. They only guarantee the rate for a certain number of hours. We still can't use our accounts. So, what's the point? There is xe.com and even our bank, HSBC, has quite favourable foreign exchange rates. And noticing all the negative reviews in recent months, with similar hassles, plus if you check out consumer affairs website it appears as if Wise has serious internal problems. I will definitely not be transferring money with them again.", 'review_date': '2023-06-08', 'review_time': '19:40:14', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
