They seem to be going downhill and are selectively scamming their customers by either making payments disappear and from what I read on here ask for verification upon verification just to keep your money.\n\nI am warning you - they will take your money and not reply your emails NOR give access to your money.\n\nWhen I tried to contact them all they say is "We cannot give any more information. Contact the sender of the Wise payment".\n\nWHAT? YOU ARE THE SENDER!!! The "sender" they refer to can only see that the money have indeed been "Sent". But no money been received. Quite simple to solve. You are the only one who can track the money and see actual real status about the sent money. Stop acting like a fool, playing stupid, just solve it!\n\nI request EVERYONE IN HERE to report their fraudulent activities in Belgium (WISE EUROPE S.A - BELGIUM) and in the United Kingdom.\n\nSTAY AWAY FROM WISE!
