We’re a regulated financial institution and as such, we need to carry extra checks on transfers from time to time. This is a routine procedure to help us ensure we’re keeping our platform safe for everyone using (including you) while complying with local regulations.\n\nDo keep in mind, we always make sure to update you along the way, and you’ll know the status of your transfer at all times.\n\nWise', 'CompanyReplyDate': '2022-07-07', 'CompanyReplyTime': '08:04:00'}
