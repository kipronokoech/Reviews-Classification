You'll always see upfront how much you're sending and how much the recipient will get, as well as all the fees. The only exception is if you made the transfer via SWIFT, in which case the intermediary banks can charge their own commissions. Such fees have nothing to do with Wise.\n\nSince you made the transfer from your local bank, if the currency you hold in your bank is not USD, then it's likely a SWIFT case: https://wi.se/swiftpayments_ which would mean we only received the amount our team shared with you in the receipt. The 25 USD could be a commission from intermediary banks.\n\nIf you have other questions, please reach out to us here: https://wi.se/contactus_ or on Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram with your email and user number.

It helps us combat money laundering, and keep everyone’s money safe. That way we can keep providing you even faster, cheaper and more transparent service.\n\nThat's not all – we also have different regulatory requirements in different regions. Because of this, we might need to ask more, or different, questions/docs, depending on where you move money to or from, or where you live. This means we might need to verify your account more than once.\n\nWe're all for speed, but safety is something that we're always extra careful with.

They have honest reviews thanks to their good service . But they have some communication and operation limits I hope they can fix. Unfortunately they take control of your accounts without advance notice, creating both liquidity and social security problems. My personal account deactivated without notice today, is deactivated for not complying with section 1.2.2 of the Acceptable Use Policy. My use has always been one, to send money to my multiples personal bank accounts, as a digital nomad I have more than one in more than one country and personal expenses in these countries , always under my name. By personal accounts we mean accounts under my name and surname. I have never paid in my entire history of personal transactions to third party accounts even once . Previously they blocked my business account for the same policy but at least they gave me 30 days to withdraw the funds. These funds were withdrawn to my personal Wise account and from this a part left in Wise because I considered the wallet safe and a part I send to my personal accounts for ordinary expenses. Now receiving an email where they say they can take till 30 days to review my account in order to refund me. Two considerations : about Wise Business , many influencers that are on Only Fans ( prohibited on Wise ) , open LLCs which then receive payments from English companies which therefore do not allow Only Fans to be associated directly with Wise, many have accounts of up to hundred of thousand of USD a year without being blocked for these activities. On the other hand, anyone who like me openly clarifies with the type of business and makes one type of transaction on the personal account of ridiculous amounts is deactivated. I understand why, for the business account, but the method used on the personal one has no reason to be accepted as personal accounts means personal expenses, and money can be done with your business account and wired on your personal for personal expenses. I will make recurring updates on the situation and the speed of the practice here on trustpilot and possibly on LinkedIn and my blogs to help you understand if it is a valid tool for remittance transactions to yourself ( this is my case ) , for the rest you always need a real bank account ( Mercury Novel, or a simply N26 account) .
