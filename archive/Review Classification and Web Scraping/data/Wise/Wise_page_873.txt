I have used wise for 3 years without any problems. but on 12 october my account was suddenly closed. This deeply shook my confidence. My trust in wise is gone. There is no reason for me to open a multi-currency account. When I first registered I was going to have a virtual bank of all currencies for 20 euros and I did. if you've already taken the review. In general, I only used euros and dollars. Customer service is responsive. however. no one knows why my account was closed or when it will be opened. appeal has been over 2 weeks yet no response I am not a company, nor am I a money launderer at all. I earn money from my game friends and game account sales. These are small amounts. I request that my account be reactivated as soon as possible. otherwise, if there is no valid reason, I will take legal action.\nwith respect and love.", 'review_date': '2022-10-24', 'review_time': '15:28:09', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nOct 25, 2022\nHello,\n\nSorry to hear your account was deactivated. This isn't something we take lightly. It's normally a result of a conflict with our Terms of Service or Customer Agreement, or due to a discrepancy with a financial law. We can't always share the exact reason for the deactivation, due to how we're regulated.\n\nHowever, you can find some possible reasons here wi.se/accountdeactivation.\n\nOn this link, you can also find which steps you can take next and refund details (in case you have remaining balances). And once you do that, our team will get back to you within 30 business days with more information. If they made a mistake, they'll re-activate the account, but until then, customer support can't speed this process up. Make sure to keep an eye on your emails, as that's where our team will reach out.\n\nWise.", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2022-10-25', 'CompanyReplyTime': '09:29:57'}
