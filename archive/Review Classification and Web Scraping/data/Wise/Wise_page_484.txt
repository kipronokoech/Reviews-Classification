This is to keep our services safe. Sometimes, we do need more information about a transfer and as a regulated financial institution, we're required to check on such things.\n\nWe'll let you know the documents we can accept, and once we have the necessary details, we'll send out the money ASAP. It seems like there might be some misunderstanding about your address and we'd like to take a closer look at your case.\n\nPlease reply to our emails with more info, or send us a private message on our social media platforms.
