Now before, the transfer was pending and I would then (separately), log into my bank and make the payment. Not any more. I was now forced to log into Lloyds via the Wise portal. Guess what? It doesn't work. The Lloyds site would freeze each time. So instead of a low cost transfer, I was forced to pay by card. This was declined (by Lloyds) since it looked like an unusual activity. On top of that, you are warned by Wise that, if you cancel a transfer, you'll pay more next time. Chat link not working, forecast waiting time for help on the phone, one hour and twenty minutes. One thing is crystal clear. Even if I can get to the payment stage, I won't deal with any company, whose idea of customer service is an hour and twenty minute telephone wait when THEIR processes don't work.", 'review_date': '2022-06-01', 'review_time': '11:50:48', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nJun 2, 2022\nHello, Chris,\n\nOur customer support is indeed under higher volumes right now.
