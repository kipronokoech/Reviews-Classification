The problem is that you just don't know which it will be. I sent money on Saturday and WISE reported that due to technical issues my money was sent and then returned. So I cancelled this transaction and began another. Same result only this time Wise reported the money would be received on Monday in the AM and then in the PM and then later in the PM.\n\nMonday, the transfer goes through. My bank shows the deduction. BUT a few hours later the money is returned. Now this is for my pregnant daughter who is due to have a baby this Wednesday so she needs to have some Euros on hand. So I try once more. Bingo -- the transfer goes through in 7 seconds. I get a text -- thank you , thank you and all is well.\n\nBut then WISE sends another chunk of money from my account 12 hours later. Fortunately I have enough to cover the withdrawal, but if I didn't, I would have ridiculous bank fees on my end for being overdrawn.\n\nMy daughter got extra money which is better than no money but I can not afford unauthorized transfer when WISE decides.\n\nBTW: with all this fooling around, the exchange rate did not move in my favor and each cancelled transaction was a loss from the original rate on Saturday.\n\nWhen WISE works, and it has in the past, it is great. However, like now when it doesn't, there is no way to actually communicate with anyone in the organization.
