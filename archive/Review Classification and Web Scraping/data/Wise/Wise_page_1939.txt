We're working towards a free to use product, but we haven't reached this goal just yet. Until then, we'll always disclose our fees before you pay for your transfer, and we keep our pricing as transparent (and low) as possible.\n\nWise Team.", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2022-05-24', 'CompanyReplyTime': '09:10:02'}
