{'platform': 'Paypal', 'id': '634daa68377e522e3151af73', 'stars': 1, 'title': 'PayPal is incompetent.', 'message': 'The new business my husband and I own recently invoiced our second client via PayPal, per the client’s request. The invoice went to the client with no issue. Unbeknownst to us, PayPal took 3.5% of the total amount. As annoying as that was, even more frustrating was the fact that we were told we couldn’t withdraw the funds for 3 weeks. It was explained to me by someone at the company that they have to make sure our business wasn’t a “risk” for PayPal until we’ve made a total of 10 transactions. I let them know we’re making our client wait to begin building their instrument bc of their “policy”. Also, 9 more transactions would take forever bc of both the slow nature of our new business (crafting high-end musical instruments) and the fact that we typically invoice through our QuickBooks account. That sealed the deal for us to no longer use PayPal once we received the money. The balance was available after about 2 weeks instead of 3, but then I was informed that a transfer might not go through because the name on the business bank account didn’t match the name of the PayPal account (I recently changed my name to my married name, and am still changing everything related, incl our business bank account). I contacted Paypal to ask if I needed to do anything to ensure the transfer would go through because of this, and was essentially told to try it and see. Lol that’s no help, I was trying to avoid having any issues but the individual could offer no help beyond, “just try and see”. The transfer did go through, thankfully, but the latest issue arose when trying to close the account. PayPal blocked the account closure and I was told today that there was a “wall” put up by the company bc they needed to verify my identity. I had verified my married name change with the appropriate documents, so why they again need me to verify my identity is a bit ridiculous. Today, I was given instructions on how to upload the documents, but they made no sense. I was told to look for the notification bell to address the issue when no notification bell existed in my web browser. I was alternatively given a link to click and upload the docs. I clicked the link but the page read, “Thanks! You’re all set. Everything checked out…” I remarked on this and asked for either a working link or an email address to send the docs to. The next cust svc associate reiterated the instructions with some ALL CAPS to look for the NOTIFICATION BELL. I again had to reiterate it didn’t exist, then sent a screen shot to prove it. If they had actually read what I wrote previously, we could’ve skipped that entirely. Only after that did I get the working link and an email address I had previously asked for. I’ve uploaded the docs and am waiting to get the all clear so that we can close our business account. I’ve had no problem with PayPal over the years until now. I have lost all confidence in this company and am, sadly, expecting more issues before being able to close the account. I don’t trust them with my info and I don’t trust their competency.', 'review_date': '2022-10-17', 'review_time': '21:18:00', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
