I opened an old account and needed to do a name change so I submitted all the documents and they changed it to the wrong name. I emailed them in frustration and told them to read the rest of my drivers license so they could actually change it to my correct name. I then got an email saying I would need to call them and make the change. So, I called them to make the change and they told me they couldn’t do it unless I submitted another request for a name change. I said, you want me to submit all of the same documents that you are looking at right now so that you can change my name to the correct name? He said yes and apologized for the inconvenience. I said no, you have all of the documents in front of you and it’s insanity for me to send it all over again and hope for something different. You have everything you need, you have all of my documents, just change it to the correct name. It’s right there on my drivers license that you have on file! He wouldn’t budge and I said that I wanted to speak with a manager. He put me on hold for an extended amount of time and then came back and hung up on me. I then called back. When you call PayPal, the automated service asks if the number you are calling from can be used to look up your account. I said OK. It then told me that I would have a two-hour wait but said I could be on a callback list if that would be better. I obviously wasn’t going to be on a callback-list nor wait two hours on hold when I had just gotten off the phone with their representative. I knew they were there. So, I called back again and said "no" when the automated answering service asked to verify my account with my phone number. At that point I was on hold for about two minutes before a representative got on the phone. Ironic that when they didn’t know it was me they were happy to answer the phone. It was the same guy. So, to sum it up, they got mad at me because I was frustrated at THEIR mistake and wanted a manager to correct it. Then they flagged my account and wouldn\'t take my call. They lied. They said it was a two hour wait when it clearly wasn\'t. When I told him I wanted to cancel he was happy to handle it. He couldn\'t change my name with my drivers license in front of him nor put me in touch with a manager, but he was happy to close the account. He didn\'t even ask why I was canceling so I let him know I\'d be contacting the BBB, Google reviews, and social media to report my experience and he happily said "ok". He didn\'t care, nobody there cared. I\'m just one person. But I\'m now one less customer and if they continue with service like that I won\'t be the last to walk away. It was by far the laziest and unprofessional customer service I\'ve ever encountered, and I\'m in the customer service industry.', 'review_date': '2018-07-16', 'review_time': '23:36:10', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

Upon calling UPS, they informed us that the UPS tracking code they gave comes back to a different name and address. I tried calling the number listed, and it is fake. The address listed on the site (3435 Main St Buffalo, NY 14214) is a university. Upon researching the company, it appears the company itself is a scam. I placed an order for a Google Home Max. Three days later, I got an email from them that my package had been delivered; it included the UPS delivery information. I did not receive the package. It turns out the tracking number was for a package delivered to a local beauty supply store. UPS was helpful in providing documentation about the tracking number, so I could show PayPal that the package really wasn\'t delivered. PayPal initially denied my claim, which I why I needed to contact UPS. PayPal currently is investigating the matter. I see online that 50flashsale.com uses this scam frequently.
