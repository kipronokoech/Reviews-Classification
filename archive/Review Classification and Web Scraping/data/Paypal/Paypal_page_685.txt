My only gripe is that on November 2nd, I received an email from Paypal stating I\'d received $5.00 USD from them as an appreciation for my business. Seeing as how I didn\'t need anything when it was given, I didn\'t use the $5 right away (but I made sure to log into my account to make sure the money was there and it was.) Since then, Paypal has been sending me an email on the 12th and the 26th reminding me that I needed to spend the $5 before November 30th. Why I\'m given a limit of time on a "gift", I still don\'t understand but whatever. It\'s November 28th and I decided to spend that $5 on a couple of games in my Steam wish list for Black Friday. When I went to check my Paypal account to make sure the money was still there, I saw 0.00 as my balance. Considering it\'s not November 30th, I was dumbfounded as to why the money was taken from my account. I guess I waited too long but I can\'t say I\'m upset about it. $5 really can\'t buy you anything online, especially with shipping & handling involved. Plus, I\'ve never had a problem with Paypal since I opened my account years ago.', 'review_date': '2019-11-28', 'review_time': '22:13:53', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

Sold a high value item on Ebay, buyer had low feedback which should have been a red flag for me. But I went through with the sale. the buyer did pay immediately. However Paypal put the fund on hold as they flag the sale as "high-risk item" this is despite the fact that I sold another item 2 days prior of same value same type without any issues.\n\nPaypal asked me to post the item to the buyer first and make sure it is trackable and the fund will be release 24 hours after the tracking showing "Delivered". at this point, I raised issue that if the buyer decides to refuse delivery and the item had to be picked up from depot or someone else signs for the item at the address what happens. Paypal reassured me that they do not verify names of the delivery but trust the delivery company to ensure the delivery is made ie "Delivered".\n\nso I went ahead and posted the item on next day delivery and the item was delivered. Royal Mail showed the item was "DELIVERED" but signed by a different person than the recipient. So I called paypal request the fund to be release as I had fulfilled my side of the transaction. Paypal refuses release fund as the agent stipulated that the buyer\'s name was not on the tracking information to which I asked the agent to revert to the conversation I had with another agent 2 days prior. the agent out right refused and stuck to her script. I hung up and did some investigation with Royal mail, it turns out the address is unique to a university and the person signed was the door man/mail room staff. I tracked down the mail room staff and had it all confirmed that item was received and the buyer collected the item from the university mail room and there was record as such. so with all the information, I called back to Paypal, guess what, they outright refuse to accept any evidence.\n\nSo in summary, if paypal ever holds any of your transaction and asks you to post item first, just cancel the sale and relist. it is not worth the grief. alternatively by-pass paypal if possible and select cash on collection only. this way as a seller you are in the clear from ebay and paypal.', 'review_date': '2019-11-28', 'review_time': '15:00:36', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
