But when you're using it with EBay's buyers protection it's when you wish there's alternative forms of payment. It happened to me twice, when you buy something expensive, and the seller sent you something else altogether (usually something much much cheaper or worthless), you're required to send the item back signed received by the seller, with the shipping paid by the victim. The problem comes when the seller refuses the package and it gets sent back after 3 attempts. Sending it again and your protection period is over. Calling the help desk repeatedly explaining my problem, I even sent documentary proof from the courier that the seller was not present to receive the package after attempts to deliver numerous times and trying to contact seller through the telephone and email address provided by PayPal, and I offered to send the package to them if they think I'm greedy wanting to keep the package and a refund, but the dispute team continued to insist that seller signature must be obtained in order for me to get a refund. Even a bad review written on these sellers by me got removed. DO NOT BUY EXPENSIVE ITEMS ON EBAY USING PAYPAL. It's a loophole that's being abused and you do need to get ready to lose your money with every transaction.

{'platform': 'Paypal', 'id': '5e0324dec845450834356cd8', 'stars': 1, 'title': 'What happened to PayPal?', 'message': 'I\'ve religiously used PayPal since I was just a high school student, around 2011. I loved it, shopping online became far more streamlined and it let me easily get some extra cash by selling through eBay. Any time I had to call or email them, they were friendly, responsive, and quickly solved my issues.\n\n....Of course, note all that is in past tense. As of late, PayPal has gone down the gutter. First off, customer service has become a joke. You can email them to get a generic response, contact them on Facebook/Twitter then wait a week for a response that might be from a real person, or call them and after dealing with bots and being on hold for an hour talk to a rep who says they can\'t help you. They suggest their forums as well, where near everyone is also struggling with PayPal but the same 2-3 top posters will say "too bad" and defend PayPal.\n\nSecond biggest issue, "buyer protection" is literally nonexistent. Hundreds of people are being ripped off by Chinese scammers lately and receiving garbage or empty packages, but just because these scammers have tracking numbers they\'re safe from reprimand, and all of the scammed customers are in the wrong. Paypal sides with the scammers then demands that you pay $35 to send a $1 item back to China so that they can give you your $40 back.\n\nI myself lost $300 to PayPal. After cancelling an order and only getting 1/3 of what I paid back, I assumed PayPal would protect me and opened a dispute but sadly I was wrong. Even after showing all conversations with the seller, all transaction IDs, the partial refund I got when I was told I\'d get a full one, and that I never even got any item, PayPal decided that the seller deserves a free $300 and denied my case. Provided even more evidence and they denied it a second time, making sure I didn\'t get that money in time for the holidays.\n\nAt this point PayPal is a scamming company themselves. If I wasn\'t an eBay seller I\'d delete my account this minute. Don\'t use PayPal thinking you\'re safe, you\'re better off with a credit card. At least those companies care about their customers and will give you your money back.\n\n1/22/20 UPDATE: Finally, 2 and a half months after probably dealing with every Paypal rep through phone, email, and chat I got my money back. This review is staying a 1 star though, as I shouldn\'t have had to go through all the hoops I did to get my money back from an obvious fraud.', 'review_date': '2020-01-23', 'review_time': '12:08:36', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
