I used PayPal on a daily basis for three years without a problem, until my account was frozen recently due to "suspicious activity". I used PayPal to receive money from a friend, which they for some reason characterize as suspicious activity. I\'ve appealed this matter several times now as instructed by themselves without luck. I\'ve spoken with them on the phone for several hours without luck. Customer service is great at the beginning, but in the end I found the service representative to be very rude and unhelpful. They have now frozen a substantial amount of money for five months - my money. It needs to be said that my account has existed for three years, it\'s "verified", I\'ve supplied them with copies of my passport, address verification, student identification card, etc. This is just completely unacceptable. I won\'t be using their service ever again, it\'s very unfortunate that Ebay pretty much require the use of PayPal.', 'review_date': '2012-10-17', 'review_time': '00:50:32', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

I recently moved and diligently went through all of my online service that I use and changed the address. SO I THOUGHT. I ordered some items using PayPal and had not received them so I decided to go to my account to get an idea on eta. Much to my surprise they were shipped to my old address and sent back to the shipper because the forwarding had expired a month ago. I called PayPal "customer service" and was told that what I seen on my screen to remove the old address does not mean that it is gone, you need to call and have the records updated with them. I explained that I had the correct information showing on my screen and was told to look at the full information. Lo and behold there was my "shipping address" at the old location.\n\nI asked how I would be reimbursed for my additional shipping to have the products returned to me and she told me that it was my responsibility to make the changes on my account. I then re-explained that I went online (after all it is an online company) changed my address and deleted the old address from the screen. She then told me that I needed to contact PayPal to finish the job.\n\nAll I know is that if you are moving call the asses and get the job done according to them the right way.\n\nPayPal is a great service SOMETIMES but remember they do not take responsibility for their F##k ups.', 'review_date': '2012-07-29', 'review_time': '16:46:48', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
