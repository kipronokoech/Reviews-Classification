She damaged my phone, sent it back to me, and then got all of HER money back! So, I took legal advice (included in my house insurance!) and put a claim in against Paypal - and I won!

I never had a problem, you buy on ebay and it does it all automatically. Recently I had a clear out and decided to sell some things. I started on ebay and had no problems but when I started selling things off my own back and using PayPal that\'s when the problems began. It seemed like they had saw a fair amount of money come into my PayPal account and they locked it. The reason they locked it was because of a issue with my wife\'s account (different bank account, only thing we share is an address n name). My wife had sold a phone on ebay, then 6 months after the person who bought it decided to raise a case against her saying he never received the item (Yeah, 6 months after he realised), and PayPal awarded the case to him and my wife was ordered to refund the customer! PayPal agreed to set up a payment plan as she couldn\'t afford the bulk sum. After arguments over email and phone they finally said if my wifes PayPal account was paid off in full mine would be unlocked. So reluctantly I paid it off for her. PayPal assured me mine would be unlocked immediately. This did not happen, then I was told it would take 24hl hours, this also did not happen. After 2 days I checked back and my account had been "permanently locked and I could not appeal the decision due to a customer complaining they had not received items they had bought". They had locked it with £600 of my money in there. I contacted the customer and he assured me he had not complained as he had only made the payment the day prior to all this starting so there was no way the parcel would have arrived so I called PayPal. Most times I called PayPal they were very unhelpful and rude. On this occasion the call handler "dairreh" was very good and he confirmed no complaint had been made and could not understand why my account had been locked. I informed the financial ombudsman of the whole situation and they agreed to help me. After 7 days my account was unlocked but I received no explanation or apology. The case was still open with the ombudsman and PayPal emailed me to say they would look further into it. After about a month they emailed saying they were satisfied the whole situation was now settled and gave me a half hearted apology but accused me of selling things and not paying the fees. After a number of emails and phone calls again I proved them wrong and I in fact were using PayPal in the correct manner all along. I got no apology again.

I bought some bits and pieces from ebay for my card-making hobby. The payments went through without a hitch and I was chuffed as I was planning to use Paypal for some of my online writing activities and this had been my first experience of using them. Being chuffed, however, was a short-lived feeling.\nTwo weeks after making my first transaction, I happened to check my bank account and saw that Paypal had taken £369.99 out. I was shocked but thought that a simple phone call to the company would see the mistake rectified. WRONG!!! It took me 3 attempts and nearly an hour of my time to get past the frustrating voicemail message and actually speak to a person. Needless to say this did little to improve my panic-stricken mindset. Once I got through, the panic didn\'t ease as the representative calmly informed me that they would have to raise a fraud investigation which could take up to 30 days and only then would Paypal decide whether or not my £369.99 would be refunded. I felt like they thought I was trying to pull a fast one and I was angry. Aside from that, because I had had to cancel my bank card, IF I were to be refunded, the transaction could take up to 15 days to reach my account. I was mortified. The only reason they were able to take this amount in the first place was because I had been made redundant the month before. If I\'d still have been in my part time job, I would have been facing overdraft charges and all sorts as my monthly wage would not have allowed for it. Apparently, somebody had bought a Lord of the Rings Lego Tower on ebay (sent to an address in Leicester - I live in Wales) and they had paid for it on my Paypal account as a guest user. Whatever had been bought, however, was irrelevant. The fact remained that somebody had fraudulently hacked my account and I was going to have to wait for six weeks or longer for a refund of money that should never have left my account in the first place. I thought Paypal was safe but obviously I was WRONG again. It was not the news I was expecting to hear and I was close to tears.\nMy main concern, however, was that I originally set up the account for my freelance writing plans, as some sites only pay through the Paypal method, but now, if I were to continue to use them, somebody else may just help themselves to the wages I had worked for.\nFurthermore, until this week when I had an email to say that my claim was closed because my bank had refunded the money pending their own fraud investigation, I had no confirmation from Paypal that they were even investigating my claim. My reply to this email was to point out that regardless of whether my bank had refunded me or not, Paypal\'s investigation should continue as whoever had used my Paypal account had done so fraudulently. I have not received a response... not that I really expected to.\nFinally, as if all of this isn\'t enough, in the past 4 weeks I have had 3 emails saying that I have changed my password on "an unknown device", but the proverbial straw that really broke the camel\'s back was the email I received a week ago stating that "You have sent a payment of £49.12 to (name)"...bearing in mind that I now have no bank account attached to Paypal and they themselves blocked my account when I first reported the unauthorised payment. All in all, I do not trust Paypal or their accounting methods and their customer representatives (when you can eventually get through to one) are neither helpful nor empathetic. I have since carried out some research on alternative providers and there are several out there, so I for one, will not be using Paypal again. One thing it has taught me though is to check my bank account daily and sometimes I check it twice.', 'review_date': '2016-11-26', 'review_time': '00:57:43', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
