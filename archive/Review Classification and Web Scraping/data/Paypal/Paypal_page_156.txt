Terrible customer service. Long waits to speak to anyone. If you don\'t want to call and want help through their message center, don\'t bother, I repeatedly got disconnected from messaging. They DO NOT listen to you. They lie; for example, I used the 6 month financing and my extra payments always gone towards the special finance purchase, then all of a sudden it didn\'t. They said they only do that when it is a month before the promo rate ends. That is a lie because the way I used it, I wouldn\'t have been able to pay it off in one month since I used it for big purchases. I would always make my minimum and then a large amount to pay towards the promo purchase each month for 6 months, every time any extra would go to my promo purchase balance. I called and a rude representative lied to me and said they never had it set up that way and disregarded anything I had to say to him, he gave zero *ucks. Honestly, it seemed like a joke to him, like he enjoyed being disagreeable. I stopped using their credit because this seems very scam like if you ask me. Trying to make a buck by tricking people into interest rates, I\'m all set.\nAnyway, separate issue, I am on hold for an hour now because I can\'t use messaging center, it\'s a waste of my valuable time, the first representative would not listen to me. I repeatedly told him that I sent my daughter $60 two times, and since PayPal would not let her deposit it from PayPal to her bank account she refunded both payments. One $60 charge was deducted from my account, the other was not. The representative kept telling me no, we didn\'t take money out, we covered the charge. Each time I explained to him that I had a $60 withdrawal from PayPal the day after I sent it to her. It was as if he didn\'t listen to me at all because he would repeat the exact same thing like a script "we did not deduct the funds, we temporarily covered the charge for you." Apparently two separate transactions and two refunds was entirely too much for him. I asked him to connect me with someone who would actually listen to me, so here I am waiting and waiting and waiting because of their faulty system and incompetent reps. I\'m canceling my account. They are not worth the hassle. I hate them. Seriously. Hate them. There is more, I just can\'t anymore. I\'m draining myself out typing about their incompetencies. sorry for typos and grammatical errors, I\'m super annoyed at the moment.', 'review_date': '2022-10-06', 'review_time': '18:08:17', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
