The seller required I return the item for a refund, but it would have cost more to return the item then I had actually paid for the item. I NEVER make online purchases without Paypal.

So I opened a second, French account, put in the details of a different card and received a welcome email. But I couldn't use it - I had not been able to enter the (UK) postcode associated with the card because the site was configured only to accept French postcodes - so why no message that the card had not been added? I needed to telephone to find out that French PayPal only accepts French and US cards. It was very hard to obtain this information as the woman on the phone would not stop talking (including when I was trying to talk to her), endlessly repeating the same sentences, doubtless written out for her. I thought I was talking to a machine not a human being.\nAvoid at all costs if you can.\nThey deserve to go bankrupt.\n\nAffreux! Incompétents et extrêmement impolis.
