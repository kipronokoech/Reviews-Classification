I recently used it to fundraise money for the first time. Before I did this I rang customer service, explained I was a novice and told him what I wanted to do, and asked him to help me set up my account.\n\nI successfully fundraised the money, went to transfer it to my bank account, when I discovered I needed to first register my bank account, which would take several working days. I was on a tight timeline and the customer service agent hadn't told me I'd need to do this, or helped me do it that day on the phone with him.\n\nFor me a marker of good customer service is that the person you're speaking to knows what you don't know and can proactively assist you to navigate their service and set-up everything you need to.\n\nSo at the 11th hour I tried to link my bank account. However my bank (Swedbank) has an account number that didn't fit into the field on their website. I rang customer service again and the agent was like 'oh yeah well you need to link your bank account obvs' and then when I told him my problem he said 'oh is it Swedbank? Yeah so you need to just enter the number minus the first two digits' or something like that. And I'm thinking like, why don't they have a drop-down menu where you enter your bank name, at which point the programme recognizes your bank and therefore how many digits your account number will be, and changes the 'enter account number' field accordingly?! Like, do I need to wait over an hour on the phone for someone to tell me how to do it like it's a secret club or something... just seems like SUCH an inefficient system.\n\nIn the end I luckily was able to borrow the money from a friend at the last minute.\n\nThat was a couple of months ago. Fast forward to today and I had some money to transfer PayPal->Bank and I got caught in a verification loop. I rang customer service and she's like, oh yeah we know, it seems to work in the mobile app tho. I explain I'm maxed out on my mobile storage, but wonder out loud whether I can download the PayPal app for my MacBook via the App Store. She's like 'oh yeah sure do that'. I look (with her waiting on the phone) but can't find it there, she's like 'oh yeah it'll be there'. I google it and discover they have the app for mobile and iPad but not MacBook. I tell her this info and say 'this could be good for you to know too'. I'm just... flabbergasted at how incompetent and powerless to help the customer service is. I pray I never need to use PayPal for anything remotely important to me ever again.\n\nFor the record the customer service peeps have always been super nice when I speak to them, I imagine they're probably just underpaid people trying their best with a bad system.", 'review_date': '2022-09-08', 'review_time': '15:49:09', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
