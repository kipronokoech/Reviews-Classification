A very professional lady at PayPal customer care has now fixed and resolved the issue. Very hit and miss with little to no consistency between call staff.\nVery poor fraud prevention resolution\nOne star too many. Abosulute disgrace. To cut a long story short I sold an item on eBay for £280 got an email from PayPal saying that the buyer is possible fraudulent. I phoned PayPal immediately and the fraud team told me the payment was made from unauthorised use of a credit card by the buyer. Asked what I want to do I said refund the money to the poor souls credit card who they have stole from. 2 weeks later PayPal do this but also charge me a £14 Chargeback admin fee. Called the fraud tram again tonight, left me on hold for 10mins to “check it out” and hang up on me. So to summarise I am a victim of fraud, the misused credit card holder is a victim of fraud and PayPal is making money from fraudulent activity through clawing back admin fees. Deeply upset by this.', 'review_date': '2019-02-02', 'review_time': '10:25:19', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

The amount never showed up on PayPal.

Another several weeks later my bank confirms the payment had indeed been credited by PayPal. So back to square one.
