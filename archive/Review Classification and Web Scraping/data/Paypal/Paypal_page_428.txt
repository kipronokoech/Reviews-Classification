No problem with sale buyer paid and a tracking number was placed on the account and the customer left favourable feedback. His money placed on hold for 21 days, even though all the requests to release the money were met. Phoned in as complaint and spoke to adviser who apologised and said the money would be released that same day and any restriction removed from the account. Yet here we are 3 days later with the money still on hold, very frustrated that they are holding money that doesn’t belong to them and obviously my husband is without the money he needed.

You will lose access to your money at some point, and I'm sure you don't want to be in that position.\n\nLook into transferwise or payoneer, as an alternative. Transferwise will absolutely deal with you amicably and help you regain access to your account through a verification process via email. You can deal with an actual human being, and a nice one, at that. They are much more advanced when it comes to professionally dealing with their customers. Also, it's borderless banking - you can access your account from any country, regardless of where you originally opened your account from. Paypal is very behind in this regard and isn't set up to meet these standards - or at least they haven't proven themselves capable of it.\n\nI'm not sure if anyone from paypal actually reads these reviews, but it's evident who's going down first in the fintech world - and it's going to be a hard fall.", 'review_date': '2020-12-24', 'review_time': '17:50:41', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

I had a customer\'s directory subscription renew but who then - after 4+ months into the new subscription period - opened a PayPal buyer\'s dispute process saying they did not receive their merchandise - Case ID: PP-D-91418198. The point being here is that there is NO physical merchandise involved but an intangible item in the form of a yearly subscription.\nSo, I started down the road of having to provide my evidence to PayPal of the service (business listing) I was providing to the customer that they had signed up to. I sent a page document with my evidence to PayPal\'s Resolution Center; including dates, website URLs where the customer\'s business profile was listed. And so I waited...\nAnd I waited... I kept logging into PayPal to check the status of the dispute and still was under review. So I waited...\nI then received an email from Paypal stating "$37,00 USD has now been debited from your PayPal account for the following reason(s): We did not receive proof of fulfillment for intangible items." I not only had the money ($37.00) STOLEN from my account but they gave me a Chargeback charge on top of it!\nTrying to contact PayPal is the worst experience ever! I tried to contact them to dispute the refund but had to eventually go to their Facebook page and make a comment (among the thousands of unhappy customer comments) and eventually received a pat response saying they would escalate it to someone more experienced. And guess what? I never heard a thing.\nPayPal as a service is absolutely diabolical and their customer service is the pits. As a result I cancelled all of my business subscriptions with them and will be moving over to Payoneer.', 'review_date': '2020-12-24', 'review_time': '13:40:17', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
