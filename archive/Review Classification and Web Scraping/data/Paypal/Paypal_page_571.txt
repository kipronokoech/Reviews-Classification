Genetic responses, when you do get in to some sort of conversation the agent decides to start ignoring you, leaving you waiting for ages. You then have to cancel the chat , send them another message and wait another day or so where you have to go through the whole painful experience again. During the process sold another item on eBay. Now that money has gone to cover the deficit from this false claim. Still waiting for it to be resolved. There is no protection for seller, any buyer can make a false claim months down the line.

I‚Äôve written maybe 3 reviews in my entire life but I‚Äôll take the time now to say Pay Pay has the worst customer service I‚Äôve ever experienced. As a third party mediator they are simply BAD. I ordered hiking shoes for my daughter from a site that ( my bad) I should have looked more into since I hadn‚Äôt purchased from them before. But I assumed PayPal made the the transition a little safer. WRONG. Over a month later a pair of shoes shows up without a box or a tag... entirely different shoes...basically just someone‚Äôs old shoes wrapped in packaging. I filed a claim with attached pictures and thought this would be a no brainer. The shoes I ordered were $50 shoes... I wanted my daughter to have a solid pair with good traction, since we had been hiking more... the ones that showed up had no traction; they weren‚Äôt even hiking shoes at all and they were aesthetically horrible. After filing my claim and sending in pictures of what I ordered vs what arrived... they took a month to deny my claim and basically said... ‚ÄúWell they are shoes. We don‚Äôt issue refund if the items are similar.‚Äù Lol... for me it‚Äôs the principle. This was a clear bait and switch. And since then... I can‚Äôt get through to a customer service representative. It‚Äôs just the run around.
