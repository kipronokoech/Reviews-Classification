Does not comply with its own regulation, protects fraudulent sellers, refund system fails, does not comply with international laws, does not comply with GDPR, does not have effective customer support.

They say they respond within 24 hours but never do so, you have to contact several times until you get an answer. If you need to contact Paypal support I advise a screen recording of the entire process and, as soon as you can, close your account and join an alternative service.', 'review_date': '2019-08-30', 'review_time': '10:28:00', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
