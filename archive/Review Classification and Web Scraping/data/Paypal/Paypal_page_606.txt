To sell on there, you need to be verified with Paypal as a seller. I followed all the instructions, and I still wasn't verified. My buyer sent me money that I COULD NOT SEE on my Paypal account even though she sent it to me. I've never heard of a company where you cannot see the money sent to you until you verify your account as a seller. I could make purchases with my Paypal account and see all my expenses, but I could not see the money I got paid. It should at least be a pending payment. Horrible system.\n\nThen there's the fact that the app is inefficient and lacks the necessary information I needed to see if my account was verified. I could not even see at first that there was a spending limit on my account!! I received a refund from a seller over one week ago and it still has not been transferred to my bank account. I'll be surprised if it does get transferred.\n\nI would be alright with all of this if the customer service was good. But the customer support was AWFUL. The worst I have ever experienced in my life. Their phone lines are down during coronavirus. I understand that there is a pandemic going on, but you can't close the phone lines for a money service!! What if someone is getting scammed?? I had to resort to a messaging system with an agent to try and resolve my issue (if you have agents messaging, why can't you have agents ready to respond on the phone?). The first agent I spoke to was absolutely ridiculous. He did not know anything about Paypal. He didn't answer my questions, only gave me weird directions that looked like they had been copied and pasted from a manual. He kept trying to fix an issue that I had not even brought up. He did not know anything about verification on Paypal, and did not seem to have enough access to my account to tell me what was wrong that was making me not be able to see the payment. The second agent I talked to was a lady. She seemed like she had more experience, and recommended I switch to a business account to get verified. I did as she said, and she said I should be verified. I still was not, and a couple of hours later I get a message from Paypal saying that they switched me back to a regular account because I was not a business (I knew I wasn't a business, obviously). These Paypal agents know nothing!!\n\nAt the end, I had to have my buyer cancel her payment because I could not even see the payment or refund her. I lost the money I could have made. I will not be using Paypal to sell ever again. I am in absolute disbelief with their lack of professionalism and lack of service.
