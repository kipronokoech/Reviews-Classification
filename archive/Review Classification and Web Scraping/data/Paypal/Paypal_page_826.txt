Paypal decided to send the payment to the seller by echeque which takes up to a week to clear, even though I paid with a debit card and the money was in my account. When I tried to hurry the payment through so I could get the item they said there was nothing they could do. I purchased the urgently needed plumbing equipment from elsewhere and tried to cancel the holding payment but paypal wouldn't let me. They referred me to my bank and the seller, neither of which could do anything about it as it was paypal who was holding the funds. I eventually spoke to a manager at paypal who assured me that the money wouldn't come out of my account. All lies! I've just checked my account and the payment went out 5 days ago. I just contacted the seller in the hope that he'll refund me. No reply from paypal to my written complaint either. Terrible service in all respects, I'll never use them for online purchases again and will be contacting the FOS shortly if I don't get a refund.", 'review_date': '2018-01-15', 'review_time': '23:28:19', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
