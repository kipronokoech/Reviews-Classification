And I repeat - ths is not shown in the system. HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE?\nSo, the consultant sent me a manual link, where to provide the documents. I provided the document, but they were not ok (because I thougt the I should apply the address of the business not my personal address. This also was not explained), so they denied the documents. I had to call again and do this all over again and upload the updated documents.\n\nLong story short - now they do not accept calls and do not respond to emails and my account is STILL limited.\n\nSo, in my view - they have stolen money from my business.
