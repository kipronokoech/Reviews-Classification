I always used to pay with PayPal as their buyer protection was excellent! Not any more!! The last few times I‚Äôve had to open a dispute, with the same company (Zara) not only have they taken weeks to drag out, I‚Äôve submitted tons of evidence in each dispute and all 3 times they‚Äôve sided with Zara!! Buyer protection literally doesn‚Äôt exist anymore and there is no point using them for anything it‚Äôs so much easier now to just pay with your card and any issue just open a dispute with your bank. Not only have I now deleted my Zara account I will be deleting my PayPal but I hear they don‚Äôt make that easy either so wish me luck', 'review_date': '2023-07-10', 'review_time': '17:23:27', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

The email was very generic and basically just said that my account is limited permanently. Mind you, this is a 3 year old business account for my website that makes between $80-120 a day, every day for the last 3 years with very few issues or chargebacks. When I called to ask why, the lady who "helped" me said that it was flagged by some kind of algorithm, and that she would have it "looked into" and when I asked WHY the account was closed she said that her team has no access to that information and then followed that up with "sometimes in life, these things happen and we just have to move on". Nice customer service, right?. So my account is blocked and they have $1200 of MY money in there. Fast forward to mid-May and I get another email from them, this time it\'s to inform me that they closed another of my business accounts that I have had since the early 2000s.

This led me to the conclusion that I needed to end my relationship with PayPal and close my accounts.\n\nFirst, you cannot truly manage your savings account from the app. This meant dealing directly with their ‚ÄúCustomer Service‚Äù. After several of their attempts to close the savings account spanning more than a month, they tell me that there is a glitch with a lot of accounts that prevent even PayPal itself from closing the account, and apparently I had one of them! I advised them of my legal rights (after a few of their attempts, I spoke with a finance attorney), and demanded that they close the account immediately or I‚Äôd notify my state finance regulatory agency of their denial of my legal right to close it. Somehow, they get as if they had closed the savings account, and even sent me a email stating that it was closed, even though it was NOT. They were still stalling me and trying to talk me out of closing the account. On my next call, they said that my savings account was still open (surprise!), even after they had sent me the email stating that it had been closed. So the next morning, I contacted my state financial regulatory agency, or ‚Äúbanking comptroller‚Äù. This was two days ago. Today, I check the app and I am magically able to delete the entire account.\n\nIn short, PayPal is an overpriced roach-motel. It‚Äôs VERY hard to get away from them once you figure out how much they have been taking advantage of you. I recommend staying away from PayPal altogether. ‚ÄúBad Business Practices‚Äù is very much an understatement.', 'review_date': '2023-07-08', 'review_time': '19:06:56', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
