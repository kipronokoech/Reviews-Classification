I ordered from NaturesEmbrace.net not realizing it was a China company. Paid $70 for an item that was finally delivered no where near the description. PayPal would not back the sale and return my money simply because the China company told me I could return it and they would then see how much money they would give me for a return. According to the reviews I found, this company was only giving people $8-$10 for their return and it took 2-4 months. PayPal feels since naturesembrace.net offered a return, that is good enough. It will cost around $30+ to return the item to China just to see if I get an $8-$10 refund. Absolutely ridiculous!
