Customer service barely speaks English and has zero intention of working with you and absolutely WILL NOT let you speak to a supervisor. I’ve sold on eBay and paid fees to PayPal for years now and all of a sudden they place all of my funds on hold. The worst part is my eBay account won’t allow me to select accepting other methods of payment. That is likely due to the fact ebay and PayPal are owned and operated together. They also take money from your checking account at any given time without asking and never replace it. I had a sale and the buyer paid but wanted to cancel before it shipped as their child ordered it by mistake which is totally understandable. I never transferred the money to my bank account I simply refunded them. I look at my checking account two days later and notice PayPal also “refunded” them from my personal account. I contacted them and they told me it would be available that Thursday and over a week later guess what? NO MONEY FROM PAYPAL YET!!!
