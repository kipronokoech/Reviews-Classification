After using Paypal Business account for 2 months, they suddenly decided to permanently limit my account providing false reasons and told that my funds will be held for 6 months. I was having about $100-$120 in my account, with no chargebacks or refunds history on my account. I tried calling them, they picked up the call and made me feel like I am a criminal because I used Paypal for my business. After having talks for 10-15 minutes, they suddenly hung up the call. I tried contacting them again and guess what, they stopped receiving my calls. I tried messaging them on live chat and everytime I got only bot response . I tried mailing few mails on different email addresses i found from internet and again no reply from them as well. THEY BLOCKED ME COMPLETELY.I was no longer able to talk to real person. So I just decided to wait for 6 months because no option were left at that time. After 3 months what i saw is all my held fund was transferred to thief company PayPal and i was left with 0 balance. Again i was not able to contact them. I tried registering a complaint with BBB and waited for 1 month for their response and finally someone from PayPal replied to my concern. They decided to just keep Limit on my account as it is and decided not to give my money back, because according to them I was a criminal who used Paypal for my legit business. So BBB was not able to help me at all. 2 months passed and I logged in my account to remove my debit card and bank account details. I was not able to remove them even after 6 months. I kept getting message to contact customer care, the customer care which was blocked for me completely. So only way to get their attention on my case was to contact via BBB. I filed a complaint and asked Paypal to let me remove my card and account details. Again after waiting for almost 1 month, I got a ridiculous response. They told me that, "you can\'t remove your details because your account is limited and your card and bank details will stay with paypal forever." Literally, wth is this! They don\'t want my business and don\'t want me to use PayPal but they want my card and bank details. SOUNDS LIKE A THIEF. Isn\'t it? Paypal gave me worst experience of my life. Through this whole process I went through lots of reviews from different websites and found that even LLC\'s and Private LTD companies got Banned from PayPal and even their money were stolen by them.\nSo my suggestion for everyone will be stop using Paypal and completely boycott them. Use Stripe or anything else instead, but not PayPal. This crooks will end up taking your hard earned money away from you. Not sure how they even exists after doing so many robberies. What government is doing to stop them? Is the big question.', 'review_date': '2022-08-09', 'review_time': '06:52:15', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
