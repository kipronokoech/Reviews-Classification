False Advertising!!!', 'message': 'I have been using Paypal for several years, and believed that the company was legitimate and helpful. However, I recently got ripped off by a company who never sent some items to me. It was so unambiguous even their website, which has order updates, clearly showed that the items had not ever been dispatched! I put in a claim, and originally had only ordered from this company because of Paypal\'s "buyer protection scheme" (I thought if they rip me off, which was a distinct possibility, I can get my money back). I filled the forms in, did what I could where (these automatic messages and forms are dated and broken), and emailed Paypal several times to explain I was unable to upload documents but requested where I could instead to support my claim. After a month of the review going back and forth, finally there was a way to upload the files. Then several days later Paypal closed my claim, without notifying me, for the reason "Your documents were not provided in a timely fashion"...\n\nIn a nutshell, they have automated systems which can\'t answer your questions, and when you have trouble using their broken forms for buyer\'s claim they\'ll then reject your claim on the grounds that you didn\'t do what they asked!!!
