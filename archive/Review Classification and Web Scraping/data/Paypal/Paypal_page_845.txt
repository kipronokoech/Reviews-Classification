When selling electronics such as my old iPhone or recently a camera I kind of expect it but am furious that PayPal keep the funds to gain interest and leave me out of pocket with having sold & dispatched the item to the buyer, but PayPal refuse to give me my legitimate money. In two instances the money was critical to solve an issue where we had no option to raise money by selling the phone.\nHowever it now applies to all transactions with PayPal. Sold 2 skirts for less than £5 in total and PayPal are refusing to release those funds now too.\nThe "customer services" department are extremely unhelpful and rude. They offer no seller protection at all. Are they really in such financial turmoil themselves that they have to gain interest by holding every withdrawal transaction for 72+ hours. They\'re excuse of "security reasons" is a well used worn out one that has no standing with us anymore. What about our security as the seller? PayPal demands you send goods regardless of value, so you no longer have the item, and then they refuse to give you YOUR own money to replenish the fact that you\'re now out of pocket.\nThey should be disbanded as a monopoly company and get themselves into the 21st century.\nHow a company can operate like this is beyond us. They have caused us quite some distress with holding our money hostage, and when you attempt to get them to move the process along it results in them dragging their feet even more so.', 'review_date': '2017-07-18', 'review_time': '03:35:16', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
