All transactions are subject to a fee of 2.90% for each transaction that is paid by me. Right now I have thousands of dollars from transactions on hold despite orders being processed weeks ago. When I contacted them to tackle this issue I was requested to enter every freaking tracking number for every transaction on my online store (which is hundreds a day at times!!!!) after which they are "supposed" to release the funds on hold once the product is delivered to a customer. I totally understand this "customer protection" policy and have no issues with it since have not a single complaint from my customers, everyone is perfectly happy with their products ordered from my store. The issue is this "tracking number first and payment after delivery" policy of paypal is nothing else but using my hard-earned money for as long as they want (I have transactions which were delivered 2 weeks ago but money still on hold) Guess what? That\'s not even the end of the story!!! they don\'t have an automated system that would check the delivered items and release the funds on hold. I was told today (paypal customer service) that every freaking tracking detail is checked MANUALLY by an operator before releasing holds. With thousands of business owners like myself and millions of daily transactions it would take them longer than months before they accomplish that! I was even asked to check delivery status of every single transaction myself and email Paypal every time when the order is delivered to a customer. This is just totally ridiculous! Why should I be wasting my precious time checking every transaction (100s a day) and writing Paypal the status of every single delivery???? Such a disappointing service and totally unreliable company. They are taking advantage of being the only company with such a service and doing whatever they wish and holding others\' money as long as they want, which is totally UNFAIR! I wish Aussies had another option apart from PayPal which would end the monopoly!', 'review_date': '2021-03-15', 'review_time': '00:37:35', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
