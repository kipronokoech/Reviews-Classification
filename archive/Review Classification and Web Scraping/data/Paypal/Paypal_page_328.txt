Little did I know the email address assigned to that icon was somehow changed to an unknown recipient and the money went to a scammer. Unfortunately you cannot verify an email address until AFTER you do a money transfer. Reported this to PayPal and they said to contact the recipient and request that they return the money. I attempted to do exactly that only to find the email account was suddenly deleted. Sounds like a scam to me but apparently it means nothing to PayPal. After talking to an Indian rep who couldn\'t understand my problem, I requested to talk to a supervisor from the US. They never bothered to honor that request. Instead they offered to "meet in the middle" and offered a $100 voucher. I tried to explain how I believe there is a defect in their system that allows this type of scam but they refused to admit it. They abruptly closed the case making it virtually impossible to go further with the complaint. They are truly ignorant of the weak links in their system and could care less about their scammed client. It\'s obvious they don\'t want to admit defects in their system and their need to correct them. They are the absolute worst when it comes to customer service.', 'review_date': '2021-05-25', 'review_time': '14:24:59', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
