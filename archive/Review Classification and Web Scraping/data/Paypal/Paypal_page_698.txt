No they don\'t and management is the same way. They told me the dispute is now with them but they would write to her to try to retrieve the $470 overpayment.

I rarely write reviews but after the discussion I just had with an employee at PayPal I will be closing my account and running my business through another provider. This causes me extreme frustration because it will alter the payments I receive from every one of my clients. They decided to put a hold on my account for 21 days... 21 days that I would not be able to receive any payments?! There is no notification of this to the "buyer" and it took some digging to even get an idea of why this hold exists on my end (service provider). Eventually I called and this woman went in circles with every excuse you could come up with- I was even told "it is in the small print!"-Which to me is just funny because if you have to hide the fact that you can retain my money for three weeks whenever it conveniences you, well- that is just crazy and frankly a bit sketchy. She was also extremely rude to me in general, it was like she answered the phone ready for war, yikes.\n\nAnd yes, I had previous goods and services come through my account with no issues, I have never had any bad standing for any reason and the account has been up and functioning for plenty of time. So after hearing about how they want to "protect their buyers" I can now see that their service providers mean little to them, as there is no form of protection in a random hold of my finances. Just don\'t do it friends.\n\n**Edit- after reading other comments it seems they don\'t even protect their buyers, so basically it is just terrible all around.
