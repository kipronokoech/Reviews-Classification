Paypal failed to do due diligence in setting up an account for this scammer. If they had done any due diligence they would have discovered that the site was set up by Go Daddy just 24 days before (and has already been disconnected), the phone#s and email addresses as published on their fraudulent site, and as given to Paypal don\'t even "exist" and the address they gave Paypal is an empty lot. Paypal acknowledges we got nothing for the $13.99 but they state: "after having reviewed all the details, and based on the information we have to date, we have to deny your case. This decision was made because your billing dispute doesn\'t match our qualification for a billing dispute." When we asked what matches their billing dispute, the answer was reimbursement is at their discretion. So even if they set up a scammer (without even doing the most minimal verification that the vendor is real), and if that scammer then fails to acknowledge an order or ship anything - it is not Paypal\'s responsibility.\n--------------------------------------------\nHere\'s the Paypal info on this fake vendor - Kansestore.site; name at Paypal is\nngo quoc thinh chercampurap\n\nAnd here is our follow up to their denial of claim:\n\n3/11/20- Our bank investigated the vendor in this case. We were advised that Paypal was reckless in setting up an account as a) the website site was registered with GoDaddy just 24 days prior, b) email on file with GoDaddy is fake, c) the phone/email/address on the Kanse Store website and as provided to Paypal were all fake as well, d) Paypal did not even investigate if business had a legitimate license as a short call to Union City CA indicates that there is no business license for this entity/person, and the street address is invalid. Failure to provide user protection and to do due diligence in setting up new "vendor" accounts is why Paypal\'s reputation is plummeting and why consumers should avoid using Paypall. We are shutting down your checking account to prevent further fraudulent withdrawals. Once Paypal refunds your funds to the Paypal account, you can withdraw the funds and deposit it in your new checking.\n\nIn addition to the message from our bank, a few hours later we received a report from a scam expert company engaged (at no charge) to further investigate Kanse Store aka ngo quoc thinh Here is their message:\n\nDate: Wed, Mar 11, 2020 at 7:46 PM\nSubject: Re: is "Kanse Store" legit or fraud?\nMy name is xxx and I am the Senior Scam Expert here at ScamExperts.com. I am reaching out to you in regards to the scam inquiry submitted on Mar 10, 2020 09:41 pm about Kanse Store.\n\nAfter a thorough investigation, we have determined the offer to be a SCAM attempt and we highly recommend you take the following steps:\n\n1) Immediately cease all communication with the scammer.\n2) Block their phone numbers, email address and/or websites.\n3) DO NOT send them any money.\n4) If PayPal has already sent them payment, contact Paypal immediately and have them stop or reverse the payment.\n----------------------------------------------------\nSO THE QUESTION THE CONSUMER MUST ASK IS WHY CAN A BANK AND A FREE SCAM EXPERT DISCOVER A SCAM IN less than 24 hours but Paypal cannot figure it out either before setting up the scammer\'s account or after a consumer submits a complaint????\n\nPaypal is either incompetent or they just don\'t care.', 'review_date': '2020-03-13', 'review_time': '01:23:02', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

Again, I asked them for information concerning the use of my personal information and was informed again they could not provide me with this information as I could not verify the email provided on the account.

They enable fraudulent transactions and then side with the crooks because you (unknowingly) enable reoccurring payments to the vendor when you make what you believe is a one time payment. In one case I had cancelled by service with a hosting company half way through an annual term; then with no active services, the hosting company charged my PP account on the anniversary date and PP denied my dispute. My second example is another hosting company that ceased operations, ie went out of business during my prepaid annual service and then was able to proceed and charge my PP account on the annual anniversary date. PayPal HIDES the information of what pre-authorized payments you are subscribed to and CHOOSES not to give customers any advance notification of upcoming re-occurring payments. WHY because it benefits PayPal to support/side/enable those which generate their revenue. In my case I am being scammed by being charged for services which I am not receiving and PayPal is ok with that because they are making money.', 'review_date': '2020-03-12', 'review_time': '01:56:35', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
