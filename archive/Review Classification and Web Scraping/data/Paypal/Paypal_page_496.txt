They used to be alright. I guess things started going wrong 12-18 months ago. Their first major problem is their development team. Second only to the Amazon development team they are the most incompetent coders on the Internet. It\'s just one problem after another; I haven\'t got the time to list all their problems here, but essentially they lack basic development skills.\n\nTheir second problem, equal to their first, is their so-called "customer service". They never answer questions directly, you will have to constantly repeat yourself, and you will have to go through 6-12 different agents before someone sensible comes along and addresses the original query. You will get cut-and-paste replies, which won\'t address your query properly for 95% of the time. Sadly, English is never the first language of the agents, I think they run everything through google-translate. Their agents also have a low intelligence, equivalent to the average 10 year-old child. I\'ve had queries take place over weeks, and one query took 3 months of my daily complaints before someone with actual knowledge of the problem I presented came along to fix it over the space of an hour.\n\nI have also been let down by them several times recently concerning their "buyer protection". Again, too much to go into, I don\'t believe I have buyer protection with them anymore; there are loopholes in the system which will favour the seller, once you figure out what they are. I\'m not going to disclose them here.\n\nI have PayPal credit with my account, and the other day I had a minimal payment for about £100 which was set to be paid via direct debit. But 7 days before the payment date I sent an early payment of £150. That payment didn\'t clear until 8 days later (conveniently), and then they took the direct debit anyway!? The money had actually left my bank account after 5 days. What the hell goes on in the world where I tap a few ones and zeros into my computer and it takes 8 days to arrive on someone else\'s? No digital transfer should take more than 3 days to complete. Of course, bank to bank is relatively instant these days. Seemingly PayPal are just not up to speed in terms of technology. Unless they do "odd stuff" with my funds over these 8 days? In this modern age these durations are unacceptable. Money from PayPal account to bank account is instant, as it should be.\n\nI keep saying to them that something fishy is going on at their company. It\'s possible they have been infiltrated by their competitors and are trying to take PayPal down from the inside. Or it is some kind of internal decision to push their customers away to other money transfer companies. The reasons for this I can\'t quite fathom. Maybe in years to come we\'ll see why PayPal ran itself into the ground pushing customers elsewhere.\n\nI\'ve been with them for about 15 years, I can\'t wait to finally get rid of them, they cause me nothing but stress and hassle. But I should stress, these problems only started 12-18 months ago.', 'review_date': '2020-09-30', 'review_time': '09:11:10', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
