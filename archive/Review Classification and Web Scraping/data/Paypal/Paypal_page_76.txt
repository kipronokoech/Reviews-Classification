I\'ve had so many conflicting reasons but the latest being because my ID name doesn\'t match my account name, well that really is the final straw and you wonder if anyone at PayPal even knows how to read customer messages of whether absolutely everything is computer based.

In 2020 I briefly used an antivirus tool that I paid for using paypal. I cancelled the service and the virus tool did not seem to work anyways (Total AV). The following year they did not charge me anything since I had cancelled 11 months earlier. Then in 2022 they charged me suddenly 160 dollars with a made up annual plan that I have never signed and that they could not prove in any court. And this is several credit cards later...would never happen with my regular bank. But I selldom use paypal so I did not even see it. Now I happened to log in a few days ago to see that a monthly donation is still on but they had cancelled the donation but agreed to having Total AV charge my account 2 years in a row. I made a complaint and thought everything would be solved at least this year since it was only 3 days after they charged me. I also called in to customer service on the 11:th to see how it was going and they told me to just wait and see. So I called again today and now they said that I hadn´t answered a mail that they sent before the 11:th so they had closed my complaint and it was impossible to make another one. So the complaint was from the 7:th to the 14:th, so seven days and because I did not see their mail they refuse to help me and shut everything down after only seven days, knowing that this other Total AV is a scam party and believing everything I told them. The customer service was also rude the last time and almost started yelling because I questioned their methods. So if you did not know Paypal 100 procent supports scam artist and poor peole like me who struggle every month to make ends meet will have to pay these scam artists. I don´t know if there are better alternatives out there instead of paypal but I will never use those evil people again. So paypal has stolen 300 dollars from me which is a lot for mer.

The debit card and robot bs being so annoying just to try asking questions to see when I'm going to have enough for a debit card cause no more than 2 more and if you still fail tremendously and I don't get a debit card I'll only use the PayPal account for companies I get paid fast and I will not give y'all a chance ever if I do turn my back. Y'all forgot who your company is and the main point that made y'all best now id consider closing my doors cause your platforms board line useless and no debit card gives me reason to use less not more for one. If you value your business you would still give them for ease and proving you want us to stay all your doing right now is giving me a headache making everything such a freaking issue and so much more difficult than it needs if you want to keep my business. Shouldn't need a migraine pill every time I exit my account it's so ridiculous I'm completely and utterly disappointed and I would give 0 stars if it was an option. Please either get your old ways back or go away because otherwise your nothing and gonna end up disappearing like you have already a lot but your still able to come back with little room left to change if don't hurry.. your company is entirely different from the core values that made your company awesome and you certainly lose this business if you don't fix these really big issues. I'm not going to pop Excedrin but possibly 1 more time before completely writing off the useless headache unless necessary and only option.
