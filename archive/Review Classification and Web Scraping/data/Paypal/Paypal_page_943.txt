I can honestly say I feel extremely safe using my own highstreet chain bank online, the security is superb but if the company I am buying from online uses Paypal, then I use them instead. The depositing system on registration is as particular as my own banks card reader and password system and without the likes of Paypal, I believe I would be more subject to online payment hacking. Paypal is attached to some well known places who I shop with, such as: Boots, Ebay, PKR, Lexmark, Hotel Chocolat, Superdrug, Avon Cosmetics, Argos, Sports Direct, Nike.com, BHS, Wilkinsons, Liverpool FC and many more.
