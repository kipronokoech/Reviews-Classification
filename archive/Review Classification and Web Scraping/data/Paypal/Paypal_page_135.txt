Anyho, unfortunately the advisor seemed to have little knowledge about this matter and furthermore, rather than connecting me to someone who could helped, he just said he couldn’t help at that moment! The reason I used the app was because at a glance it said “money transferred in minutes” but when I got to the point of transfer it then said “transfers could take up to 72hrs” now that was Wednesday, 16thNov. It showed up today and guess when? As I went on the app it asked me for a review and after writing this once already, just when I went to check my facts at my banking app. I not only lost my review but as if by magic the funds suddenly appeared(lol).. I also received an email from PayPal stating the second part of my review(could take 72 hours depending). Now I am not saying this is in anyway deceptive but I would say it at best is misleading as if I didn’t see that money in minutes boast, I wouldn’t have used the app!! So folks to end I will say maybe call PayPal to find out how long your transfer will take before using… As my transfer took from Wednesday to Saturday(just now) and just as I was about to send this review which suddenly dissapeared and I then had to write it again!! 72hrs almost dead on give and take a few minutes!!
