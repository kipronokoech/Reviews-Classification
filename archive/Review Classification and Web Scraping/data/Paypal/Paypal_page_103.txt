Currently compiling a report on user experiences of paypal. So the good thing was to try them myself. Deposited around £40 purchased crypto currency, an option I've been hearing so many complaints about and was tied up in repeated failed attempts to first sell the currency (at vital moments), but also was tied up in this process where you try to withdraw your money, are placed in what was described as a 'risk' queue for 24hrs. Note: at this point I'm trying to withdraw to my linked and verified account. I tried the next day same thing. However, on advise from someone who'd complained to me I tried to transfer my money to someone else's account. Which I did after paying paypal £1.99. Low and behold it goes through. Quite what paypal is trying to 'protect' people from with this protocol I do not know, but it seems their concern fails the moment you do something with more 'risk', but presents a fee. But no more. If anyone else has similar stories and would like to become part of a wider legal case against them then please write to me at: Clive Pullen 350 Canterbury Street Gillingham Kent me75jp.

She then went quiet and then asked me to confirm my birthdate TWICE. A few minutes later she told me she was opening up a case with PayPal and that I would get an email from them once the issue was resolved. Before hanging up she said “You will have to submit another form of I.D. that is not expired”……………needless to say I went looking for another way I could contact PayPal and decided to DM them on instagram. They responded very quickly on there and ultimately they said I would no longer be able to work with PayPal and that “we take time to review decisions so we assure you the decision to limit your account was not made hastily”. I wanted to scream at my phone after reading that. PayPal sucks, for lack of a better word, ass. Extremely unhelpful and can’t even undo a mistake they made.
