They told me it had become "unverified" and had to be verified by them with me calling in. They could not explain to me why it became unverified suddenly, and could not answer if it would happen again. They just kept dodging questions and talking in circles and it drove me NUTS. Just wasted my time and acted like I was crazy for being upset. I asked to talk to a manager and GOT HUNG UP ON.\n\nSo, I decided to close my account. This is how I learned basically all of their customer support is incompetent, and it wasn\'t just bad luck before. I could not close my own account because for whatever reason, I had a -0.01 USD balance and +0.01 AUD balance, and despite showing a 0.00 overall balance, this odd discrepancy was preventing my account from being closed. I tried to transfer the AUD to USD, but it failed and just said it can\'t be done right now.\n\nI was told by Customer Service that they couldn\'t fix the issue, and transferred me to Collections, and I was transferred back and forth like this for over an hour with NO HELP WHATSOEVER. They just kept saying it was the other teams problem. I finally landed someone competent from Customer Service who was able to close my account, but by this point I can\'t recommend PayPal to ANYONE. Awful, unorganized, uncommunicative customer support who just try to get you off the phone any way that they can because they don\'t actually know how to do anything. They will make stuff up like "oh our system probably needs to update, give it a few days and try again!" For an issue that had existed for over a year. They will try anything to get you off the phone so that the next agent will have to try fixing it instead of them.\n\nThis whole awful experience was over several different days and SEVERAL HOURS of being treated like crap by many different incompetent support people.', 'review_date': '2023-09-13', 'review_time': '23:06:28', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
