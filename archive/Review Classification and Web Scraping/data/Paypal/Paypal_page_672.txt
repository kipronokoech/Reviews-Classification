The plan was once I encashed the money I will commence work.\n\nFast forward to December 26, 2019, and after more than a month-long debacle with Paypal, the "missing" funds appeared on my Paypal wallet deducted with all the charges they can think. Trust Pilot was my key for Paypal to take action.\n\nSo I withdrew the funds yesterday, and I got it to my account today. So I corrected my review of Paypal in Trust Pilot. I was so happy that the funds reflected right away. I encashed the funds and started paying for the things that I need for the project. After a long day\'s work and too many promises settled, Paypal sent me a dispute letter from the client that they withheld the funds and told me that the client did not authorize the transaction.\n\nPaypal are you our of your mind?! How come the client did not authorize the transaction when he was the one who paid the invoice in the first place. The only reason I can think of him filling a dispute is that because he doesn\'t trust me any longer, which was caused by your greed and incompetence in the first place.\n\nHow can you file a dispute when I waited and pleaded for the client for more than a month when you made money with his money? In the end, it should be you Paypal who should refund to him and pay me compensation for damages as well. As of today, I am already branded as a fraud by a client which I don\'t even have control over the money you never deliver.\n\nPlease tell me what to do as I am at the receiving end of grievances caused by you? Shouldn\'t you recompense to me too?', 'review_date': '2019-12-27', 'review_time': '14:08:57', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
