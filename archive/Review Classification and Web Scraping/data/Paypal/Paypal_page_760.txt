If it were not for these two payers, I would not touch PayPal with a 100-foot pole. First, after several years with an account and no problems, they SUDDENLY absolutely HAD to have a copy of my driver\'s license and other completely PERSONAL information in order for me to ADD MONEY FROM MY OWN CHECKING ACCOUNT TO MY OWN PAYPAL ACCOUNT. So, one useful function gone.\n______________________\nUPDATE, JULY 2019:\nNow, my PayPal account has LOST ALL FUNCTIONALITY. I have had small amounts deposited to my PP account over many years, and I usually use the money when I want to make a small donation to some non-profit. Today, I was going to pay a small bill ($12) using the balance in my PP account, and was told that I could not to so. After trying to explain this issue to an on-line chat person, I came away with the following information: unless I supply PP with my social security number, a copy of my driver\'s license, and other highly personal information, I can no longer use PP as a payment method.\nGiven that there are now at LEAST five different options for people to send cash to each other, you\'d think that PP would be bending over backwards to keep business, not turn it away, wouldn\'t you? Also, given all of the data breaches happening all over the place, you\'d think that the LAST thing they\'d want is for people to be sending them copies of their personal information on-line.\nWell, at least I was able to ask for the money to be deposited into my checking account. I\'m just sorry that the MINIMAL functionality of my PayPal account is, for all intents and purposes, completely gone.\n\nThen, they very unfortunately took over E-Bay, and I have had NOTHING BUT PROBLEMS with my E-Bay account since. For instance, I opened an E-Bay branded credit card to earn extra points when I buy something on e-Bay. When PayPal took over, I suddenly could no longer log into my E-Bay credit card unless I went through the PayPal portal -- not safe, in my opinion.\n\nNext, I found out that EVERY time I tried to use my new E-Bay credit card, the system kept telling me that it was an invalid card. So, I\'d use one of my other cards and the purchase would go through. So my E-Bay co-branded credit card is useless on the one site where I wanted to use it.\n\nFinally, getting through to PayPal "customer service" is a nightmare! Just FINDING a way to contact them without being on hold forever is practically impossible, and, when you do send them an e-mail, their first response is to send you some long boilerplate which DOESN\'T come close to solving your problem. When/if you get a "real person" to read your complaint, their solution is to call!\n\nIf PayPal is unavailable via the internet and only allows contact via phone, then they shouldn\'t even try to make believe that they are an on-line company. Oh, and I just got a long-winded e-mail about them changing their modus operandi, again. I don\'t have a clue what they\'re changing, or what the new account to which I have to couple my old account is supposed to do -- other than the trying to pry more personal information out of me which I don\'t want an untrustworthy mega-giant company to have.', 'review_date': '2019-07-14', 'review_time': '22:28:47', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
