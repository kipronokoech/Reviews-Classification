Nice joke', 'message': 'PayPal is the worst multi billion company when we talk about support in conflicts. They request from a seller a lot information about shipment and the article which was delivered just to ignore everything in the end. Guess what? They don\'t care. It doesnt matter if you have done everything right. If there is a chargeback on the other side - you are doomed. Paypal decides regardless on what evidence you give that you did everything right on your end about your money. Paypal support: We can\'t do anything. But taking away the money from honest sellers is something you ALWAYS can. "Safest place to send & receive money" my a**. Do yourself a favor guys and stay away from this if you are a seller. Paypal supports scam attempts way to heavily always in favor of buyers.
