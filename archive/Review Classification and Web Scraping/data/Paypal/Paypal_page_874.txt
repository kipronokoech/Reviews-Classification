{'platform': 'Paypal', 'id': '571671a70000ff0009524c96', 'stars': 1, 'title': 'A horrible company', 'message': 'PayPal Credit is a JOKE! I am trying to purchase a rare drum set off of Ebay. The drums are 1 of the only 50 that will be released in the US. I applied for credit through PayPal Credit and was allowed $2750. That was prefect the drums I was trying to purchase was $2650. So I go through the process of proving my identity. Sending in proof of address, ID and linking my bank account. This process took a hour and half by it\'s self. So I get it all done and go to the invoice sent to me and click to pay with PayPal Credit. It goes through fine and then all of a sudden I get a alert from the bank that they tried to take the $2650 out of my BANK account twice leaving me with two NSF charges. I call PayPal Credit they send a letter to give to bank so that the charges can be reversed. Okay, I was good it was a mistake and it was fixed. No big deal. And then the nightmare really begins. PayPal Credit instructs me to make a small purchase first, so I do. It was for $8 and it still won\'t go through. I call back and she says wait till tomorrow and try again. I do and still nothing. And then they take the purchase out of my bank account. They explain they are sorry. And I let it go because it was only $8. Then I am instructed to try to send the funds in smaller amounts directly to the merchant instead of through the invoice. I explain to them that I didn\'t feel comfortable with that because I didn\'t want that amount drafted out of my BANK account. So I go through the process of removing the Bank account from the PayPal Credit account. I am instructed to wait 24 hours so the system can reset. I do that. I tried to pay $20 on the $2650 invoice and still wont work. Try a few more times, a few different ways and still not working. Call back and I am told they have changed something and I should be fixed in a hour. Try then and then call back if there is a problem. So of course I try three hours later and it still doesn\'t work so I call back again. This time I am told they reset the system and I need to wait a few days for it to work. So I do so. And nothing. Today I am told that I need to make a history with PayPal Credit before I can make a large purchase. I explained that PayPal Credit wouldn\'t even let me use $8, so how can I make a history. So I am closing the credit account. PayPal Credit gives you credit that you can\'t use, blame their customers for a poor system, and will feed you BS just to get you to call back and talk to another person so they don\'t have to deal with it. Sadly the purchase I was trying to make was very important to me or I would have never applied for the credit through PayPal. So beware PayPal credit is not for a purchase of a item "YOU" want. They give you credit and tell you that you have establish credit with PayPal Credit in order to use the credit they give you. If that is the case they should start a credit limit at a lower amount and up it as you establish the history they want. The worst experience I have ever had with a company.

{'platform': 'Paypal', 'id': '5713328a0000ff000951535e', 'stars': 1, 'title': "Didn't refund me but the seller did refund me in the end!!!", 'message': 'I had an "amazing" experience with Gearbest (seller) and Paypal. I have already wrote a review for Gearbest about this experience so i decided to write a review for Paypal as well. To be fair, i will copy-paste my Gearbest\'s review here.\n\n\nOn 05.02.2016 i placed the order W1602050620259201 which consists of one Xiaomi RedMi Note 2 32GB Prime. I ordered this from their European warehouse which is located on the United Kingdom as they told me. I preferred to pay more money for the item so as to be sent out from the European warehouse as i was in a hurry to get the phone to my hands.\nOn the 17.02.2016 i received an email from Gearbest stating that they shipped out my order with tracking number RR283279317HU. On the 20.02.2016, the tracking number\'s status changed to "Item data received". As you can all imagine, the item has yet to arrive while the tracking number\'s status has not been updated so far.\nThe worst thing is that when i contacted Gearbest for support (ticket number: T16030505899) they told me not to worry because they had handed over my order to the courier company. This was something that was contradictory to the order\'s tracking number status which up until now, almost two months after i placed my order, has not updated. I immediately contacted the Hungarian Post and they told me that they have not received the parcel from the seller yet. So, who am i suppose to believe now? I think you can all imagine who i tend to believe...\nBy now, i am pretty sure that my order got lost or that Gearbest never handed it over to the Hugnarian Post. Either way, it has been nearly two months since i placed my order from Gearbest\'s European warehouse and the item has yet to begin its journey. Gearbest still won\'t admit that something is wrong with my order though i informed them that i would be opening a case on Paypal. So, i was forced to open a case on Paypal on 16.03.2016 which i escalated on a claim on 19.03.2016. On the 23.03.2016 Gearbest sent the tracking information (which i already knew) to Paypal and Paypal informed me about it. Now, i am at Paypal\'s mercy and i really hope that they make the right choice.\n\nUPDATE #1: On 28.03.2016 Gearbest replied via the ticket system telling me (to my big surprise) that the order was sent out via Surface Mail WITHOUT tracking number and that my order can take up to 90 days to arrive. This is unacceptable since i paid more money to them so they would ship my order from the European warehouse! I ordered the item from the European warehouse for a reason which was not to waste money but for it to arrive sooner and not having to pay any custom fees. From what it seems they took the initiative to send the item from warehouse outside Europe. Now, they offered to partially refund me for the extra shipping cost but the thing is that not only i paid extra shipping cost for the item to be shipped out of the European warehouse but for the product as well because the product on the European warehouse itself was more expensive than the one that was being sold from the Chinese or the Hong Kong warehouse. Furthermore, i am not interested in a partial refund of the shipping fees but in my product arriving here in time which didn\'t happen. I think their behavior is unacceptable because they made a mistake and i had to open a claim on dispute and write about my experience here to get their attention and the truth about my order. The worst thing about their reply is that they asked from me to wait for the order to arrive until 17.05.2016 which is SO unacceptable for the reasons that i have explained before.\n\nUPDATE #2: On 28.03.2016 i replied to Gearbest asking them if i understood correctly about my order not being shipped from the European warehouse but from another one.\nOn 29.03.2016 i received a reply telling me that the actually did ship my order from the European warehouse (!!!) and asked me to wait for 5-7 working days so they could investigate the problem. I replied immediately to them telling them that this is not acceptable by me and i won\'t wait any minute longer and that i want a full refund right away!\nOn 30.03.2016 they got back to me, telling me that sometimes orders from the European warehouse may take up to 90 days to arrive and asked me to give them more time. They also told me that they would refund me if i didn\'t want to give them more time and asked me that i would sent them back the refunded money when i receive the product.\nI replied telling them that i agree on getting a full refund on my Paypal account so i can place another order as my initial one apparently got lost. I also told them that if i ever get the product from the initial order, i would be more than happy to sent the initial order back to them if they agree on paying the return shipping fee as i won\'t be needing two identical devices.\nOn 31.03.2016 they replied telling me that they applied for a full refund through the Paypal case. One hour later, they sent me again telling them that "after confirming with their financial staff, the deadline is expired and they could not proceed the refund". They also told me that since Paypal has been involved in this, we should wait for Paypal\'s judgement and if they win this case they would fully refund me anyway.\nSo, from what they are telling me, they are willing to fully refund me. I cannot understand the "deadline" reason for which they won\'t.\n\nFINAL UPDATE: on 08.04.2016, Paypal sent me an email informing me that they closed my claim in Gearbest\'s favor (!!!!!!). They wrote to me the following:\n"Your seller has provided shipment tracking information in response to your claim. We used the shipping company\'s online tracking service and found that it confirms delivery of the merchandise. As a result, this case has been closed. We\'re happy we were able to help you resolve this issue."\nI contacted Gearbest via their ticket system, telling informing them about the outcome of the case and asking them to refund me as they had promised. Fortunately, Gearbest refunded me!!!\nConclusion: Gearbest takes 3 stars because they wouldn\'t help me in the first place. I had to open a case on Paypal and share my experience with you via TrustPilot so they would co-operate. I will give them another change though. I have already placed other orders on Gearbest. 1 star though for Paypal for not deciding the case in my favor. I truly believe that Paypal\'s handling over this matter is laughing material.
