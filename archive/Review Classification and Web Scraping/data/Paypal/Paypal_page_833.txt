No I paid with Paypal to be secure and did not allow my bank information to be held. Even though I cancelled the service months ago, I was billed again, I filed a dispute immediately, it was denied because Paypal says they have permission to bill my bank regardless of my not having authorized a charge. This is something in your settings with them so apparently they can hit your bank even if you did not authorize the charge. This is nothing more than fraud.

Are You Protected? Please Read this.\nIMPORTANT!!!\n\nMy Most lowing items has being on the transport open to all transport risk damage and lost issues because of Ebay and Paypal\'s mismanagement, irresponsible attitude towards your\'s most concerns..And THEY CONCLUDE WITH A HUMILIATING DECISION WITHOUT ASKING ANY PROOF OF EVIDENCE FROM BOTH PARTIES. Evidence from sellers and from the buyers.\n\nI sold an item on 21 Feb 2017 . Cost of the item was originally over £2,240.00 reduced by £200.00 for a real interest showing buyer\'s extra demanding. I managed the reduced the item\'s price extra £200.00 because I received very low seelers fee offers at the time from ebay . I also believed the buyer looks decent from his feeds. He paid by paypal right after we agreed and I lowered the price on ebay.I sent it with 24H Express Parcel Force . My BEST AND MOST LOVING highly collectable 150. Anniversary edition ,Hand made Classic Gold Edition Carl Zeiss Binocular less than 1000 made all over the world especially registered Serial Number was also display on ebay site has arrived next day to the buyer\'s address. .\n\nFirst buyer sent me an email said " He didn\'t like the item . I sent him an email ; The item has being photographed from many angle and described clearly and also sold under "No Returns Accepted" ... Then after a few email exchanged between us I told him OK, If you are not happy with it one condition I will accept the item back and refund you in full with less P&P cost . And you must send the item straight away with all original packing together and with full postage tracking . Seems we have been agreed but Then Same day he open the case against me on ebay said ; "He didn\'t like the item ", Then he realised he hasn\'t got any case in his hand , BECAUSE EBAY \'s No Returns Accepted POLICY without reasonable evidence ..He changed his mind and then he open the case on PAYPAL !. This time he claimed on Paypal Resolution; " He received different item not the same item as on the listing". Then Paypal without asking any evidence from him or from me to proof of the difference of the received or sent items photo...\nPaypal dictated me to repay him back immediately. I was in shock!! So many times I CALL PayPal and TRY TO EXPLAIN IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO RECEIVED DIFFERENT ITEM THEN THE ONE DISPLAYs on ebay WITH MANY PHOTOGRAPHS AND ALSO SERIAL NUMBER OF THE ITEM . No response !.\nThen I turn back to ebay ,telling them " How could be possible to open another case while he was claiming from ebay resolution saying " He didn\'t like the item " then now open the case from Paypal this time he is claiming " Item he received id different then the photo display on ebay" REPLAY FROM EBAY PERSONAL IS SHOCKING ;She said to me because item value is higher than £500.00 that\'s why now Paypal is taking the case !.. I asked "isn\'t anybody is going to ask this man to provide an evidence if the item he received is different !?" No responses..\n\n.So I didn\'t have no option to accept the refund the buyer.\nBuyer was happy to get refund with less P&P. And he luckily sent my item back ,condition was ok. but this time I couldn\'t refund his money back because PayPal hold that money 3 weeks and 3 weeks every day I had to replay buyers refund demanding emails .That was a nightmare ,worst experience I ever had.That items was a really special I paid £2,500.00 cash at the time year 1996. I never touch it with my bare hand ,it has never used \'\n\n"LIMITED EDITION ZEISS 10 x 40 B CLASSIC GOLD\nA notice in July 1996: "Carl Zeiss is offering a limited edition 10x40mm B "150 Year Anniversary" binocular which will feature Gold plating, and a custom case. Production is expected to be 1,000 units or less. If you have to ask the price, then you can not afford it. Company Seven will accept orders for this instrument for those who wish to make the highest fashion statement!". Now this has become a reality:\nOn 14 November 1996 the U.S. Carl Zeiss Optical company formally announced the availability of a limited edition binocular specially produced to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the Carl Zeiss company. The binocular selected for this program is possibly the most successful, and popular of the Zeiss Dialyt series.\n\nOnly 1,000 of the "Zeiss 10 x 40 B ClassiC Gold" binoculars will be made. Finished in the finest grade of Nappa Leather in brown, with the serialized current ZEISS logo in 18 carat gold, the eyepiece and objective rings in 18 carat gold plate, in a deluxe brown leather case with snap closure, and a personalized wood presentation box bearing the owners name.\nEach instrument will be available for sale at $3,395.00.
