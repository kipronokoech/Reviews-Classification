A few weeks ago I purchased an item that turned out to be faulty but due to the Christmas period I hadn\'t gotten round to using it for 30 days before I found the fault. So that left me with no choice but to chase the seller through a Paypal case. The item was described as "fully working" but it totally didn\'t work, nothing worked on it at all. I opened a PP not as described case and after 3 days the case got closed all of a sudden, even though it had said the seller has 8 days to respond, out of the blue I got an email saying the case had been closed against me with no seller response whatsoever. I emailed PP customer service 3 times about why this was and ignored each time. £170 just wasted thanks to them.\n\nNow this week I had a seller open a PP case against me. They had already told me their item was and I quote "perfect" but 3 months later messaged me saying can they return as they no longer want it. I said no as my returns policy is 30 days and they opened a Paypal case making up some stupid false reason. I responded to the case and said that they had told me it was perfect when they got it and its been 3 months now.\n\nGuess what. Paypal has now reviewed the case and found against me once again! Refunding my buyer £359 out of my account! This is absolutely outrageous and disgusting double standards by Paypal. The item didn\'t go against their terms as significantly not as described but yet they decide that.\n\nAbsolute robdogs paypal, just depends who reviews the case over at Payscampal doesn\'t matter about their rules. Then there\'s nothing you can do about it. As for the case I opened I am now in the process of using my bank to chargeback the transaction so you won\'t have the last laugh PAYSCAMPAL.\n\nDirty foul company', 'review_date': '2020-01-07', 'review_time': '00:59:00', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

This was my first experience with both, and will certainly be my last. The "Customer Service" I received from you , PayPal, was absolutely atrocious and you should be thoroughly embarrassed. Not only was I on hold for longer than 45 minutes, I had to go through 3 different people and had to repeat the same story all three times. At the end of that there still wasn\'t a resolution so I requested to speak to a manager, was put on hold again and eventually (after another 30 minutes of being on hold) had to hang up. This whole scenario has caused an additional $30 CAN to be added to my phone bill.\n\nI will never use your company again and will encourage others to do the same.\n\nSuck a giant bag of d*cks,\n\nEllie', 'review_date': '2020-01-06', 'review_time': '23:43:24', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
