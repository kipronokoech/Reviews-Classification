So I asked for a full refund, but was denied it.\n\nContacted Paypal and they were useless, and their terms and conditions favour the seller. They said they can get my full money back ($36 something) IF I SHIP THE ITEMS BACK TO CHINA. It would cost me around £50 (thats $75) to ship to China. So that was a ridiculous option. I spend twice the amount to get a refund??? How silly...!!! Unfortunately, I didn't share the sense of humour...!!!\n\nPaypal sent this notice via the dispute center, and I logged into complain about the option, BUT there was no place to leave comments. ONLY option was to provide tracking details. I tried calling paypal and was on the phone for 50mins, with no answer. Dropped them a detailed email, NO contact back for a week.

When we first signed up, we immediately noticed an increase in orders with a status of "Not Completed". Customers using Master Card, always received a message saying that data was missing, making it appear as if the orders were not completed. I would run their cards using LinkPoint and they would work fine. It took PayPal 6 months to figure it out and get Master Cards to process. The problem was that a Master card TOS was not accepted (We were never asked to accept it). The error message was so misleading, that no one at PayPal could figure out the real problem for months.\n\nAfter going through that, I asked Adam, who traced it down to make sure that they changed their error message to indicate the problem and not use one that indicated something other then the problem. I thought they surely would correct this since displaying an error is relatively easy. The trouble was we were still getting a high amount of orders with the same status of "Not Completed". I contacted several customers, and this was happening with both Master Card and Visa, about 10% of the time. Some customers put their order in 4, 5 or even 6 times. Some left to shop elsewhere, since they thought our system had a problem.\n\nUsing the PayPal Pro Manager, I noticed that when a customer put in several "Not Completed" orders, the status from the bank came came back as "12", meaning the card was declined. Believe it or not, the customers were still getting the message saying that Data was Missing and they should supply the missing data below. Naturally there was no data below, since this was NOT and had never been the problem. The message should have said "Your Credit Card was Declined by Your Bank". How hard can that be?\n\nI do not know if PayPal cannot afford good programmers, or if the support team just cannot figure out that this is bug that is hurting our customers and costing us sales, but nothing has been done. We get those standard emails that everyone is upset about. The ones that you cannot reply to, saying they thank us for our suggestion.\n\nHow can PayPal customers every hope to get their issues really abated, when the support team just does not seem capable of telling the difference between a bug and a suggestion? How are we supposed to believe that PayPal cares, when they will NOT care enough to fix an easy to fix bug? Meanwhile, we are loosing business.

The first time PayPal did not transfer my funds apparently my account have been overdraft due to it'Is fees and they told me they would resend my money again. To my surprise they never did. Yes they kept the money. I would call that stealing but that's too irrational for the company so ill call it keeping. 2. My account got frozen when I try adding money to do a return. I was ask to give my social security information my birthday certificate among other important documents.Why should I give my important documents to a company who isn't federal protected. I ignore it and then got a screen pop up to submit my information which I have not and will not do. I had to literally do a money order to give a refund to my costumer because I couldn't use PayPal 3. PayPal states no fees well I beg the differ there's hidden fees everywhere. I get ACH windraws from my bank account here and there almost $50 dollars of Withdraws from them that added to eBay fees is like all my earnings like they are using my stuff in other words to make money out of me and kept it. They say it takes 3-4 days to transfer money that's a big no and it shouldn't take that long they take less to take away from me they sure do want their share fast but take 3-4 days to do a simple transfer it's illegal to use peoples money and holding it and they make money out of that plus fees and withdrawing from my bank account. I get calls from PayPal to pay $6 six when they had taken away a lot more from me. I hear a lady in the background laughing what kind of joke is this. This company is a joke a disgrace to people who are trying to make that extra money to pay bills. They freeze accounts keep the money and it's ok for them to do that. I only wish that people who want to use PayPal dont give them your personal information dont trust their so called costumer service.Make sure if you're printing labels from there and eBay to print them in less than 24 hours they don't let you reprint after 24 hours I had to pay multiple shipping labels.

For finish the account-check they asked for several information that according German and European law (Customer privacy/Datenschutz) we were not able to supply them to third person or company.\n\nWe have sent just information to paypal which are not against “customer privacy” and our AGB, but the following requested info. by paypal has not been sent to them:\n\nThey had written in the mail “until we receive following documents you can only receive money by your paypal account…”\n“Bis wir die folgenden Unterlagen von Ihnen bekommen und geprüft haben, können Sie Ihr PayPal-Konto nur eingeschränkt nutzen:“\n\nA- Kontaktinformationen Ihres Lieferanten und Rechnungen von Ihrem Liferanten von Oktober-Dezember 2014 (Contact information of your suppliers and invoices from October-December 2014!)\n\nB- Lieferscheine (Deliver notes!)\n\nC- Bitte erklären Sie uns Ihr Geschäftsmodell.

To supply them to third company or person is directly acting against “Customer Privacy (Datenschutz)”. It’s also against our own “terms and Conditions (AGB)”.

Provide these documents is also acting against “Customer Privacy”!\n\n2- It Includes privet info of employees, their salary and information of all other people/companies who has paid/received payment to/from us in last 3 months. Again acting against “Customer privacy” and several other European/German laws.\n\n******\n\nFinally until Dec. 30th we had several contacts with Paypal by phone and per E-mail and we tried to explain them what they are doing. They did not wanted to solve the problem and they did not explain any reason for the problem. Bellow is some of their “Funny “ Answers:\n\n1- What is the reason of this problem? “ it’s a normal process we have in our company. Time to time we check different (companies) accounts! We don´t say you have done anything wrong, but some companies have done!!!\n\n2- You are asking for information/documents which is against “customers privacy” law? “But we have also “customer privacy” and we will not forward these information to third party!!!” I understand this answer as: “ You may act against the law, but don´t worry, we will not inform your customers or other organizations (like court) that you have forwarded these information.”\n\n3- Are you collection and/or copy business concepts/information? “No, this is a normal process and we HAVE asked MANY COMPANIES for these information! Normally companies have not any problem to supply these information, why your company has problem with that…?”\nDose this answer mean; already in several or many cases Paypal has been involved or forced companies to acting against “Customer Privacy” law?\n\n4- Why you need our bank account print for last 3 months? “ We just want to verify bank account linked to the Paypal account (is it your company bank account)”!!! It’s not correct answer, because; First the bank account has been verified in past by Paypal. Second, to verify this point one more time, paypal needs just statement from bank. (The bank account linked to Paypal is our official bank account in Deutschebank which is also shown in our website)\n\n******\n\nEven we informed paypal that to supply these information is acting against “Customer Privacy”, they answered again per E-Mail on Dec. 29th : Until they receive the document and confirm them, we cannot use our funds in our Paypal account!; “Bis wir die folgenden Unterlagen von Ihnen bekommen und geprüft haben, können Sie Ihr PayPal-Konto nur eingeschränkt nutzen”!!!\n\nUntil 30-12-2014 (our last working day in 2014) they did not explained what has been done wrong by our company to froze our funds.\n\nIn the same day after our closing time (6;00PM) they sent an E-mail and informed us that all our funds in Paypal is frozen for 45days; “100% Ihrer täglich eingehenden Zahlungen werden für jeweils 45 Tage einbehalten. “ and they have done it according the point 10.4 of their terms and condition! The point 10.4 in German version allow them to keep your amount for period of time and extend it (in case they want), Under English version of terms and conditionspoint 10.4 does not existing, but you find something like the German version under point 11.4.\n\nThis point 10.4/11.4 can be very dangerous for companies and can be used anytime from paypal side without any reason (or if there is a reason they don´t need to tell you that) against companies using Paypal. In this point is not also clear the maximum time that they may froze the money. in English version is mentioned 30 days, but can be extended… (How long?)\n\n\nIf your company accept paypal and you have for example over 50% of the turnover by paypal, in first month you miss over 50% of your cash-flow, in month after 50% more, means during 2 months you will lose 100% cash-flow in your company. In case that you make much more than 50% monthly turnover by paypal, you will lose the cash-flow much faster. The worst is that you cannot do anything in this situation!\n\n*****\n\nIs really Paypal close to bankrupt?\n\nIn one hand over 15 days Paypal is not able to Transfer our money to our bank account and it has been extended for 45 days. I have seen now several other posts on internet with same problem with Paypal.\n\nIn other hand I saw in ZDnet that Ebay/Paypal dismiss 3000 employees in beginning of 2015.\n\nBased on these two facts we believe Paypal/ebay is trying to cover their problems with other companies money…\n\n\n*****\n\nSome more info:\n\nTo make it more transparent I need to add:\n*Our company sell physical products. We ship exclusively from our stock in Germany within 1-2 working days.\n*In this moment the frozen amount is over 12000€ + 5000-8000€ amount of new orders.\n*We have had totally 5 customers conflict and all of them has been solved. The only last one has been conflict for 22.85€, which was also solved from our side and in this moment we have not any conflict with any customer.\nFinally the problem is not based on any conflict between customers and our company. Its only based on, “Paypal wants to keep the money in their side!”\n\n*****\n\nRead one more time Paypal terms and conditions specially the point below:\n\nPoint 10.4/11.4 of Paypal Terms and conditions:\n\n11.4 Actions by PayPal - Holds.\n\nRisk-Based Holds. PayPal, in its sole discretion, may place a hold on any or all of the payments you receive when PayPal believes there may be a high level of risk associated with you, your Account, or any or all of your transactions. PayPal’s determination may be based on different factors and PayPal may rely on information it receives from third parties such as eBay. If PayPal places a hold on a payment, the funds will appear in your “pending balance” and the payment status will indicate the hold, for example it can show as “Completed - Funds not yet available.” If PayPal places a hold on any or all of the payments you receive, PayPal will provide you with notice of our actions. PayPal will release the hold on any payment after 30 Days from the date the payment was received into your Account unless PayPal has a reason to continue to hold the payment such as (a) the receipt of a Dispute, Claim, Chargeback, or Reversal, (b) PayPal believes that you have violated the terms of this Agreement or any other Policy and that such a violation results in the need to continue holding the funds, or (c) PayPal believes that you may be engaging in potentially fraudulent or suspicious activity and/or transactions. In such an event, PayPal may continue holding the payment in your Account until the matter is resolved pursuant to this Agreement. PayPal, in its sole discretion, may release the hold earlier under certain circumstances, for example when you upload tracking information of the item you shipped.\nDisputed Transaction Holds. If a User files a Dispute, Claim, Chargeback or Reversal on a payment you received, PayPal may place a temporary hold on the funds in your Account to cover the amount of the liability. If you win the dispute or the transaction is eligible for PayPal Seller Protection, PayPal will lift the temporary hold. If you lose the dispute, PayPal will remove the funds from your Account. This process also applies to claims that a buyer files directly with eBay through the eBay resolution process.\n\n\n10.4 Reserven.\n\nPayPal kann aus Ihrem Guthaben auf Ihrem PayPal-Konto eine Reserve bilden.\n\nDas geschieht dann, wenn wir aufgrund uns zur Verfügung stehender Informationen berechtigterweise zu der Einschätzung kommen, dass im Zusammenhang mit Ihrem PayPal-Konto aufgrund Ihrer finanziellen Situation und aufgrund der in Ziffer 10.5(a) genannten Kriterien ein erhöhtes Risiko für uns besteht, einschließlich eines Ausfallrisikos gemäß Ziffer 10.1.\n\nDas bedeutet: Ein bestimmter Teil Ihres Guthabens oder Ihrer eingehenden Zahlungen wird auf Ihr Reservekonto gebucht und erscheint als "nicht verfügbar" in Ihrer Kontoübersicht. Über dieses Guthaben können Sie nicht unmittelbar verfügen.\n\nWenn wir eine Reserve bilden, teilen wir Ihnen die genauen Bedingungen dafür mit. Die Bedingungen können zum Beispiel so aussehen:\n\nWir behalten als Reserve einen bestimmten Prozentsatz der empfangenen Zahlungen über einen bestimmten Zeitraum ein ("dynamische Reserve").\nWir behalten einen Fixbetrag in Ihrem Konto ein ("Mindestreserve").\nDie Bedingungen richten sich danach, was wir für notwendig erachten, um die mit Ihrem PayPal-Konto verbundenen Risiken zu minimieren. Wir können die Bedingungen ändern, sofern wir Ihnen die Änderungen mitteilen. Wenn Sie mit der Bildung einer Reserve nicht einverstanden sind, können Sie Ihr PayPal-Konto schließen. Wenn Ihr PayPal-Konto, gleich aus welchem Grund, geschlossen wird, können wir gemäß Ziffer 7.2 eine Reserve nicht länger als nötig einbehalten.\n\nAls Teil unseres Risikomanagements können wir auch folgende Maßnahmen für Abbuchungen von Geld auf Ihr Bankkonto ergreifen:\n\nDen Betrag begrenzen, den Sie von Ihrem PayPal-Konto unmittelbar abheben können.\nDie Auszahlungsgeschwindigkeit oder Auszahlungsform ändern.\nEine Aufrechnung mit Ihrem Guthaben vornehmen und/oder Sie oder eine mit Ihnen verbundene Person dazu auffordern, Vereinbarungen mit uns über Sicherheiten zu treffen (zum Beispiel eine Garantie abzugeben oder Sicherheiten für Ihre Verbindlichkeiten bei uns oder Dritten zu hinterlegen). Sie sind verpflichtet, die dazu gegebenenfalls notwendigen Schritte und Maßnahmen auf Ihre Kosten zu ergreifen, um die Bildung einer Reserve oder einer anderen Sicherheit zu unseren Gunsten rechtswirksam zu ermöglichen.\n\n\nIf you have experienced same situation, please leave comments and if possible a way to contact you.', 'review_date': '2015-01-02', 'review_time': '23:14:29', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
