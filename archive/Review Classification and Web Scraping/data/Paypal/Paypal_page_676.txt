Received text if service code initiatedby OayPal to my 5-6 month old "new" phone number.

The rep said no "charges" had been posted to my account. However, that did not mean no future or pending charges could be posted. Again, I requested that they block the individual who was using my phone number fraudulently so very was protected. 5-6 separate times they said they would have to verify information for security reasons and I gave permission to do so, twice. Frustrated at the lack of service and "scripted" responses I requested to speak to a supervisor. The representative disconnected the phone call. Intentionally? Probably but I did not receive a call back to connect next to someone capable of resolving a simple problem.', 'review_date': '2019-12-17', 'review_time': '17:45:23', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
