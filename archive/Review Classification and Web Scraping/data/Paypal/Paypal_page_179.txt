Room was completely different than what was shown, a lot smaller than the size mentioned (172 ft sq) and lots of items were missing from description but the most important was the fan (provided that tehre was no air conditioning, and tempratures were 32+). they also asked me for a tax in cash whereas booking.com said all taxes are paid. The receptionists also told me that the pictures on booking.com are fake. i first contacted booking.com who refused to refund, and then Paypal who refused with a template message that item is neither damaged, nor any part is missing, and description states "item is materially similar to seller\'r description". I wonder if i was booking a hotel or bought some material item :)\n\nit turns out paypal only refund for small businesses and individuals, but when it comes to bigger businesses, they dont even bother to read your claim.. i sent them pictures of the room given, the room promised, missing items, extra tax costs, and also booking.com response where they suggested to leave a negative review but forget about money refund.. i provided all of them but Paypal did not even consider any of them..\n\nhaving said that... i have been using paypal fo over 10 years.. and never disputed even once... first time i used it for hotel booking and disputed and got this treatment.. now its good to say.. bye bye Paypal... you dont deserve loyal customers. and shame on your dispute resolution team who favours bigger businesses only.', 'review_date': '2022-07-27', 'review_time': '19:57:53', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
