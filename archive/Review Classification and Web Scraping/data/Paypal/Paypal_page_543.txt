Notifying them that the company Beyondking I have purchased clothing from in mid-April is fraudulent. I have also indicated to Paypal that I have requested order cancelation multiple times and the company suggested in broken English that I could regift their fake product.\n\nI have written to PayPal that the company (Beyondking) uses stolen pics from other designers and not uncommonly does not even send anything to the customer. I have attached multiple webpages (including those on Trustpilot) of complaints from other customers about Beyondking to demonstrate to PayPal that the issue I am dealing with has happened to many others.\nAfter 3.5 months from the order time and contacting PayPal and writing in great detail about the issues, I have received a shipment of synthetic products (instead of cotton) that do not look like anything on the website. I mean literally not even attempting to have the same colors, design, ornaments, patterns. This is despite my request of canceling the order and notifying PayPal months and months ago. Paypal has chosen to work with the fraudulent companies and keep postponing my case resolution until I have finally received as I predicted 3.5 months ago GARBAGE.\n\nUnfortunately, PayPal has chosen to become a part of a bait-and-switch scam despite multiple customers reporting to PayPal about issues with Beyondking.\n\nOn top of that shameless PayPal has no functioning customer service. In the past 3.5 months, I have not been able to chat or speak with the real person.\n\nI am not the only customer who has been abused by PayPal and given the runaround without any resolution or even attempt at a resolution after becoming a victim of bait-and-switch schemes supported by PayPal.\n\nIn fact, when I reported the abuse (aka no customer service) on PayPal's Facebook page they simply blocked me and deleted my comments.", 'review_date': '2020-08-13', 'review_time': '17:11:15', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
