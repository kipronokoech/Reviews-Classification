In my most recent experience with PayPal, I asked for their help due to a vendor shorting my order (paid for 4 but only received 2 of them). When the vendor would not respond or acknowledge my issue, I contacted PayPal for some resolution. PayPal did not resolve the issue after having me wait over a month. Then, they just denied the claim with no assistance. I appealed the decision and wrote a couple of letters to explain the issue, but they denied the appeal after a couple of weeks. My advice is to use your credit card company (I have always had good results) and do not use PayPal. They will not protect the buyers as they advertise.', 'review_date': '2019-06-28', 'review_time': '11:57:56', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

Started to take 5-10% of the payment, BEFORE the money is even in my account without telling me - then making me wait 14 days for the reduced payment, in the mean time Ebay invoice you and take another 10% of the TOTAL sale, before arriving in your bank - which if you dont pay, your accounts get closed.\nBeen selling for years and this consistently happens, paypal say every time this happens they don't know why the funds keep getting withheld but they cant do anything about it - so paypal don't even know how paypal operate; geniuses. Any issues with people scamming you as a buyer or seller, Ebay takes a minimum of 8 weeks to look into the case, and when they finally do, it's like they pick out of a hat who wins the case because they don't know their as* from their elbow & that much time has elapsed they cant be arsed scrolling through the dispute. All foreign support reading off cue cards, can't speak a word of the queens. Management know less than the cue-card readers so that route is futile.\n\nCant believe these have the monopoly on these sorts of Internet transactions.\n\nThey are a partner and the same company as eBay, but they aren't at the same time - it's when it suits either company whether they decide they are the same company or not. This gives them scope to fob you off whenever they feel like it, they can blame one or the other, and you often get them arguing between themselves about where issues lie.\n\nDefinitely a company going to pot.
