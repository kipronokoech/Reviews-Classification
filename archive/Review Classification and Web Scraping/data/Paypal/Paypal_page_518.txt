You're better off sending money via the mail because it's probably faster and more reliable. i trust the local drunks more than paypal.\n\nIf you want my honest opinion paypal should just close up shop because once a shitshow always a shitshow.\n\nBefore you think i'm being bias or just rude, I am fully aware of the hurdles and laws they must jump through in order to get you your money but taking 21 days to do so is beyond a joke then when you ask why they give you stupid repetitive and wrong answers with conflicting data. For example I had recieved a payment on a banner i had created for a client. Both parties happy payment made customer marked as delivered all good. Paypal told me 4 times to supply a tracking number for a VIRTUAL ITEM and told me if i don't i will recieve the money within 21 days. Then it was 4 days, then 7 then 14 then 21 again!\n\nEven a basic refund on ebay took 9 days and funny thing is i'm still waiting for it. The seller confirmed they sent the money *Not via Echeque* with proof yet paypal are adament they sent it via Echeque.\n\nYou are likely to recieve better customer service from a toddler.
