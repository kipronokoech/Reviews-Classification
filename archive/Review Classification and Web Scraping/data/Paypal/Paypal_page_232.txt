Well since November have been under this unbelievable pressure for ME to produce bank account, tracking numbers,Aust Post information confirming delivery to them virtually everything but hand deliver it to them and they come back and say the COmpany does not have to pay back money that does not belong to them. What planet are you living on Paypal you are as bad as the mob of shisters in N.S.W. What company gets to keep money paid for 5 tops and also get back the 5 circus tents they send. My advice steer clear of Companies that do not reinburse money ( that"s stealing) and Paypal thank you for nothing. There was virtually nothing more I could have done to prove i deserved my money back. Paypal reckon I did not prove i paid. Check you own statement page you clowns there it is in big print amount paid, who to, what date, transaction details all there for you to see (which I pointed out more than once) how many companies send out order without prior payment. But them I suppose any excuse Paypal is better tnan none. I hope you get a company one day that stabs you in the back. But I suppose the percentage you get from sellers is enough to soothe your consence. Shame on you.

They ask you to repeat the most fundamental information and then do nothing at all. Then, when they finally do escalate an issue, the next tier takes the most illogical, nonsensical action imaginable and completely stuffs things up.\n\nPayPal’s final act of self-harm was to then arbitrarily close the account, with no warning, no recourse and no communication. When I was lucky enough to get through to a representative in the Republic of Ireland he was, frankly, hostile. Said that “they” (presumably some decision-making team or the other in God knows what corner of the world) were adamant they wanted the account gone due to “high-risk behaviour”. When I asked what was so risky about changing the legal name of a business, I wasn’t given anything like an actual answer.\n\nLike so many tech giants, this company clearly thinks it is some sort of cross between a head of state and a court of law but with no separation of powers, accountability or right for “the accused” to defend themselves.\n\nPayPal’s attitude is despicable.
