The stupid questionire thing for security supposedly linked to my credit file asked my previous name and all of the answers were female names and I’ve never changed my name!!!

I sold a pair of trainers on ebay, in my listing I provided many pictures and information and it was clearly stated that I don't accept returns. I even spent money and time to travel to a post office which was opened so I could post the trainers in time. I wanted to be nice and provide a good experience for the buyer.\nSoon buyer sent me a message that the trainers were too big and wanted to return them. I politely refused it and suggested to ask some friends if they wanted the shoes. Buyer started to beg and became hysterical, then she requested a refund through ebay. I refused it. Then she opened a case against me on paypal with the reason: item not as described. The trainers are size 5 and it was stated in listing name, in details, in description and on pictures (the shoe label even said how many cm the length was). I provided these informations to paypal. Very soon I received their decision: I had to issue a refund. ?????? why? becasue seller bought something without knowing if it will fit or no? this is ebay, it happens, it happened to me as well as buyer and i didnt start to beg or dispute a false claim. Anyway the shoes were sent back, paypal fee is not refunded obviously and now I am at that point when i dont want to use paypal anymore. Im going find another way to sell my staff.\nShame on paypal.", 'review_date': '2018-12-05', 'review_time': '13:05:16', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

I did not realize at the time that the bank account associated with my PayPal account was an old account that had already been closed. Rather than PayPal not letting the transactions go through, they allowed both to go through, only days later letting me know the bank had denied the transactions. I did not have enough time to go correct the payment information and instead was notified that the my bank had filed two claims against me that only they, and not PayPal, could close. The funds were frozen from the seller. After calling PayPal regarding the issue, they notified me that only my bank could cancel the claims, and that no one on PayPal's end could do so. I called my bank several times attempting to locate who/why this claim was filed by them, they explained that they have absolutely no record on their end of these claims being filed. AFTER 15 CALLS, WITH 15 DIFFERENT REPRESENTATIVES, explaining THE SAME EXACT ISSUE over and over again because they were not keeping record of previous calls, and after 15 TIMES of having to repeat myself that my bank has no record of filling these claims, I was finally redirected to the fraud department at PayPal where the representative told me she would cancel the claims. Little did I know at the time that she would only cancel one claim and keep the second one open. So for the next 12 hours I went through the same process again. The hours that I have spent on hold are painful to think about.\n\nI am so incredibly disappointed in this company. I have NEVER in my life written a review but this time I simply could not stop myself. Throughout this entire process I was in contact with a bank (5/3rd Bank) that I have not had an account with for over 2 years and their customer support helped me as if I was one of their loyal customers. I had two 5/3rd Bank representatives participate in 3 way calls with me and PayPal just to reiterate the fact that they did not file any claims against me in PayPal.\n\nThis experience was so terrible that I will be making an avid point to avoid PayPal at all costs. I NEVER again want to deal with their customer service. I am exhausted and simply have no more words regarding this experience.", 'review_date': '2018-12-05', 'review_time': '02:35:36', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
