We contacted PayPal and asked for partial refund or return shipping label. Every single time the representative gives a different reply. The first time they said we will send email to seller and we will call you back. When we did not receive the call we called again and then the person at PayPal says no that is wrong we can never call back our customer it was wrong information given to me earlier. He says I am sending email to seller now and if they dont reply within 3 days the case will be in your favor and you will get full refund back. We did not get any response in 5 days so we call again and this time they again say we were informed wrong we can never give away the case in your favor with a full refund and we are sending email again to seller.

I was actually in bed at the time because I was feeling too tired from uni training to celebrate. The next morning I received a 'Thank you for your order' email from ebay and nearly £40 marked as pending from my bank account! I rang them and they blamed Paypal for allowing the hacker to use the Paypal link in my ebay account to order this item. I was assured by both companies that the transaction was stopped and Paypal were opening an investigation. Meanwhile, several days later, Paypal stole the £40 from my bank account and are taking their time to return it whilst they continue with their 'investigation'! Ebay are useless too, stating that they can't do anything because Paypal are doing the investigation, so they've lost my business, especially as this hacker continually tries to place Smartphones into my basket...but the last adviser did actually tell me the address of this person....218 Harrington Street Derbyshire DE23 8NY using my name!?! I live in Wales! I closed my ebay account which will take 7 days, whilst this piece of grit continues to place items into my basket. The local policeman who rang me after I reported this attempt at fraud said it was probably somebody logged into my account by accident, but they would still have had to enter their address manually, so I don't accept his reasoning and won't be rushing to recommend him as a 'Columbo' and overdue a promotion! The whole saga is frustrating. Paypal take ages to answer, keep me hanging on for ages whilst they transfer me and I keep getting fobbed off with their staff stating there's a huge backlog for their investigation team to get through. This DOESN'T inspire confidence in me because it suggests loads of other folk are having problems too, so once I get my money back, I'll be closing my account with Paypal also.
