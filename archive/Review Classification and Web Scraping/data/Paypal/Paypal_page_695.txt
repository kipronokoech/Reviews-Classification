After a week of no emails nor tracking number I emailed this website and got no reply after two days. So I used the email provide by Paypal with again no reply. Looking at their wedsite under shipping said "How long will it take for the buyer to receive their order?\nOn average, merchandise is produced and shipped from our facility 2-3 business days after purchase. Standard shipping/transit times apply (5-10 days for domestic and 7-15 days for international)." Knowing this I thought I should have got the item by now so I used goggle maps and the address provided by this website and found something odd. Goggle maps showed a different company. This different company website had a phone number so I called and talked to a woman who ran the accounts there and told her the problem. To my surprise she had told me she had other phone calls about the same problem that they told this seller from the website I ordered from to change his address that it wasn\'t his bussness. Hearing this I knew this was a scam and was using this other company\'s address as a front, so filed with the FBI, FTC, and Paypal. After which I get a email from someone named differently than the seller I dealt with and with a different website saying my order was shipped out of CHINA. Looking at this new website I found that this address was a residential area on goggle maps. Telling Paypal this was a waste of time as I had to wait to get the item which came from CHINA. Oct 29 2019 I received the item and wasn\'t even close to what I ordered, so again I called Paypal and told them about it and even told them I recorded me opening it. They told me I had to wait another 10 days to have the seller respond. Oct 30th 2019 I get an email from Paypal saying I have to send the item back to the seller only this time it wasn\'t the China address they gave me, it was Vietnam. So after doing a little research with the Vietnam address I called Paypal back and told the rep "you do know this address points to a restaurant? Don\'t take my word for it, Google it." So she did and gets back on there saying "Your right, but that\'s the seller\'s email and address he gave us so ship it there." I then asked her about the shipping cost which she replied that Paypal will refund shipping cost up to $30.00.\nOct. 31st 2019: I took the package to the post office and not only did I have to sit there and fill out a customs form but it cost me $38.75 to ship it. Nov. 1st 2019, Just received a email from Paypal that they are paying me $30.00 of the shipping which means I\'m out of $8.75 that I won\'t get to see. So now I have to wait til this seller gets the item and found out what my next hoop is that I have to jump through.\nNov. 6th 2019: I noticed that Paypal changed the Estimated case resolution from the 8th to the 11th.', 'review_date': '2019-11-07', 'review_time': '13:45:08', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

However, I have tried to contact PayPal using the chat and email but only get automated/generic responses.\n\nTheir responses to emails are automated and are not actually read. Because if they did read the email the rep would know that the automated response was not answering my question. The chat does the same thing, provides responses based on key words. When you ask for a "live" agent it stated that no agents are available.\n\nThen when you try to email, chat or submit an inquiry via the resolution center they limit you to these boxed-in categories that you must choose regarding your issue. Therefore, if your issue is not within those categories you just have to pick one just to submit the inquiry. The resolution team then sends you back a message saying that you\'re inquiry doesn\'t fit the category and close your case with no further follow up or a resolution. Customer service oriented...NOT.\n\nOverall the service provided by Paypal is fine. However, customer service lacks in that they should actual review/read the email inquiries and have a way to receive assistance from a live person other than having to call and sit on hold.\n\nWhen I finally got in contact with someone they claimed they couldn\'t help me with finding historical information on my account. After I had to let them know my inquiry included someone else\'s information being on my account, then they became very forthcoming and then all of a sudden had access to the information. This was very disturbing and frustrating that the rep first said the information is not available. But when I make the rep aware of a possible mistake or fraud....all of a sudden you can find / have access to the information. So I felt like I was lied to.\n\nLater discovered that I was told the incorrect information when I inquired regarding a fee related to one of my transactions. So I had to call back the next day. After sitting on hold for 45 minutes, I spoke with Christian who was very rude, curt and unaccommodating. As the saying goes....it\'s not what you say, it\'s how you say it.\n\nUtterly disappointed!!! I will be seeking other options and companies for this type of service.
