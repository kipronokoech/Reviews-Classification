PayPal used to be an awesome company with amazing customer service and now it\'s like they don\'t give a F.\n\nI know tech has its issues, so I\'m not easy to judge companies for a mishap. I went into a gas station to get gas and it kept declining my card. I checked PayPal on the app and lots of money there, so I ask the guy to run it 4 more times, all declined. i get on the phone with PayPal just for them to tell me "sir we see you have money but there\'s something going on with your card." So I asked them if they can fix it (I\'m paraphrasing but I was nice and I was just wanting the problem resolved). But when that 1st guy was like, "we\'ll SEE if we can help you," my mind blew up like, "YOU BETTA HELP ME, YOU GOT MY MONEY!!!!"\n\nI can\'t even anymore. PayPal could literally CARE LESS about it\'s customers. Seriously. Please don\'t give this company your money. I know you still will, but just had to say that :) We (Humanity) deserve better. I\'m so serious. PLEASE STOP USING PAYPAL! They care not how their negligence affects their customers. PayPal went from HIGH CLASS when they first started out years and years ago to NO CLASS!\n\nThey also obviously have deep pockets to pay reviewers from publications to give them AMAZING reviews. However, when you look at consumer reviews it\'s all the same. PayPal Sucks.\n\nJust let them go out of business. It\'s obvious they don\'t care and when this scam is up it\'ll free time up for them to figure out their next Fyre Festival or Theranos play!\n\nThanks for all the help PayPal Employee ROSS #40406', 'review_date': '2019-03-19', 'review_time': '02:38:51', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
