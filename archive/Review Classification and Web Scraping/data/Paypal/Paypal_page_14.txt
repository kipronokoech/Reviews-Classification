To say it's technologically temperamental would be an understatement.\n\nFirstly, setting up an additional user for my business account was a difficult task. It took me three attempts to get it right because the log-in kept expiring or link in the email for the user simply not working.\n\nSecondly, the additional security measures are more of a hindrance than a help. Randomly, after multiple successful log ins, paypal decided that a phone number was required for extra security and that I should contact my account administrator.\n\nMoreover, the log-in page misleadingly states that you can log in using an email or phone number. In reality, you need a username to log in for business. This inconsistency is not just confusing; it's poor design.\n\nLastly, customer support options are severely limited. For a service that handles something as sensitive as money, I expected better.\n\nOverall, I'm incredibly disappointed with PayPal's business account services. They need to seriously reconsider their user interface and customer service if they want to remain a viable option for business users.", 'review_date': '2023-10-02', 'review_time': '12:08:56', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

I cancelled a few pre approved payments as they call them, mostly for small amounts and never received a confirmation email. The payments were cancelled though so no issue until it cam to a larger payment which was also cancelled. They paid it and when I spoke with them they said did you get an email. I explained i cancelled almost a year ago so I have no idea. Apparently paypal put themselves with the Gods in terms of you should keep emails from a year ago from them even though they did not send them. I then got through to a supervisor with a clear made up name in a call centre with so much background noise going on that the supervisor did not realise they had not put me on hold when apparently going to speak to their manager. When the supervisor eventually came back on to the call having claimed to have spoken with the manager they gave me a complete load of you know what in an explanation. Obviously they had not spoken with the manager as I could hear their entire call that is unless their on hold music is sounds of a s dodgy call centre. I asked them to clarify that they had spoken with a supervisor/manager and asked their name but they could not give it to me..... Probably because they had not spoken to someone. Anyway, idiotically long story short Paypal have awful systems that do not speak to each other and its basically hit and moss if they actually work or not. Their customer service is a mass call centre based in a country with a space program and to be fair great food but seems to be full of people who just cannot tell the truth. Avoid Paypal is my advice and please look at so many bad experiences on their reviews.', 'review_date': '2023-10-02', 'review_time': '10:42:36', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

However, my recent experiences have prompted significant concerns, particularly regarding customer service and app ratings.\n\nDespite its popularity, I've found PayPal’s customer service to be astonishingly inadequate. In my attempts to resolve an issue, I encountered not only difficulty in reaching representatives but also encountered staff who were unable to assist when finally contacted. This has been not only inconvenient but also troubling, considering the financial nature of the service.\n\nFurthermore, while the PayPal app boasts numerous positive reviews, a critical examination reveals a puzzling uniformity in content across them. This has led me to suspect the possibility of artificial enhancement of their rating through potentially fake reviews. Such a practice, if true, is disheartening for users genuinely searching for a reliable financial platform.\n\nIn an era where digital transactions are crucial, reliability and authentic customer support are paramount. I sincerely hope that my review might serve as a catalyst for PayPal to critically assess and improve upon these areas.", 'review_date': '2023-10-02', 'review_time': '07:01:57', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

As you can see from our online presence, "OrnamentallyYou" enjoys a stellar reputation, with an impressive 4.8/4.9 rating. Most of our customer reviews highlight our lightning-fast shipping, outstanding product quality, and top-notch customer service.\n\nIt\'s genuinely perplexing why PayPal insists on holding our funds, effectively compelling our company to seek expensive business loans to maintain our operations. It\'s evident that we operate as a seasonal business, and our growth is undeniable. However, our greatest obstacle has become PayPal itself. The situation is disheartening, especially considering how much small businesses like ours rely on financial stability.\n\nThe question that arises is, if PayPal chooses to withhold our funds without a valid reason, why not offer some form of interest? Why should we, as a small business, bear the brunt of this financial strain while PayPal continues to profit from our hard-earned dollars? Our dedication to prompt service is evident, with items shipped out in less than 24 hours, making the situation all the more frustrating.\n\nIn conclusion, the challenges we face with PayPal\'s handling of our funds are disheartening.
