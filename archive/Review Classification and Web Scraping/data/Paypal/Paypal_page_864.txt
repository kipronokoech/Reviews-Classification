BEWARE!', 'message': "I was a paypal user since they first came about back in the late 1990's. Before they teamed up with eBay, they were a very good payment processing company, but I think they eventually just got greedy and power-trippy because they became the most horrible and terrible company I ever dealt with before.\n\nIn 2010, they placed a limit on my account although I had been in good standing for over a decade! They started asking all of these questions and requesting documents and information and then they would lift them limit, then replace it again and lift it and then place it again. The final time they placed it, they said it was permanent and they kept my money--hundreds of dollars--for 6 months!\n\nNEVER AGAIN! They are scam artists and they claim they can do whatever they want because you give them permission to when you sign up with them and agree to their terms and conditions. And with them dominating the market, it's hard to find alternatives--but they are out there. You just have to look.\n\nAnyway, I wouldn't recommend paypal to my worst enemy! They even had the nerve to block some of my debit cards from processing on the rare occasion that I bought some products on eBay and had to pay for those products thru PayPal!\n\nTheir policies are a complete joke--utterly ridiculous. They are the worst company ever. Don't trust them with your money! They will even automatically draft money out of your bank account and/or debit card if you link them to your PayPal account if they feel that you owe them money. And it takes 100 phone calls, 1000 headaches and forever to sort out issues and/or obtain valid refunds. More and more businesses are dropping them as payment processors as they find alternatives. and many businesses have also been ruined because of PayPal's shoddy policies.
