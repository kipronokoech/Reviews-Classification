I recently lost a case due to Paypal purposly prolonging the "case review" so the time line could fall out of visa\'s date range to dispute a claim. I had all proof and evidence the seller admitted the error. paypal purposly made me jump their hoops and follow their protcal to even shipping the product back to finally tell me my category item cannot be disputed. I advise anyone if you have a dispute you wish to escalate - go straight to your Visa/credit card and politely work with them and let them guide you how to dispute with your vendor and paypal.\n\nyour credit card has a time line they must have the escalation done by YOU, Paypal is considered the same as the vendor you buy your product with so treat them the same.\n\nI repeat escalate your dispute to your credit card as soon as you start your paypal dispute. your credit card is on your side so be nice to your credit card representative.', 'review_date': '2020-10-05', 'review_time': '20:41:13', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

They are very wide spread and many online retailers I shop at use paypal organically.\n\nPaypal is very restrictive in where you can use its card. For example you cannot use it for Onlyfans. It is my money why not?? Also I used it for a deposit on the annoying hotel incidental charge, which is a temporary hold.\n\nThe hotel said they release the hold on Sept 22nd, it is not Oct 5th and the hold is still pending! I called the hotel with a fury and they said it was Paypal's issue.\n\nI call Paypal and they said they will call back in 45 mins to 1 hour and a half!!! Are you kidding me?
