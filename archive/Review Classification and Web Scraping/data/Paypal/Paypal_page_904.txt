Because you are not dealing with tangible goods you can get scammed so easy. Paypal will not protect you if you are not dealing with an actual product and cannot provide proof of delivery. As a service based company, I have had 4 charge back claims in a year all due to Paypals lack of security and checking who's credit cards are being used. Here is how the scam works. I send an invoice for a service that I provide to an individual who hires me. They even have an confirmed Paypal account. This person then uses a friends credit card to pay for my transaction. I receive the payment showing that it came from the person that I billed it to however, I have no way of knowing which credit card was used. Now the friend who's credit card was used, calls their credit company and says they never authorized it. Paypal immediately reverses the charges because the credit card did not match the invoices name and address. Meanwhile they were the ones who accepted it!! When I called them they told me that there is nothing they can do about it and because it is a service...TOO BAD. I asked them why they did not check to make sure the name and addess matched the credit card and was told that they just don't. Here is the best, I was told by the Paypal customer service agent that perhaps I should stop accepting credit cards because they could not protect me. I should find another service provider who can!! Imagine that.\nI am currently dealing with a charge back from a person who did hire me and did use his own credit card but is disputing it because he did not receive the goods. His name is Humaid Sharif. Hired me 3 times and he has disputed all 3. Unfortunately I find out 4 month later so I could not stop providing the service to him. He is telling Paypal that he did not receive his goods so he is disputing it. How do you receive delivery on a service? You can't therefore he can easily dispute it. I forwarded to Paypal a copy of the invoice and power of attorney he signed hiring me and authorizing me to perform the service. I am waiting to see how they rule on this one. I will update this and let everyone know.\nOne of my charge backs was over $1,000.00 which hurts a small business like me.\nPlease do not use Paypal if you are a small business that provides a service. You too will get scammed. It is better to go with a credit card company where you can actually receive the credit card number and key in the name and address yourself so you can make sure a fraudulent card is not being used. On top of all that, they charge a ridiculous charge back on their own error. You would think a big company like that would make sure the name and address on the credit card actually matches the account holder.", 'review_date': '2013-04-12', 'review_time': '22:02:58', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

The VERY NEXT DAY my account was limited. They immediately associated my account with a PayPal account I had 2 years ago with a negative balance. Because of this, the business is now UNABLE to have their own PayPal account because their bank and card is attached to mine.\n\nAfter speaking with Liz who\'s PayPal Badge Number is 182899 she told me in a recorded conversation that there is NO-ONE at PayPal who would be willing to take action and remove the business information so they can have their own account. EVEN THOUGH their information was on my personal account. They would not let them take their own bank account and credit card off my account.\n\nIn Short, PayPal limited an account after it had been opened for over a year immediately after this business had their information attached to the account. They immediately found a reason to go after a person by taking advantage of a company. They could have limited this account any time within a 12 month period but they suddenly choose to limit it today? Needless to say, I paid my balance and removed the limitation but only because the company needed to have their bank and card back so they could create their own PayPal account.\n\nPayPal uses other people\'s money to their advantage, they can limit accounts on the fly, and they do what they want with their users. PayPal is an UNSAFE system for the Business Owner to utilize in the terms of they have Full Control, you do not*\n\nUnfortunately their are not that many alternatives to PayPal on the market today which PayPal uses to their advantage. They make interest on their account balances and they make a lot of money. It\'s like they\'re greedy enough to make others suffer. Bravo right, I say this is a poor business practice and the company needs to think about the way they do business with their users. I also think eBay needs to think about using another alternative to PayPal.\n\nIt\'s up to you what you want to use, but frankly I\'d rather work with a company that works with me like Payza, Escrow.com, and Moneybookers or Skrill. The fact that I take the time to review this experience should be enough for you to not use their selfish and greedy service.\n\nI was also told by Liz that I could get a copy of the call since "they record all their calls". Once I got to the right department, they said I needed to call their Legal number at 408-967-9915 and I\'d have to subpoena to get the call. My guess is they will destroy the evidence now and say no such call happened. God the whole company upsets me and what\'s hard is you can\'t get mad at their reps, they are just doing their job which the beast has trained them to do.\n\nI hope this helped some of you make the right decision.', 'review_date': '2013-04-09', 'review_time': '23:04:06', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

I thought that was safe.\n\nThe chinese person then claimed to have never have received the item. I called paypal with my tracking #, thinking I was good. I was informed it was not an acceptable tracking method. They refunded the chinese person\'s money, from my account. My account was $22 short, (about 25% of the total amount.) At this point, I have been robbed. I refuse to pay it.\n\nI google around. This is a common scam. Internationals learn that paypal doesn\'t accept USPS tracking #s and use this to scam US sellers.\n\nAnd paypal refuses to forgive the $22. Worse, they keep me on the phone for hours and hours (this wasn\'t my first call), dangling hope, transferring me from rep to rep, that they MIGHT forgive the $22.
