I\'ve called a total of 5 times in span of a month with no resolution. Im actually on hold for a supervisor and ive been on hold for 45 minutes!! With no agent checking back to see if i\'m still on hold.\nI purchased a beat online to make a song. After establishing with the producer he would send me the components of the beat. He only sent an mp3 of the beat with the contract. To me this means he didnt provide what he said he would. I even emailed the conversation with me and the producer and they still said the producer gave me what i paid for then said i onlu paid for the license of the beat! Unbelievable. And to top it off they sent my account to a collection agency to recover the money sent to the producer. They never sent me mail indicating i owed them any money. Worse case i will pay the collection agency which pay pal will only get a % back. This company is terrible DO NOT USE PAY PAL it is not worth losing your hard earned money for. Im still on hold and after an hour i will be hanging up. They place you on hold for so long so you hang up and nothing is done for you. I cant wait to close my account but i need to pay the collection agency now thank you pay pal for your incompetence well done.', 'review_date': '2021-07-15', 'review_time': '21:37:16', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
