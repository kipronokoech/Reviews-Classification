Maybe the merchant doesn't get your card number but with the banks refund process now who needs PayPal. If you need a refund on your bank card you wait up to 3 days for it to hit your bank. If you need a refund with PayPal they take the refunded payment which took 6 days to appear then you wait up to 10 working days for PayPal to refund it to your card! Thankfully it was only £32 but if it's a lot more and you need that money to buy something else you're stuffed. I called PayPal yesterday which was 30th May. The refund was 18th May and I was told I have to wait until next Monday another 6 days for the refund! Absolutely disgusting amount of time to wait fir a refund I'm furious and I'll never ever make another transaction with PayPal outside of eBay where you have no choice. My advice is don't use PayPal for any large transactions if you're dependant on the money and I wouldn't use them at all just stick with your bank card it's just as safe and a million miles quicker getting a refund.
