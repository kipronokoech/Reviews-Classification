That way if you do NOT receive your product it would be fully refunded. Well I had never received one order and it was delivered to the wrong address. But that was due to our wonderful Post Office in our area. I had filed a complaint and lost and figured it was no big deal since it was our postal service. But now I had alerted Pay Pay early since I found out that the company I purchased from was a scam! I tried multiple times to contact the seller since Pay Pal requires the buyer to communicate before making a case. I informed Pay Pal and sent proof of the issue and that the Vendor charged me more than was authorized. Well my LUCK the seller gave an old tracking number saying it was delivered and Pay Pal closed my case. They stated the vendor provided information showing it was delivered. Well guess WHAT Pay Pal. It was an old tracking number that had been used showing delivery over 120 Days ago. That’s FUNNY because it had only been 21 days since I had made the order. I took a screen shot showing UPS’s comment. It showed the delivery days of 120 Days or more and Pay Pal ignored me. Once a vendor provides any information it should be sent to the buyer to confirm, not just close the case because the vendor gave false information. Pay Pal will not even let you respond or dispute once they close the case. It seems the buyer protection plan is for the vendors, not the buyers!\nThanks a lot Pay Pal for your support.

Run the other way!!!', 'message': 'WARNING!\nDo not use paypal services to receive payments! They locked my account after receiving a few payments (perfectly legal business transaction, logged and traceable in our business´ bookkeeping). In order to release my account they requested a copy of drivers license, registration documents for my business and a copy of an invoice, which we uploaded instantly, receiving an automatic reply that it will be processed in 2-4 days. After a week I contacted customer support (CS), receiving non-answers and being asked to upload the documents over and over and over again. Their CS is completely useless – the only way to get in contact is to chat with someone who is just giving useless answers from a guide book, without any connection to your case at all. The phone number to the Swedish office is not monitored (I called 200-300 times without any answer). After weekly communication, through the CS chat, for a couple of months (!) we were asked to provide information about our business online, on their platform, which we did instantly. Unfortunately this platform is not functional and automatically deletes part of the information that was entered, which turned out to be a huge problem regarding legal names etc. CS did not get what the problem was and only provided basic and useless information out of the guide book. After communicating with CS 2-3 times per week for 6 months (!!!) we finally got a useful hint from the technical department to “request a senior agent” to manage our case. After we had done that, through the CS chat, the case was finally resolved. We were close to giving up though, since the whole situation was so frustrating and that there seemed to be no way to solve it. It took us about 80 working hours to communicate and upload documents. The chat transcript covers about 60 pages (!).\nAfter research online I believe that paypal have legal rights to close down any account, without any legal demand for a motivation, and then gain control of the funds, since they do not obey to international bank laws. To me paypal equals an unjust, dysfunctional and stinking business which targets small businesses and “the small man” in order to fatigue them with a useless CS and dysfunctional platform to finally gain control of their funds. None of these have resources enough, regarding either money or time, to take on a huge international business juridically, but someone definitely should! Thinking about using paypal?
