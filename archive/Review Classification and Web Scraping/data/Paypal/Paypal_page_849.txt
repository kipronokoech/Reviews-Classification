I was scammed using credit card alone, but after contacting bank and police, finally my money was returned. After that I started using PayPal and recommended it to everyone, stating it is the safest payment method. Well, that was until I got scammed by seller, this time using PayPal and found out that nothing I believed about PayPal was true. Let me say, I did nothing risky - already had business several times with this seller before, and everything was fine. But this time it wasn't.\nPayPal's customer support is a joke. Their help pages are out of date, giving you advices that cannot be followed. I asked questions in message center, they sent me automatic replies that did not help at all. I started dispute, they closed it in seller's favor without even giving me a chance to provide any evidence. I contacted customer support team, provided written evidence from seller that it was seller's mistake, but PayPal just didn't care. Each time other person replied my email with generic answer, not even bothering to read my email. After negative reviews about seller, the seller's partner pressed them to refund me my money, apologizing, stating it was their mistake and misunderstanding. They refunded me money and guess what - PayPal took provision on that, stating it is not a refund, because seller chose normal payment. Of course they chose normal, as PayPal closed dispute and transaction cannot be refunded anymore. But again - they just don't care.\n\nI was using PayPal without thinking, but now I am asking myself, why should I use PayPal again?\n1) My bank now has two factor authorization - more secure than PayPal\n2) My bank will protect me and contact police if I get scammed - PayPal will not care at all, they silently support scam\n3) My bank will not charge extra fees or have special conversion rates - PayPal does\n4) My bank has professional customer support team and they are located in the country I live - PayPal has arogant amateurs\n5) My bank cares to keep their customers, PayPal does not\n\nSo, judge for yourself, sooner or later you may be scammed too. In my case PayPal only wasted one month of my time, did nothing to protect me, and finally stole part of my refunded money.", 'review_date': '2017-05-24', 'review_time': '09:10:49', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

I have had to do all the chasing around and make endless calls to PayPal to try and sort it out. I had given them the crime reference number from actionfraud and tracking number of the package I was supposed to get and still they do not refund my money. They can clearly see I had been defrauded but would not issue refund as they demand to see the crime report document and will not accept the NF crime ref number. I would be more than happy to give them the crime document however I myself did not receive that from actionfraud. I have contacted action fraud numerous times for the document and they advised me that the document and password are for myself only and PayPal must accept the NFRC number as they can verfi its validity by checking online. I'm still trying to get my refund and I have threatened to take this up with the ombudsman if they do not issue it. I hope nobody else will need to go through the difficulty I'm going through at the moment.
