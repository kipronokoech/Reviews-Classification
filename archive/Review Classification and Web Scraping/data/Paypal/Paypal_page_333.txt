I have always heard “use PayPal they will get your money back”, what a joke. I ordered through a vendor 3/23 in the amount of $687.25. The vendor guarantees 7-10 day delivery. At the beginning of April I reached out to several customer serv. Reps for the company inquiring about my order and got ignored. By 4/17 I had requested a refund from the company and disputed the charges through PayPal. PayPal gave the vendor 3 weeks to respond and denied me a refund stating that the company showed proof of delivery. I informed them I hadn’t received anything and even provided reviews of others who had been through the same scam with this company. (Paid and got little to no product) Still denied. Out of money and no merchandise. I’m beyond annoyed I trusted this company.', 'review_date': '2021-05-17', 'review_time': '18:07:53', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
