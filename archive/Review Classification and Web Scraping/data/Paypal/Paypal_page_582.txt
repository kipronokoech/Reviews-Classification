I had to fight with them for 3 months to get them to return the money to my sister since i was being victimized by paypal for being a victim of fraud. over a year later and i cant purchase anything from ebay because ebay is owned by paypal and uses paypal to process all payments sneakily forcing you to sign up for a paypal account without even knowing it. and since my paypal accnt is locked i guess forever they wont process any payments from me. i have never dealt with such a shady company in my entire life. stay away from paypal and unfortunately ebay as well they are run by fraudsters who only support other fraudsters.', 'review_date': '2020-06-09', 'review_time': '05:41:20', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
