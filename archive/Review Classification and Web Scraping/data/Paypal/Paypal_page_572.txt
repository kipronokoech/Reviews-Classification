PayPal are by far the worst company I have ever had to deal with. They are not professional, or diligent. Their buyers protection scheme is completely flawed and does not live up to its word. They did not review mine or my families disputes properly which meant we have lost over £2000 of our money! They also didn’t have the manners to respond to two of my formal complaints which I logged a very long time ago. They won’t even update me on the status of my formal complaint because not one agent can supposedly access this system! Due to this, they have effectively allowed the seller (a rental company ran by Sylvie from Royal Elite Weeks in Mexico) to keep over £2000 of my family and I’s money. Shame on them for doing this during a difficult time. They allowed this to happen by denying my dispute (One being PP-D- 62890384 on the grounds that I had already received the service). No I did not which I explained to 12 agents on many occasions via the online messaging portal. I provided endless evidence, but each time it was just ignored and all I received were generic messages or lack of understanding! The odd agent did understand my case but stated that PayPal’s system was flawed so they could not put right the mistake which PayPal made without my consent when they changed my ‘case type’ from ‘item not received’ to ‘item not as described’. My claim was therefore never considered properly and I had to accept that I supposedly received my service when I didn’t. I truly believe that PayPal must be doing dodgy deals with sellers which is why I am taking this further. It is 100% clear that I did not receive the hotel service due to the hotel in Mexico (Sandos Caracol Eco Resort) being closed and still remains closed until 1st July. Furthermore, the whole country had been in lockdown so it is self explanatory. One of PayPal’s agents even outlined that my claim was denied because the seller does not offer ‘refunds! Just because her terms and conditions state that it doesn’t make it right or lawful. You can’t just keep someone’s money when they can’t offer the service that you paid for and I am in no position to travel now that my wedding is cancelled. It is so wrong. PayPal were in a position to make this situation right but they failed to support their customer in a time of great need. You truly are shameful and I demand that you change your policy wording which is a bunch of lines. You state that ‘At PayPal, we aim to provide you with the highest possible standard of Customer Service. If you feel that the level of service you received was unsatisfactory, please let us know so that we'll have the opportunity to set it right.’ Yeah right! Having spoken to over 30 different agents not one of your agents put it right!
