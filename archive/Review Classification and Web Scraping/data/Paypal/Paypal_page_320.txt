I have had multiple issues with paypal in the past, however, it seems as though Paypal hold your money until you take action and contact customer services and even then they're useless. They never explain the issue and you're left with no clue as to what is happening. I should not have to wait nearly two whole weeks to receive a mere 15 pound from a friend. I then had to contact them as it was going to make me wait a further 4 days for a code because my bank doesn't accept withdrawals yet as I had not confirmed it. It says they add spending and withdrawal limits. There is absolutely no guidance available anywhere produced by them that shows you how to do these complicated steps to get money. Its my own money? I shouldn't have to wait that long to use my own money in my account rather than through paypal. It charged me a pound to get the code for my bank and it came out straight away and said i had to wait four days to recieve it. If somebody desperately needed to receive money they'd be in a mess.

I called my credit card company after and they said that they did not receive the money from paypal and to file a dispute. In this dispute in paypal, I had won and finally received the money back. But PayPal charged me 119.98, stating that they paid me 2 times for the refund. I called them and was treated with hostility and was hung up on when I asked for a supervisor. The customer service helper identified themselves as Riya. Riya told me, "not to hang up" and then hung up on me. They were being rude and told me to stop talking. They also had a nasty attitude. You can check the recording of the call. They told me to call the bank and I had explained I already had but Riya said it doesn\'t matter because they sent a confirmation email. However, I had explained with detail to them that I had called already and My credit card company did not receive the money and told them the exact date and time of the refunds.
