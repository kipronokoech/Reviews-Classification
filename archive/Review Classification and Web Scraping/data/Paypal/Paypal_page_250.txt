The buyer received the goods and even sent a message through PayPal to acknowledge receipt. The PayPal promise of "Seller Protection" amounts to nothing. Their Customer Service, apart from offering platitudes of "everything will be OK", is useless and there is no protection against credit-card charge backs - so what\'s the point of paying a PayPal fee on the transaction? What service is PayPal actually providing ? PayPal should accept responsibility for buyers who log in to their own PayPal accounts to make payments, since they claim to have "strong customer authentication". There is a serious disjoint and disfunction between PayPal and the Credit Card companies. If PayPal provides a payment platform, then it needs to take responsibility for the payment cards it accepts and the verification of the user account of the buyer making the payment. Otherwise what\'s the point: Anyone can spend away and then just claim "unauthorised transaction" and get their money back and keep the goods ?\n\nI\'ve been using PayPal for 20 years but it\'s no longer the same company since they split from eBay.\n\nCustomer Service tells you what you want to hear, however, their subsequent actions are totally different.
