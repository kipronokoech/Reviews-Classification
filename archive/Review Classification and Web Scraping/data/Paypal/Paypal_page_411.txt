So they reappeared at my door.\nBecause the Ebay return 'thought' they were in the process of being returned, there was no way of progressing this further or advising them.\nSo I turned to Paypal. Hmm, won't be doing that again.\nOpened a claim. Meanwhile Ebay decided that as I'd opened a claim with Paypal, this negated my claim with them and charged me for the utterly pointless attempt to return the boots to the UK address.\nActually did manage to phone Paypal, once they told me I'd have to return the boots (again). But surprise, surprise.. this time the return address was China. So actually spoke to a live human being (albeit one who seemed very robotic in her replies) and explained: criminal, fake goods, refusing returns. No matter, she said, you have return them - and at your cost. But what if he refuses them again? I asked.\nAs long as we can see that you've dispatched them, tracked, you'll be covered, she said.\n£25.50 later (Post Office best value to China), off they go to China, tracked. Then I get an email from Pay pal explaining that once the seller confirms receipt, I'll get my refund.\nWho wants to bet they'll either reappear back here again, or be 'lost'?\nIncredible that they are aware of someone breaking the law, selling counterfeit goods, (and he sold 70 pairs of these in the run up to Xmas before ceasing trading) claiming to be in UK when not... but actually support the seller.
