I was banned from PayPal for having suspicious activity on my account even though the account has only been used about 3 or 4 times to sell some items on eBay. I haven’t used the account in weeks and all of a sudden, I’ve been banned. But that’s not what annoyed me, what annoyed me was when I called PayPal customer support, I was told that they couldn’t tell me why my account was banned because only the legal department could do that, they proceeded to give me a an address where I could send a letter, just to ask what I did wrong. I was told that I could not receive or send money through PayPal anymore even though they could give me no reason why a account that only has a few transactions was banned. PayPal’s problem isn’t with there services, PayPal’s problem is in customer service and protection for their customers, and for that reason, I would never recommend PayPal to anyone I know.', 'review_date': '2019-07-19', 'review_time': '11:00:22', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
