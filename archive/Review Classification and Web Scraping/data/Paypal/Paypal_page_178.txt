My bank had no record of the transfers, but I can see them completed on Paypal. Beyond that, instant transfer should mean instant transfer, especially when they charge you a fee. Instant transfer doesn’t mean instant transfer, because they don’t want you to have your money in your bank right away. They want you to get your money within 1-3 days so that you get frustrated and sign up for their additional services.

{'platform': 'Paypal', 'id': '62e486838000af4a884f2443', 'stars': 1, 'title': "Avoid paypal - Unless you're a masochist", 'message': 'Why is paypal is a horrible company?\n\n1. While attempting to login, paypal "can\'t confirm it\'s you".\n\nThis happens several times a month. No attempt by the paypal site to have me verify anything. Just a big "NOPE". So you have to phone them and have the customer service agent verify it\'s you.\n\nWhich means they ask you to confirm things like: credit card number, phone number, address, etc.. What, in effect, they are doing is logging into your account at their end. Why the *** doesn\'t the website let me do that? Completely useless.\n\n2. Trying to link a bank account to a paypal account.\n\nI provide bank account info. with which they\'re supposed to make "two small deposits" to your account. I\'m supposed to use that info to verify the bank account.\n\nI waited days and nothing. I cancel that request and attempt the verification again...nothing. I try a third time and wait 5 days, nothing. So I contact them.\n\nI\'m on the phone for 45mins, the agent assures me that paypal has sent the transactions to my bank, that the fault lies with my bank and I should contact them to resolve the issue. Right.\n\nAfter calling my bank and confirming that, no, paypal has not attempted any transaction or verification process with them.\n\nI call paypal...yet, again. I\'m on with them another 30mins before the agent informs me that they\'ll just verify the bank account at their end and in 24hrs my bank account will be added to my paypal account.\n\n...what!???! At any point in time with me speaking with them over the last two weeks, an agent could have just manually verified my bank account? WHY THE *** DIDN\'T THEY JUST DO THAT TO BEGIN WITH!??!?\n\n3. I thank the agent for their assistance and (channelling my kindest inner Karen) ask if it would be possible for me to, please, speak to a supervisor.\n\n"Sure, please hold while find someone." They\'re gone 1min, "All our managers are on calls right now." No problem I inform them I\'m happy to hold. 5mins later, "All our managers are still on calls. We would be happy to call you back." No, thank you, but I really don\'t have faith that anyone will call me back, because I\'ve done this dance with them before (They won\'t call you back, they deny the customer at any and every step. They wear you down so that you just give up trying and simply continue to let them milk you for fees).\n\nThey keep checking if I\'d prefer them to call me back because everyone is busy on calls. I tell them I\'m perfectly happy to wait on hold, because I have little faith they\'ll attempt to call back. Eventually the agent comes back and instead of the call centre template "All our managers are still on..." they say, "Sir? Sir?\nAre you still there?" Which I am, I say I am, they feign that they can\'t hear me then they hang up.\n\n4. High fees.\n\nOne of the worst in the industry. I\'m just using my credit card from now on. Lower fees and I won\'t have to constantly phone paypal to allow me into my own account.\n\n5. paypal\'s contempt for it\'s customers is barely disguised.\n\nWhile you\'re on hold the friendly recorded message (aside from the "your call is important to us" schtick) continually suggests that instead of contacting paypal, the customer should submit their question, complaint or problem to the paypal community forum and have other paypal users offer assistance.\n\nBecause why should paypal waste time or money to assist customers when other customers can do their job for them.\n\n6. Regarding complaint 1 and 2\n\nEverything that a paypal customer service agent is doing when you\'re on a call with them, is exactly what we the customers should be able to do, on our own, without having to contact them. Every question they ask us and we provide the answer to, they input to their computers to gain access to our accounts.\n\nEverything they do is supposed to suggest that they are taking care of our security and interests, that they\'re needed by us. However, that\'s only because paypal causes so many problems for customers and arbitrarily denies us access to our accounts, that we are forced into begging for assistance.The exact same assistance we should be able to provide for ourselves if their website allowed us to.\n\npaypal is a parasitic blight, milking their customers whilst arbitrarily manufacturing the need for their assistance; which, in fact, is meagre at best, malignant at worst. If I could give it zero stars, I would.\n\nAvoid using paypal at all costs.', 'review_date': '2022-07-30', 'review_time': '03:16:51', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
