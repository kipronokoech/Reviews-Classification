Bob tried to transfer 7.5K but could only do 4K in one transaction so we decided to use Venmo for the rest. PayPal determined that instead of going into my personal\nPPl acct it went into my business Acct. It defaulted to this despite Bob choosing it was a non- business transaction. Well, PPl determined it was a business transaction and took $120 off the top for their fee. It was like ok whatever. I’ll eat it. Then I try to transfer it into my bank acct but it’s on hold for up to 20 days to “cover” both parties interests should something be wrong with the product. Complete nonsense and after waiting 1hr and 50min on hold I hung up and opted for the call back. Never during my wait did the automated on hold service tell me how long the wait would be. UGH.\nI finally get an Indian woman on the phone and she says she can’t do anything. This is their policy for online purchases. I fully explained this was not an online purchase etc etc. whatever. Couldn’t change it. They advised that I refund the money to Bob (which I did). Bob has my car and 4k of my money that he now can’t access until it clears PPl and his bank!!!!

The next day a representative authorized a transfer that I never authorized. Then the next representative told me to transfer my funds to my business account, never to mention that it would cost over $5 to transfer PayPal to your own PayPal account. When i did the transfer I was charged the huge fee, then charged another double to send my fee to my bank, which one fee i understand. But he acted like loosing 10$ without telling me beforehand was normal and ok without telling me beforehand. Always have problems with paypal. Im done with them. Will never use them again. use venmo or zelle where there are no charges. Can you believe it, transferring your own money to your own account costed me over $10, without warning.
