If they harass you long enough you will finally give up, take a financial lost and close the case. They must have been taken over by the USPS. I purchased a guitar and when I received it the neck was damaged. I called the seller and he send me a prepaid return shipping label. Upon receipt of the guitar he agreed to refund all but $100.00 in his attempt to recoup his shipping costs. I filed a complaint with PayPal and the nightmare began. They have no idea what they are doing. I would send written info they asked for and then I would receive the same request for the same info as if they never got it. All automated forms. I would call PayPal and get someone who had no clue. After countless calls I finally get an email informing the seller has agreed to refund the $99.33. But the email states I need to return the guitar which was done 3 weeks earlier. After an hour on the phone I get through to a HUMAN. After going over all this which was like trying to explain 3rd year algebra to a 6 year old they tell me I need to provide the tracking number for the return of the guitar. Fortunately, I had made a copy of the shipping label. While I am waiting on the human I entered the Fed Ex tracking number and print out a proof of delivery form. I tell the person on the phone I have a proof of delivery form and they ask me to email it to them. I immediately receive and email response that has nothing to do with what we are doing. When I asked what is next I am told they will contact me if they need any more info from me. What in the world could they want now. Pictures of my last colonoscopy. The seller has agreed to pay the $99.33. Trying to communicate with PayPal is like asking someone what is their favorite color and their response is “fried chicken”. There is a new Bully in the financial world and it is called PayPal. I used PayPal 3 years ago to purchase a Honda Generator online. It ended up being a scam. I contacted PayPal and they said it would take weeks to get my $1000.00 returned. I immediately called Visa and told them and the $1000 was credited back to my account within 24 hours. Why would anyone use PayPal if the credit card company made it so easy? Only because PayPal is the only way to pay online with some merchants. This has got to change. When I asked Visa what they would do about the money their response was that they have a special department that handles that. If Visa can do it so can PayPal. And BTW at Visa I talked to an American who didn’t start the conversation with “NOT TO WORRY”! That is as bad as the server whose response to a question is “NO PROBLEM”. Why not “My Pleasure”.
