One month ago, an Ebay buyer tried to claim an issue with the item to get a refund, without returning the item to me. This buyer first appealed to Ebay. Ebay quickly closed the case without issuing him a refund. The buyer then appealed to PayPal for a refund. Paypal asked me for a response on this issue. They told me that if I would not respond within 10 days, they would automatically issue a refund to the buyer. I tried to enter my response and supporting files on their resolution system for several times. However, their system never displayed that had received my response and other files. I also messaged Paypal customer services for several times to help me enter my response. But none of the customer services was able to help me. I did not know why they could not just enter my response to the case. Finally one day before the last date that must enter my response, I just entered my response on the resolution system, and it worked. After this experience, I closed my Paypal account.', 'review_date': '2020-09-08', 'review_time': '18:25:28', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
