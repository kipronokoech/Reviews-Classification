Paypal refuses to help me, telling me that the fraudulent transaction was authorized. Sim porting is a common way hackers are gaining access to your PayPal while making it look like it was an authorized transaction. Every other service I have talked to (visa, my own bank union, Canadian antifraud centre) has been extremely helpful and is aware of this form of fraud. The PayPal customer service representatives have treated me like I am the criminal and have refused to believe that hackers have found a way to trick their authentication algorithm. They have zero support when it comes to helping their customers. I would highly suggest that everyone deletes their PayPal account.
