I am aware that warranty ran out after 12 months. Apple not interested. Also left a review about them. Looked up if I have any rights. Which I do under the Consumer Act. Made a claim under section 75. Advising PayPal that my phone is not fit for purpose as whenever I use it calls are breaking up & the other person cannot make out what I’m saying. Despite providing evidence of issues raised with Apple and network provider. PayPal say I haven’t proven my case.\nHave gone to the Financial Ombudsman.\nBut PayPal users need to know the following;\n“We are withdrawing from the Voluntary Jurisdiction of the Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS) on 1 December 2022. This means that if your complaint relates to an event that occurred before 1 January 2021 and you are unhappy with how we have addressed that complaint in this final response, you must refer that complaint to the FOS before 1 December 2022 if you would like FOS to look at it”.\nWhat does this suggest ?\nLess organisation’s to help the lowly UK consumer when dealing with companies like this.\nI know I’m a little fish in a big pond, concerning this situation.\nAs soon as a decision is reached by the Ombudsman I will be closing my account. They won’t care. But it will make me feel a lot better.\nBuyer protection & the Consumer Act is not considered by this company.\nThey don’t even give Trustpilot the option of being notified of reviews. I wonder why.\nShame on you PayPal.', 'review_date': '2022-08-08', 'review_time': '22:00:53', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
