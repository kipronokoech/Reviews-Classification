Out of the blue, I was asked to confirm my card and bank details again??? I then could not withdraw money, because although it confirmed by debit card, it would not confirm my bank account. I could not withdraw money. Luckily I managed to transfer it to a friend.\n\nThis PayPal is the worst company I have ever seen for its multi billion valuation. They are playing the numbers game. They have built a massive client base, and now do not care if there are issues.\n\nThe whole mobile app is a shambles ever since the last upgrade. There is zero customer service or customer care. No one should use PayPal for this reason alone. I have mostly paid for items but seldom sell. If I had not got the money to a friend, there would be no way to withdraw my funds.\n\nThe chat box on the app is disgraceful. You cannot see what you type as you type it, so when it uploads, there are so many typos it is hard to understand what you write.\n\nThe phone app is currently working like a garage built website.\n\nIt's a disgrace.

We were told that in April those funds should have been released and yet we mark another month and still no access. I have threatened to contact a lawyer and the BBB and consumer affairs and it didn't seem to phase them This company is unethical and lacks customer service. The reviews speak for themselves online.
