Many symbols and actually most of them on their list are just regular things people use in daily life like OK hand symbol but their TOS states it depends if it is used as hate in context or not.\nTHE BIG PROBLEM with this is that they can decide what the context was, they can decide whether what you did was hate context or not and ban you from using their service - service of anything ADL collaborates with - like Paypal here. And they have been doing so to many people who did nothing of hate context, undeserved.\n\nThis is just cherry on top for Paypal, and one that prompted me to finally write a review.
