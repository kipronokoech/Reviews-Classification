{'platform': 'Paypal', 'id': '60ba54f7f9f4870b70179232', 'stars': 1, 'title': 'Poor Customer Service', 'message': "I have been transferring funds through PayPal for several years now. Since 2017 I have transferred fairly large amounts to the same individual, as in $650 to $750 at a time every single month using PayPal. And suddenly, I transferred $840 (not much more than I normally transfer each month), to the same individual I always send funds to every month, and PayPal flagged the transaction as suspicious. That is odd and poor customer service. Especially since I have a long history of sending similar amounts of money to the same individual, and suddenly they want to flag my transfer even though there is literally nothing unusual about the transfer whatsoever? This doesn't make sense, and of course, since PayPal flagged the transfer they have placed a hold on the funds so that the individual I sent the funds to can't even access these funds. I spent some real time trying to locate a number to call a customer service representative with PayPal and trying to get through to a representative only to be given a standard, generic response, that all transfers may take 5-7 business days. Well, after I pressed the representative for more information it turned out that they had flagged the transfer. PayPal didn't notify me that they flagged the transfer either, they just left me completely in the dark as to why it has now been 7 days since I completed a normal transfer and yet PayPal still hasn't released the funds.\nThe customer service was not great though the customer service is often poor with PayPal. Recently, a friend told me that she has had issues with her PayPal account as well. And from what I am reading online, other people have had issues with PayPal unnecessarily flagging transfers as well and placing lengthy holds on their funds. With all of this hassle trying to simply complete a routine transfer through PayPal, it's not worth it. I'd rather transfer funds virtually any other way. I ordered checks to avoid using PayPal to transfer funds in the future and if you're looking for a hassle free way to transfer funds, Venmo is a much better alternative. This is what happens when a corporation tries to make too many of their processes automated. An automated system will make errors that a human representative will not make. I guarantee you that PayPal's automated system flagged this transaction I am referring to and if a human representative had viewed the same transaction they would have approved it and a hold would not have been placed on my funds. If you try to send a message to PayPal, you also have to first go through their automated system which is often useless and frustrating to communicate with. PayPal wants to cut corners and save money by replacing human assistants with automated systems and the customer service has greatly declined as a result. So PayPal saves money, at the expense of the consumer.", 'review_date': '2021-06-04', 'review_time': '16:33:04', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

PayPal may deduct such damages directly from any existing PayPal balance in any PayPal Account you created, own and or control.\n\nThe specific activities that may subject you to an assessment of damages by PayPal can be found in the Acceptable Use Policy.\n\nIt is my pleasure to assist you.
