They even made us verify the account multiple times which took at least a day to reflect in our bank feeds. After verifying and re-verifying we still could not transfer the funds. We were then told it was our bank that was causing the issue and to contact them. After having to call our bank twice and being informed they didn\'t even see the balance even hitting their servers.
