Some aspects of PayPal are really useful, but you must monitor their actions or you will be out some of your hard-earned money. Some of my experiences with customer service were crazy. Refunds can be tricky. Just like any company who handles your money, you need to monitor and contact them constantly if there is an issue. It does take them a long time to deliberate about seemingly unusual situations. However, the good uses outweigh the problem areas in their system if you use your bank credit card to make payments.
