They actually don't read your email. 2) To request to talk on the phone requires you look at information they think you need. Only then will they give you a code and the phone number to call. And, after business hours, they give you a code but no phone number to call. If you eventually get to an agent they are jumpy and scared, like they have been abused. The guy I finally talked to was helpful. He frankly said the information he had access to was limited and all he could do was to manually initiate a program to clear any blocks -- we'll see if that works.
