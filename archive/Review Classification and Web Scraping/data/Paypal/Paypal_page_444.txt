Got my account limited for no reason asking for document information on my business, refuses to tell me what sort of documents. Had to go around asking people that have encountered the same problem to see how they solved it. I submitted documents based on what they did, mine was rejected so I went through multiple conversations asking what documents they need (no replies, skirting around the issue), at one point went through PayPal Twitter's customer service as well, they told me they checked my account and the documents they are asking for do not actually apply to me business type and told me to explain to the CS on their message center, which I've been doing from the start. Keeps telling me to wait 24-48 hours for a call for a follow-up but it never happens, I keep having to start new conversations and get in contact with MORE of their bot-like agents that are all of a broken record hivemind refusing to answer my questions or elaborate on the problem and going on repeat transferring me to other people, promising me a follow-up that never comes. At one point the limit was lifted and I thought it was finally over, then a day later it was back again asking for the same things I previously took 4!!! Conversations!!! to explain!!! Per their OWN advice!!! from Twitter PayPal!!! I was told this time was 'different' but received no explanation as to what was wrong now when nothing changed within a day!!! Took to facebook to explain my situation, they flagged me down for profanity which was admittedly my bad so I apologized and asked if i could receive help now, they then flagged me for duplicate posting which just doesn't make sense??? And other people are doing it too, or even worse??? I questioned them that they are still not addressing the real problem in my posts and asked if they have a number I could call, which I was then blocked after.\n\nDon't use PayPal, just don't.

Like the following review just posted minutes ago: (December 1, 2020)\n\nPorsha808\n1 review US 5 stars: Excellent\nUpdated 26 minutes ago\nPAYPAL is a MUST for ALL ONLINE TRANSACTIONs\nIf you do anything online (buy, sell) Paypal is a def must!! They are seriously the only online “protection” we have in today’s world. Venmo is also an awesome, safe cash app owned by Paypal (of course!). Paypal STOPS scammerS from scamming. Thank you for keeping online sales, trading, buying .. clean & honest!! Great Job Paypal!! Forever grateful ❤️\n\nComment:\n\nI don't know why this guy seems so happy. What he says is false. For one thing it's not a MUST for online transactions. There are many other alternatives and PayPal is actually not that popular. In fact eBay has been working on cutting all ties with PayPal for years and at this very moment are forcing many of their sellers to switch from PayPal to their own payment processing system.\n\nHis other claim, that PayPal keeps scammers at bay, is false. There are a lot of scammers using PayPal as can be witnessed by all the painful reviews right on this site...\n\nTo make things worse, since the pandemic PayPal has managed to avoid almost ALL PHONE SUPPORT! If you have any kind of problems they force you to send them a message in the chat portal, and tell you it will take a few hours to get back to you, which it does, or it might even take DAYS or maybe they never get back to you.\n\nIf they do get back to you, usually they might give you wrong answers, or refuse to solve your issues, or blame you for the problem. They might even just CLOSE YOUR ACCOUNT so you can't touch your own money for 180 DAYS (6 MONTHS.) PayPal was sued in a Class Action Lawsuit a couple years ago and the LOST and had to pay people back some money and damages. But PayPal continues doing the same things.\n\nIn fact their customer support employees are so unfamiliar with PayPal's policies and operation, that they might even give you terrible advice that will get your account closed/banned due to telling you things that are against policy! This is what happened to me. I followed one of their employees advice (on the phone, yes I did find a way to get someone) and he was doing his best to be helpful, he was also a long time employee, I don't blame him, but the advice he gave me didn't really solve my problem and ultimately caused PayPal to freeze my account for 6 months... Things like this just shouldn't happen. It also caused me to waste a lot of time trying to get them to do what I was asking and they kept rejecting me. So talking with someone didn't help, maybe just hurt! (BTW, all I wanted to do was to change my old nickname to my real legal name which should be easy and was actually done on my 2nd account a month earlier!!!!)\n\nSometimes you might get lucky and get a competent support person and you might even get your problem solved. IF YOU ARE LUCKY! But otherwise you gotta be ready for horrible customer support and just plain abuse.\n\nAlso the people that do try to help you in the chat portal, are never the same person. So one person replies, and when you reply, another person replies, and the replies don't necessarily match, like nobody knows what the others have said or are doing, or what the problem is, or what the PayPal policies are.\n\nSure you might use PayPal and everything might go just fine, like if you use it to buy online, things will probably go fine, but just hope nothing goes wrong because then you will have a tough time solving it in all likelihood. But don't ever keep money in PayPal because that money, well it's not yours till you get it in your hands, because PayPal might just freeze it for any crazy reason, and they don't need to even tell you why! Then maybe you can get it back in 6 months. Hopefully.\n\nNo company that has NO decent customer support is any good! For a company to be decent there has to be CUSTOMER SUPPORT that actually takes you seriously and you can quickly get a response.\n\nThe only thing PayPal cares about these days is doing mass transactions for banks who don't have a good online presence, so they process their payments, they call it PayFlow... They probably treat them very well, and you can get people on the phone quickly through that. But for the average customer, PayPal is really not a good choice. As I said, there are many other options these days. PayPal should be your last choice in the world these days! Maybe if they get their customer support back together one day it will be good, but so far, forget about it!
