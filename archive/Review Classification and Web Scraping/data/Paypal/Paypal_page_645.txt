I understand they need to be secure, but secure enough that the owner can't have access and the staff can't or won't unlock the limitation. Really? Their website was having a problem, so it said try withdrawing again in 10 mins. So I did, it then said it again. What I didn't know was I was locking myself out of my own account, by coming back and trying again as they told me to.\n\nWhen you call to unlock it, the accounts limitations team (who's job it is to deal with account withdrawal limitations) can't unlock my account. There is no empathy because it isn't their money, even their manager Havana was rude. 'we are not a bank we are a transaction facilitator'. That's why you're sat on my funds for 6 days even though I have 2 factor authentication. Seems secure enough to me. They are the worst customer service I have dealt with. Such a shame that ebay are pounded over a stump being their only method of payment. Well not for long. When ebay do change provider in 2020, just don't use them again.
