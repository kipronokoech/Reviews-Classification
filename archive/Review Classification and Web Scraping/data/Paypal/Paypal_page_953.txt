PayPal asked me to pay a police report for the missing item...as disappointed as I was I certainly was not going to keep the police busy with that complaint.

I tried Paypal to receive payment for a while, only to find my received payments would occasionally "Disappear" with no trace (fortunately they were small amounts). Paypal would tell me that it must have been an error on my behalf. How could it be MY fault when all I did was log on and go to "my account" to see my balance and notice that it was less than in should be?? PayPal’s fees, like the national debt kept growing out of control, so I stopped using them. When you totaled Ebay’s selling fees with PayPal’s fees, I was giving a considerable amount of my profit to these two giants. So, I stopped selling on Ebay. Apparently Ebay now only uses Paypal as a method of making or receiving payments. Can you say MONOPOLY??? I could make more money, selling things for less locally and eliminating Paypal and Ebay\'s s ridiculous fees. I still use Paypal to buy things (no alternative in most cases), though I get nervous about it every time. I only use gift cards or credit cards with a $200.00 limit.
