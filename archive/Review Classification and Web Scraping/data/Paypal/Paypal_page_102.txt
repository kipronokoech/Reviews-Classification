I called Paypal customer service (a number I found online but not on the Paypal online site itself) and after the Paypal recording did everything it could to discourage me from talking to a real person, I was finally connected. And I can certainly understand the company's reluctance to have anyone talk to a real Paypal person. The first person had no idea of what this charge meant (i.e., the *9 charge description) and she could find no record of it on Paypal's own internal records. This person then mistakenly connected me to someone in Paypal's loan department who, understandably (since this did not involve a loan), knew nothing regarding this charge, and he could find no record of it either. Long story short--I have been charged a significant amount of money that shows up both on my credit card account and on my personal Paypal account but for which Paypal itself apparently has no record or explanation! And now I am supposed to wait for a call from Paypal. Yea, like that's going to happen. I have now removed all credit card information from my Paypal account and will not use this service again.\nUPDATE: Someone from Paypal did call me back and he was able to find the charge and explain it to me. He had no idea why the other two Paypal individuals were not able to find it.", 'review_date': '2023-02-15', 'review_time': '00:08:08', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

They had the appearance of a UK company and I paid for the item using Paypal, thinking their buyer protection was actually worth something.\nThe item was nothing like the ads and videos suggested and was not fit for purpose.\nI requested an immediate return/refund and instead was offered £3.00 as a 'good will gesture'. Naturally I refused and asked to return the useless item for a refund. I provided solid proof that the item was nothing like the one described online, and the offered £8.00 this time, which I again refused.\nI was asked to return the item to China, despite it allegedly being sent from the USA with bogus tracking info.\nThe cost to send it to China with tracking was £18, so I opted to the £7.00 option (45 days to arrive), with proof of posting provided.\nIn the mean time I claimed a refund from Paypal who requested all my evidence and correspondence, which I duly provided to them; they also asked for tracking info for the return, which of course I didn't have. Paypal rejected my claim on those grounds.\nI also wrote to the Chinese scammers, pointing out that they would have definitely received the return by now and asked for a refund again. They didn't even reply.\nSo the moral of the story is; don't buy junk off Facebook anymore and don't use Paypal for anything ever again; they are useless and are supporting these scam companies to separate people from their hard earned cash.\nDate posted: 13 Feb 2023", 'review_date': '2023-02-13', 'review_time': '23:17:04', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
