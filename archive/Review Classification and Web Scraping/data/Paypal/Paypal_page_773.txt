Not being very good with the internet, i purchased a phone from a company called Toby\'s Deals paid via Paypal. I received an email from Toby\'s Deals advising the product was not in stock, they would advise when back in stock, which they did. They sent a tracking number/link , but unable to track, i started to get very concerned. This phone never arrived, alarm bells rang, after checking their website i knew it was a scam, (silly i should have checked before). I contacted Paypal, after investigation their response/ conclusion was in the sellers favour. I called and explained again what had happened and the customer service assistant advised i should get intouch with o my bank and recall the funds.. The bank informed me that the reason you pay via Paypal is for reassurance in instances like this. I contacted Paypal on 27 December, they came back to me today and said they are happy with the information supplied by Toby\'s Deals and the phone was delivered, it most certainly wasn\'t. I ordered the same phone via Amazon, as this was a gift. PayPal advertises all sorts of "protections", and i feel they are not honouring them. The explanation re the appeal, i felt wasn\'t qualified. I thought Paypal was there to help honest people like myself, not side with these companies the scam genuine individuals. I cannot tell you how upset i am over this and how disappointed i am in Paypal.', 'review_date': '2018-12-28', 'review_time': '11:25:59', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

I went to my bank and did what they asked me to do so they can reinstate the account, but my bank did not have the information because it was years ago. So i called back and the second agent said that I must provide this information. I finally asked to speak to a supervisor and OMG she was the rudest woman I have ever spoke with, she told me all the information the agents gave me were wrong and there is no way they can reinstate my account. I tried telling her this was a mistake, I tried telling her there is thousands of dollars in the right account that I have been using and that i\nnever missed a payment and that i have never used that account that caused the payment to be rejected. She was just super rude and I hope they can listen to the tape. Before she even hears what i had to say she said "I will not reinstate your account" She said if the computer closes the account there is nothing they can do. So I said it is a mistake and they happen, this is why I am talking to human not a computer, because the computer won\'t understand. Fourth time I found out they can reinstate the account if the mistake was from my bank not me. I spoke with two supervisors and both were very disrespectful, degraded and humiliated me in every tone.\nFirst supervisor\'s name: TIONA (ID#5358).\nSecond Supervisor\'s name: KERA (ID 6645)\nI asked Kera for her supervisor after she was laughing at me and she said she does not have a supervisor.\n\nI thought by explaining to actual humans the error that occurred, they would understand.', 'review_date': '2018-12-28', 'review_time': '04:55:06', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
