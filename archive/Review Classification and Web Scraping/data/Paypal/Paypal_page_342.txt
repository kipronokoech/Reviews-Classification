NO ONE should EVER deduct the entire several thousands from your linked bank account without notifying you nor your authorization (just because few% of fees incurred for a cancelled transaction on my eBay acct, and Paypal tried to get it back right away. But they deducted the whole transaction amount from my bank acct instead just the fees...) That was a WRONGFUL business practice!\nI believe PayPal has turned away many of its formal customers due to this type of unethical and unfair policies and practices.\nThere is always a better opportunity somewhere else to consumers that we should look for...
