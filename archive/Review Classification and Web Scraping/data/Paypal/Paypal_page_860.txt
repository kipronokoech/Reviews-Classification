I lost a dispute and forced to accept return of goods I had sold. Fair enough. The funds for these goods had been frozen in Paypal pending the result of the dispute. Following dispute resolution for reasons beyond my comprehension, the funds were made available in my Paypal account but shortly thereafter disappeared! Literally! I, wrongly as it turns out, assumed the funds had been returned to my buyer. All indications on the Paypal account suggested the buyer had been refunded and there was no trace of the funds!\nA few weeks passed without giving the matter a second thought. I then ventured into the mirky depths of my E-Bay account, a complex and confusing area to say the least. There I found in BOLD RED LETTERS you owe us money! Strangely it was the exact amount concerned in the dispute.\nI contacted customer services and informed them that this money had been returned via Paypal as indicated by the missing money from my Paypal account. I was informed that E-Bay had in fact returned the funds to my buyer and not Paypal. I was immediately concerned that the buyer had been refunded twice.\nI took issue with Paypal customer services, Same crowd different badges! They were diabolical too. Through several phone calls and much stress I established that the missing money was being ‘Retained’ pending my settlement of the money owed to E-Bay. I have no problem with this but the fact there was absolutely no visible record of this concerned me deeply. To all intents and purposes this money had simply disappeared.\nHaving persuaded Paypal to return my money to my Paypal account I quickly removed the funds to my bank account from where I paid the money due to E-Bay.\nJob Done………or so you would think!\nThe very next day I checked my Paypal account to find this exact same amount of money had been taken from there in favour of…you guessed it E-Bay. I contact Paypal customer service to be told the I had made a payment to E-Bay Europe and they had made an exact duplicate payment to E-Bay International! I might add that the payment I made, through ‘make a one time payment’ section in E-Bay was done so on the advice of customer service.\nI have no authorised payment method for Paypal on my E-Bay account, I prefer to use my bank account. Despite this E-Bay managed to get funds without authorisation from my Paypal account.\nAs I write I am still awaiting resolution of this matter.\nI will not hold my breath. The customer service from both companies was useless, frustrating and often downright arrogant.\nI am not a business, selling on E-bay was sporadic at best. I will never sell on E-Bay again. I will limit my Paypal use to absolute minimum. If I have the option to enter my debit card details whilst online shopping I will take the two minutes to do so in future and avoid the ‘faster checkout’ method of Paypal.\nDisgusted by both E-Bay and Paypal and I would urge all users to keep a sharp eye on all transactions done through both.\nSorry that was the short version!! :-{', 'review_date': '2017-01-06', 'review_time': '13:33:48', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

In the email, there were no instructions on who to contact at PayPal to resolve the issue (Strike One). So I researched it through my bank, who told me there was no problem with my card, and that they did not even see an attempt made by PayPal to charge in that amount against my debit card. They recommended that PayPal simply reprocess the request.\n\nI go to my PayPal account and my current, active card was flagged as being declined. I was not allow to resubmit it as my payment method through the website. NOR WERE THERE ANY INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO DO THIS! (Strike Two).\n\nI then called the number I finally found through the Call us page. Having no clue as to how to address this, I had to listen to all the options and guess what option I had to choose. I ended up in the wrong department (because there was no information on who to contact to correct this issue). After talking to the first person, and having to explain the entire situation twice, as well as clarify what had happened (Strike Three-- bad training) -- I was put on Hold. By now I have spent over 45 minutes researching this issue (including the 30 minutes I spent on the phone with this less than effective customer service person).\n\nBy the time he got back and told me I to talk to Collections to resolve this issue, I was getting very annoyed. I was upset that I had to go to COLLECTIONS for what appeared to be a PAYPAL issue! Ok, so was put on hold and transferred. Either Agent no. 1 either didn\'t write up my case, or Agent no. 2 didn\'t take the time to at least read the notes. So I have to explain my story in full for a 3rd time (Strike Four).\n\nAgent #2 tried to explain that the declining bank is one that I no longer have an account with -- which is quite odd because on the screen I saw it was quite clear that my preferred card was the one active with the bank that I currently do business with. (By the way, I did try to remove the other bank information a while back, but it obviously did not "take." -- strike six, faulty interface.). Agent #2 was quite condenscending -- which is very insulting, especially to someone who is already annoyed (Strike Five) Actually, I had told him when I started the call that I was already quite po\'d, and that I had already spent 30 min on the phone with PayPal. So we get it authorized.\n\nFollow-Up -- Then, I get an email follow-p "We\'ve added a Credit to your PayPal account ... We thought you\'d like to know that we\'ve added a credit to your PayPal account." They did no such thing -- they corrected the error that THEIR system created. Adding a credit implies that you have given me some extra money for the time and inconvenience I experienced (Strike Six)\n\nAdditionally, that "we thought you\'d like to know"line is condescending (Strike Seven), and entirely inappropriate for a financial transaction (Strike Eight), I am a professional business writer and I would no more use such a phrase for financial correspondence than fly to the moon. My bank doesn\'t send me little messages saying "We thought you\'d like to know that your paycheck was deposited." or "You may be interested in knowing that you are overdrawn."\n\nFinally, there is no link to a survey or comments in the Follow-up Email (Strike Nine). (Actually, there is a strike Ten -- I found the Feedback Link and the comments only allow 1000 characters -- so I had to basically send the above review in little batches) I\'ve cancelled my account', 'review_date': '2017-01-05', 'review_time': '20:07:19', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

When I called last week that the transaction was still processing I was told 3-5 business days! Customer service obviously has no clue, and just attempts to 'placate' the customer with the most reasonable story they can make up at the time.
