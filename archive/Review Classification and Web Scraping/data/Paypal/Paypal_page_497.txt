the advisor said i should now go back in and change my password , and asked if there was anything else he could do for me and couldn\'t wait to get off the phone, after hanging up i attempted to go in abd change my password ... no access so i say i forgot and a message comes up saying a one time code will be sent to xxxxxxxxx106 ? thats not my phone number so apparently the fraudster is still alive and well in my account? i phone paypal back wait 25 mins to get to speak to someone have to explain everything all over and the advisor says "i see you\'ve\nhad some trouble " yes i said i was told my account was now sterile and fraudster free and yet i cant log in because the access code being sent is going to be sent to someone other than myself , so she has a look and say "i dont see anything wrong" ? so i had to prompt her to check the emails on my account and any phone numbers ,well surprise surprise theres more than a few phone numbers and emails on my account , but how can that be if the last advisor cleaned them all out so she sends me a link to change my password again which i do and im able to change my password ... so now this advisor is ready to jump ship and leave me saying all will be fine now,\nim way ahead and have already tried to log in and im locked out already while shes still on the phone? she was actually uttering the phrase " you should be ok now thats it sorted? , then i told her that while she was talking i tried it and im still locked out ... do these advisors actually know what they are doing at all? then she mutters "thats very strange" she then says she will send another code via txt for me to gain access to a "change password" dialog and it worked,\nthis time she says make up another password but dont try it just now wait for 10 minutes , i said i didnt like that idea as in 10 minute if it didnt work then i would be left high and dry again, so yes i tried it half an hour later and guess what it tells me my password is wrong? here we go ... so i hit the link to reset the password and the message on screen says "a one time code will be sent to xxxxxxxx106 the hackers number so im right back where i started despite one hour on the phone with one advisor and another 55 mins on the phone with another? too late to phone back as its now approaching midnight so i phone first thing in the morning and i get the same advisor that dumped me the first time , we then spent 30 or so minutes tryin this and that none of which made a bit of difference, then she says it sometimes takes up to 36 hours for changes we make to take effect? come on now im ready for launching myself out the window,\nnow shes talking nonsense and im getting nowhere, she then says is there anything else i can help you with today??? yes i say you canremove all traced of the fraudster so my account can carry on and i can change the password and get on with my life, her answer was " it will be fine now just give it some time and it will start working normally , is she serious?\nso i come off the phone to the help line who have been no help and i wait 12hrs then i give it a final try\nmessage on the screen says "password or user is wrong" so i say i forgot my password and the next message says " a one time code will be sent to you at xxxxxxxx106" jesus christ not again , thats the fraudsters number and he or she is still redirecting my data , the last straw .. i phone the helpline to speak once again to an advisor and now my mobile phone is unable to connect me to this number it rings\ntwice and disconnects , so now the fraudster has intercepted calls to paypal as he knows my nuber from my account. ive given up now i cant even get in to paypal to delete my account how stupid is that, help files say the way to deleted your account is\nfirst you log in to that account , what a bunch of morons paypal staff are, nearly three hours on the phone and i have to walk away because there is nobody that can fix this issue?
