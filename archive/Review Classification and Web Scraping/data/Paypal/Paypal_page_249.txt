The email stated I would be charged a $27.00 fee and I wanted to dispute this fee due to a banking error. When I spoke to a representative, I was told this returned payment was my bankâ€™s fault. I have serious doubts about this as USAA has never made mistakes regarding autopayments since I have been a member. After disconnecting with PayPalâ€™s service representative, I contact USAA. After reviewing my account, a second time with the banker we were unable to find any pending transactions or attempts from Paypal to take the $29.00 payment out of my account. Despite my other payment of $56.00 being taken out a few days prior. My USAA account is the only account I have been making payment from and I have not had issues with payments posting, until this time. I can provide bank statements showing I had enough funds in my account to cover the $29.00 on the date the original payment confirmation email was sent 11/27/2021. Which is a Saturday\n\nAfter speaking with USAA I was told the no payment from Paypal had been posted to my account pending or otherwise in the amount of $29.00 and the payment, if triggered Would not have gone through. Due to the Federal Reserve being closed, the earliest date the payment would have posted would be today 11/29/2021.\n\nI called PayPal back and they was told I would be charged a late fee, despite the error clearly being on their end. Iâ€™m done with you PayPal, I have the funds to pay balance in full and will be closing my account. Since USAA noted this I will pay the late fee and dispute the charge. USAA does a great job refunding my money. Has already made a note regarding the issue with PayPal.', 'review_date': '2021-11-29', 'review_time': '21:12:01', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
