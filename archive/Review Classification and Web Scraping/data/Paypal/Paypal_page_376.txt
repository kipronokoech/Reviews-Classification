Not one of you\'re gutless call center members would answer you are appalling and should all be fired.

I felt this has always been the safest way. I heard about the business side of it and thought I would give it a shot. I was so happy, why because I just started my business and felt that this would be the safest way to go, not only for myself but the customer. I did my first transaction and was so happy. The item went out first before tracking was uploaded on the receipt cause it was a family member. I called paypal and let them know. They said they would send an email for the customer to notify they received. DONE, did that. Soon after, I get an email "Before we can release your funds, you need to verify your business". I spent 1 hour on the phone, uploading docs, making sure they were received and they were. I then proceeded to do my second transaction. Shortly after, I was notified the money was on hold, then after that it was available. I then received 5 min later that paypal will not work with me because im a "potential risk" I was pissed.
