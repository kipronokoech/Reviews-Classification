Unfortunately, I will have to stop using them as they have stolen £420 from me and refuse to refund it even though I have the evidence to prove it.\nWith times being harder at the moment, I sold an item on eBay, and the amount £420 was credited to my PayPal account. They did not notify me of this. I then made an online purchase for £490. They removed my credited £420, but then charged me a full £490, thereby charging me twice. I have evidence proving all this, but they refuse to take the time to check records or make amends to return my own money back to me.

It essentially makes the app pointless, people want their money instantaneously, they don’t want to wait around for a month just because paypal is a bit suspicious as to where you’ve got the money from, and is it really ANY of their concern??? At a push i’d wait 3-5 days to receive money online, but a whole month is ridiculous. And can we talk about what the hell account limitations even are ? So you start up a paypal account, you sell something for what paypal considers too much money, so they block you from getting that money for no reason at all. Imagine withdrawing money from an atm and not being allowed because it just doesn’t want to give you the money. The sort of information they ask for to verify your account is utterly stupid, it might as well be asking me to provide a rock from the moon! They find it necessary to randomly block you from getting any money at all and for what exactly? what is the hype surrounding paypal about ? it’s a terrible, terrible app that allows for scammers to take a refund AND keep the item, siding with buyers, enabling funds for 2,000 years, and the audacity to tell you you’re fraudulent for having over £100.', 'review_date': '2021-02-23', 'review_time': '20:54:16', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
