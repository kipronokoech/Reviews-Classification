I jumped the gun and ordered two of them, but if I had taken my time I would have realized that something was fishy about it: Different logos, contact information with too many digits, scripts that say that 10 people are looking into the items, and the same items being recently sold. I used Paypal to make the sale, and the fact that the money was sent to a single individual made me suspicious. In any case, I received a text confirming the order, a link to my order on their website, and it stated that I would receive another text with a tracking number.\n\nWhen I looked up the order on their website a couple of days later, it now had a tracking number attached to it, which claimed that it was delivered to a different state and was sent out before I even placed my order. I contacted Paypal and e-mailed the seller through their website. I received a new tracking number shortly afterwards (not suspicious at all) and got a call from Paypal confirming it. Later that day, I received a message saying that my e-mail to the seller didn\'t go through because it wasn\'t a valid e-mail address. Nothing suspicious here, nope...\n\nSo I wait for my package and receive confirmation that it was delivered, but it\'s nowhere to be seen. The Ring cameras didn\'t pick up a delivery person or a potential thief. Contacting FedEx, I learned that the package was delivered to a completely different address in the same city, it had someone else\'s name on there, and after contacting the company who shipped the package, I learned that they had no affiliation whatsoever with the website I ordered from. My suspicion? The seller managed to obtain someone else\'s tracking number to the same area, and never shipped the items I ordered because they never had them.\n\nI complained to Paypal with this information, along with numerous screenshots of the website and whatever suspicious information I came across to make my case. My order on the website, the tracking number that indicated my shipment had been delivered to a different state from earlier, and the information I had obtained from FedEx. I was assured they would make things right and provide me with a refund, provided that my seller respond within ten days. If the seller did, I wasn\'t made aware of it, and my case was denied because the tracking information they were given confirmed that the package was still delivered. "Disgusted" would be the correct term. Oh, and the website I ordered from suddenly no longer exists. Gee, I wonder why.\n\nAfter complaining to Paypal, they asked that I provide an intranet form (proof of delivery) from FedEx to confirm my suspicions and reopen the case. It took a while, but FedEx provided me with the document I needed, with proof that the package came from a different company, went to a completely different person at a completely different address. They were hesitant but after hearing me out, the people at FedEx really wanted to help me. Despite being told once again by Paypal not to worry about anything and they\'d take care of it, my case was swiftly denied again for the same reasons as earlier, despite providing them with AN OFFICIAL DOCUMENT from FedEx confirming that the items were never delivered to me.\n\nEDIT: After complaining to them about being denied a second time, another representative looked into the case and quickly informed me that I\'ll be given a refund. While I\'m glad that someone finally had the sense to do it, this should have been the outcome the first time around. If they feel that I didn\'t provide enough proof, they should have asked for more before denying my claim the first time. I\'m relieved that I\'ll be given a refund but it was just painful.\n\nKeeping the low review because the experience was terrible.
