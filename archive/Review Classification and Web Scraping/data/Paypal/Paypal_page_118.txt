It is not similar to Skrill and others, less expansive, which started as a helpful start-up. Then grew up being sold to people who act like they are living in their Universe. And then they stopped caring for their Customers. You forget such Companies and move to alternatives.\nYou can\'t act like that with Paypal. You can not bypass them if you are not influential enough. So with Paypal, I remember worse times and tried to use alternatives, then they called me themselves and offered the best possible conditions. I start using them again. These times Pay Pal stepped in a low crest of a wave. It happens, I think because they try to create Orwell\'s 1984 for their users. I don\'t know if they are under some pressure or if it\'s their idea - but with that pressure and limitations, I won\'t be surprised that more and more people will become libertarians, even those, like me, who didn\'t care "about the glass" ever before.\nCurrently, I can not pay with my money from my bank account, as they have a glitch not allowing me to do that. "For security reasons," I can spend my 25K credit card without any problem and withdraw any money FROM the Paypal account. But have a problem returning this money to Paypal or sending it back TO Paypal. The ideal situation is if I was a fraudster, but I care about my credit score. :-)\nAfter 7+ hours on the phone with support and two months of regular calls, some supervisors told me that because I use VPN, I am blocked.

To my question why this rule exists, Paypal employee informed that they need to control our location, the device and all data related to us.
