When I filed a claim with PayPal, the company gave them a tracking number that showed delivered. So PayPal closed in their favor. Without letting me send them copies of the email communication between me and this company, proving it had been sent to a wrong address!! The company, 3 weeks ago, said they’d send me a replacement. Sent me a new tracking number that I was able to track, then suddenly the overseas tracking company disappeared online. I contacted the company again, and they asked if I’d like a refund, in which I said yes, please. They said “ok”, literally, just an email response of “ok”, and I’ve not heard from them since, haven’t received my equipment, NOR my refund.
