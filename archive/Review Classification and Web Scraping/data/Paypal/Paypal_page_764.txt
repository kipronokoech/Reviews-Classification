Ebay is riddled with buyers who take money and never send their items as well as customers who pretend they dont recieve their items despite the fact they have, these two types of people will always exist on ebay and one would think that paypal joing up with ebay would minimise the risks...but it has done the opposite, people will now happily abuse the paypal protection policy hence the huge surge of negative reviews. I like so many others sold an expensive item on ebay for local pickup, the buyer asked if I\'d prefer cash or card and I said card because that way he could send me over the money beforehand and meet me to pick up the item. Instead Paypal told me i have to wait 28 days for the funds to be released. I quickly messaged the buyer asking him to confirm he recieved the item online as well as leaving a positive review but even after that the funds would not be released. It annoyed me because despite me and the buyer fully knowing what went down, it was this annoyingly paranoid and unneccesary middle man (that\'s paypal for you slow ones) that was keeping me from having my money.\n\nHere\'s the funny part, read any complaint on this site and paypal will have a completely legal reason to back up any action they did. Paypal knew that nobody can read 50 pages of fine print so they got away with it.\n\nThe sketchy part - Apparently paypal may be telling a few white lies but the biggest one is probably "when we hold your money it doesn\'t go anywhere we just freeze it". When paypal hold your money they have to put it somewhere. Imagine paypal did actually have a bank account where they hold all their money from these witheld fund fiascos. That bank account would be seeing several thousands of pounds flooding into it at a constant rate, that garners a lot of interest, now the question is where is that interest going, and if paypal have a hold on your money who\'s to say they don\'t lend it to the banks so that there is an even level of commerce between branches, that in itself is an incredibly lucrative business and it\'s what banks do anyway and at this point paypal might as well be a bloody bank as opposed to this weird hip and cool money transfer thing.', 'review_date': '2019-02-14', 'review_time': '23:48:30', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

Paypal is a HORRIBLE payment platform from a business/sellers perspective. 1. There customer service is the worst I have ever experienced in my life including dining at restaurants, the reps are from non-english speaking countries who have access to your private information and read off Que cards only repeating they are doing what they do for your protection. 2. EVERY sell I do whether its $2 or $200 gets placed on hold for 3-4 weeks! So not only have you already shipped the item, but even though you charge the customer shipping you have to pay shipping out of pocket and after you no longer have the item and have paid out of pocket for a buyer to receive the item, now you have to cross your fingers in hopes that the buyer doesnt decide to rip you off and say they never received the item because if they do paypal will never release funds and even refund to buyer. Oh and by the way while all this is going on paypal takes there cut/fee out of the held funds you dont have access to. I'm sorry but if you start up a business now and you choose to do business with paypal who has over 100,000 complaints with consumer affairs and bbb then you shouldnt be operating a business. NO other business is ran the way paypal operates other that are own governtment. Taking business owners hard earned money causing numerous operating issues without apologies and telling you if you dont like it you should go find another payment platform to use.....yes, this was said to me by a paypal rep over this past Christmas holiday when I called to ask when a payment would be released.
