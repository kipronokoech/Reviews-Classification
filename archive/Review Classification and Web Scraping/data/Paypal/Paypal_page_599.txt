I complained to PayPal and asked them to investigate the company I did business with. Their response was to close my complaint and stated they did so because I had received my package along with a tracking number from the seller, even though I had explained I spent money for a product I did NOT receive. PayPal is okay with merchants ripping people off and still allowing them to operate business under PayPal. Buyer beware!

Limitation put in my new account. Completely understandable, PAYPAL have to monitor new accounts, money laundering etc. Let’s put this into perspective, this is £170 that was earned selling used goods on eBay, the goods were dispatched on the same day of purchase and were with the customers in 2 days, positive feedback received and EBAY released the funds. Paypal asked me to provide a lot of information including ID which I have done. Told 72 hours turnaround to check info, messaged 4 days later, have to wait an additional 5 days. COVID was the reason used for the delay which I find insulting as I think this is being used as an excuse for PAYPALS poor service (all the users on Trustpilot cant be wrong). This situation leads me to wonder that if PAYPAL had to wait for their fees until they had done their job, would I be waiting this long? I don’t think so. Advice to others, don’t use EBAY as you will have to use PAYPAL and then they will hold your money until they can be bothered to do what they have to do. Use another platform and ensure your money is yours from the time the goods are delivered.', 'review_date': '2020-05-18', 'review_time': '10:07:30', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
