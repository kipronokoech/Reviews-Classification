I contacted support via web chat and then the person expected me to first set up another Paypal account and then start a case on that account stating my other account was not accessible. I said I wasn't prepared to do that so they then said I needed to call a 'pay for' number and I said I'm not paying for something that is their fault, so I would charge them for it. He then said he or someone would call me the next day but couldn't do it this evening because their phones aren't usable after a certain time. When I received a phone call the next day I then had to go through a ridiculous authentication procedure that forced me to give consent for them to do a credit search and give over another phone number. When he asked for my consent I said I didn't have much choice and he laughed. Then after I followed a few instructions the login still wouldn't work and we had do do a few more things, twice over, before it worked.\nI also have a case open with them due to an overcharge for a UPS delivery.

This is easy to understand that a transaction cannot just have money added on to it so is obviously something I need refunding for. Their first response was that it wasn't a billing dispute and the second was that 'the label wasn't used' which shows they just don't understand this simple issue. How on earth they are able to allow a transaction be for one amount but the total be a different amount is worrying and is possible an indication their business accounts are not actually correct if an error like this can happen.\n\nEdit: Paypal have closed the case stating the postage label was unused.\nBut the postage label was used, so they are clearly not bright enough to see the problem.", 'review_date': '2020-10-26', 'review_time': '17:11:17', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
