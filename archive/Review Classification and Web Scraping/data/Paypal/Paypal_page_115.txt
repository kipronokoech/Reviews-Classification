I've maily used my account to pay for online purchases with 0 problems until Saturday 14 January when late in the evening my account was hacked and an unauthorised purchase from Hong Kong was made totling upto ¬£587.99. Literally a minute after the fraudulent transaction had taken place, the fraudsters closed my account which should have triggered 2 factor authentication but it didn't. Naturally, all my links to Ebay and other companies were broken so I received a few Paypal official legit emails confirming this. As my account was closed, I have no way of filing a complaint/dispute and after recreating my account on the 15th to see what would happen, none of my transactions are linked to Paypal its a good thing I'm in the habbit of filing all my transactions through Paypal. I tried phoning Paypal but keep on going round and around on an automated system loop so have given up. I contacted my bank who instantly locked my account, canceled my card and are claiming the funds back from Paypal/ADSR Limited in Hong Kong. Others reading this review please be aware I'm very security concious so have very complex passwords using binary numbers, random words and characters all over 15 characters in length so I don't understand why 2 factor authentication wasn't triggered in this situation as even sometimes small Deliveroo payments have triggered it on my devices so please please please be very careful if using Paypal. I'm just releived my bank were sympathetic and could see on my account this was a random fraudulent transaction as they asked me if I'd ever heard of ADSR Limited, where they were based and what business they were involved in. I'm just glad in my case the bank probably has Paypal contacts higher up the chain of command so can bang heads together but after this, I'm never ever using Paypal and will recommend others not to do the same unless concrete steps are taken especially in cases like mine. I should make it clear I've scanned all of my devices from malware and everything is fully in the clear. None of my router logs show any hack from my end so its either been hacked at Paypals end or I've been randomly targeted but I'm glad in my case I'll get a new card and the funds will be back in my account shortly so everyone please beware and take care. I should also mention yes I have emailed the Paypal phishing team with only an automated reply and I did send them the flurry of official Paypal emails I received late on the 14th.", 'review_date': '2023-01-18', 'review_time': '10:14:04', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
