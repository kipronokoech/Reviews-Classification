I would like to share my two cents and offer some tips from what helped me. I’ve dealt with good customer service reps, and not so good. I do feel like the customer service reps were a bit better years ago but- alas they probably also deal with millions of more difficult people a day!\n\nMy issue was I could not verify my bank account and it simply would not work while trying to input it 3 times. I called once- was put on hold for 30 minutes to speak to an account specialist, sent a message via the app and it wasn’t resolved, and then called again and spoke to someone SO kind (Tanya) and he linked my same bank account back up in 6 minutes!\n\n1) I think the better time to call is later in the day- it’s Pacific time so these people are working at 6 and dealing with many rude people. Not saying this is an excuse but if they sound say, apathetic, this very well could be an indicator\n\n2) be nice! Yelling or getting frustrated at a customer service rep doesn’t help them help you nor does it help them grasp the whole situation. They did not cause the problem. They’re just trying to do their job- and as humans we work harder when people are grateful.\n\n3) PayPal has had lawsuits and security breaches especially an incline in the past 5 years. This is why there are security precautions. This is why they tried to protect my bank account. This is why your account very well may be frozen. Fraud is real, and it’s November 20th but they helped my situation in do time. Customer service could always Improve not matter the industry.\n\nBUT if you are unhappy with your rep simply say thank you, hang up, breathe and try again.

This is an absolutely ridiculous business practice.\nSecond, good luck trying to add a bank account. Used to be a breeze, now they have you first confirm that it is you (because I guess it's no longer good enough to be logged into your account on a recognized device) and the only way to do this is by them sending your phone a code but the thing is, if you don't get the code within ten minutes it expires. To top it off, if you try to resend the code multiple times because you didn't receive the first one (or two, or three), they lock you out of your account for 24 hours and there's no way to reset it.
