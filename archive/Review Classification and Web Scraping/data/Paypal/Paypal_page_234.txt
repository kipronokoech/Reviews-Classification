By the time I get here I have exhausted every attempt to get an entity to assist the customer or change their ways for the better. PayPal if you do not agree to couples counseling we are over.\nHorror of all horrors.. opening yourself up to ID theft on a public wireless svc. I have been SO careful over the years.. never ever have I opened PayPal on WIFI that left me naked.. except this time. In a hotel I had been staying in for weeks on a job, I opened my online water bill. IT WAS LATE. crap i opened PayPal and sent.. oh crap i didn\'t you are saying. Oh yes and that was the beginning of the crash. three days later my bank called. have you done this, this, or this. they knew I was out of town but in Chicago.. I was near Montgomery AL. before freezing everything, and I do mean everything tied to my PayPal I authorized a cash withdrawal to be picked up and put on a chime. That thing stays locked as angels in Hades. Then the bank locked it all as I researched the hole. Someone apparently not only got in my account when I was in it.. they were able to keep it OPEN after I logged out. there was no direct access to any cards or my bank but the leak was bad enough. I contacted the bank so they knew to kill all cards and issue new ones.. THEN it was time to dance with the devil. PayPal dug their heels in from the get go. Blaming me, a customer in good standing for... as long as there was a PayPal. Anyway email after email refusing. yes REFUSING to look into it further they closed all of my complaints saying I was online and I authorized the purchases. HrMmm? Ok in typical Virgo fashion I went ballistic. Never lie to or about one of us if anyone is to survive.. just in case some of you out there have little experience in dealing with a Virgo mind. Immediately I went from secure the accounts to reject charges. PayPal did NOT like that and started what was borderline threats. I had stripped my PayPal business account of all information could. Everything went and was replaced with old phone numbers and addresses. Now here is where you asked what was the result of my overreaction with my financial institutions. Every SINGLE one of them sided with the consumer vs PayPal. Recently I discovered a long ago and long is like 200 plus days ago order I never received. Again in concise "it\'s all the customer\'s fault" business style that we call Pay\'PAL\' they admonished me in a very nasty i should have done something before the 180 days expired at this point i am not worried about money it\'s gone Karma will have it\'s day.. All i wanted was a nice congenial John Doe we are sorry you have had troubles please tell us more. It may be past the time cut off but at least we can look into the seller and if they are still using PayPal we will keep watch for other complaints... THAT would have been nice. I have had great business with PayPal do not get me wrong but that was at times when I did not need them. Times when business went smoothly and now with Covid still hanging like a smoker\'s cough.. cone men are running wilder than ever after money. Someone in this (business) relationship needs to learn to communicate.. and all of you reading this knows who the over communicator is by now. And I KNOW PayPal will kill this review which is why it was copied and emailed to a couple other reliable sources for them to post on the outside where PayPal is not their own god. Buyer beware, those looking for credit cards beware. Treat this thing like the soon to be ex cheating on you with your boyfriend. never take your eyes off your activity and be ready to jump when you see something suspicious.', 'review_date': '2022-01-22', 'review_time': '05:04:39', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
