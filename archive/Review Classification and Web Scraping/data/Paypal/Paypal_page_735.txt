A few years ago i had a really successful business running on ebay selling on clothes etc but of course you get the odd person who takes advantage of your good nature and decides to claim they never received an item. This then leads to cases being opened and money being held. However this led to paypal 'limiting' my account. I was given next to no time to come up with all the proof they needed to make my account normal again and this included the following 'tracking for all items sent ever' (an actual big company would not even have this as archiving takes place every 1 - 5 years). I also had to supply invoices for everything i've sold. How the hell am i supposed to supply an invoice to a dress i owned when i was 15? Proof of idendity etc. I think i've established there that this was all bullcrap and therefore because i could provide the unneccessary paperwork they desired my account was forever limited and my money put on hold for 6 months. I eventually got this back after the 6 month hold was off but could no longer use my account which would stay open for the next 10 years for data purposes. This was the issue i had then for every single paypal account i opened as they linked them all back to my original account therefore i have not been able to pick up my business again on any online platform as all require paypal as a form of payment as it's 'safe'. yeah for buyers cause they can scam you. This company will also claim to be a bank but they are not, if they were they would be a fully regulated company with the FCA and they are not. There is no signs on any of their websites that they are part of the Financial Conduct Authority. You cannot send your disputes to the Fianancial Ombudsman either so don't let them fool you with that nonsense. My best advice is stay away, use gumtree or shpock to sell things online that way it's cash in hand. Don't let youself get into debt or problems cause paypal are holding money for 'security purposes'.

I have been using paypal for years, my debit card and bank account have been verified through them for years as well. Enter in my most recent sale through ebay. The sale was normal, the payment went through ok, but when i went to make an online purchase the next morning, It told me that my account balance was not available (at the window that pops up when you click "pay now with paypal"), and it had tried to charge my debit card (which was empty. the balance was in paypal). And when i checked, i was told after much runaround, that there were new verification requirements to keep cash in paypal. So I completed those. When i returned to the website to make the purchase again, instead of being sent to a purchase summary with options to pay, I was sent to my main account summary on the paypal website. I tried three different shopping sites, and two different browsers. same issue ( I STILL cannot make online purchases) and after spending 30 minutes on hold, and being hung up on once in the chat window, because the person was trying to get me to sign up for something that would allow me to make offline payments. (he said i HAD TO sign up for this but when i told him that i had my debit card for offline purchases, he closed his side of the window without saying anything more ).. the second person told me that it was simply my browser timing out and that was why i did not see anything in the window. (Not listening AGAIN) when i explained to them it was not timing out, and i had tried different browsers, and different websites, I was told it was ME not doing something right, and that if i needed to make an immediate purchase I should just transfer my balance to my debit card, sine they offer an "instant" transfer that should be complete in a few minutes. ( I assume so he did not have to do any actual work, because he did not know what to do to fix my account)what he did NOT tell me, was that somehow the verification on my debit card had disappeared, and that according to paypal, my debit card nor my bank account had ever been verified. because of this, my money was placed on an investigative hold, and I was prevented from accessing my money for 24-36 hours. This is the complete OPPOSITE of what i was trying to do! and the "instant" bank transfer COSTS 1% of the amount of money you are sending!If i had been able to wait, I would just have used the typical bank transfer, that takes a couple of days, and costs much less. a flat 1.50. So I am still waiting for my money, and I still cannot make online purchases AT ALL through paypal. whenever i try, it sends me to an account summary page. Paypal keeps telling me that my browser is timing out... even though it is not, I am being routed to the wrong site. I have been dealing with this issue for two days now, and this has caused serious harm to my business. I work with plants for a living, and as anyone who even owns a single houseplant knows, a day without something it needs (such as water, or light) can cause the death of the plant. I needed to make this purchase YESTERDAY, in the morning, so that my purchase would arrive first thing friday. Now because of this horrid ordeal, I need to wait 3-5 business days for my debit card to be re-verified, and to do that they take money out of your bank account through your debit card and hold it until you give them the special code. Which means I wont get my purchase until some time next weekEND, and some of my plants are certainly going to die. I have lost out on hundreds of dollars in sales because of this as well, because i cannot complete online transactions, and i must tell my customers not to make paypal purchases, because i do not know whether or not i will be able to get my money from the site. When all the paypal employee had to do was a little bit of research into why i am being routed to my account summary when i should be given payment options for my purchase. If it were one site, it would be different. but it is every site i try, on every browser i try, on every device i try. so it is not the other websites, or my computer, or my bank. STAY FAR AWAY FROM PAYPAL! I am glad at least that this happened before i opened up my business account. I was going to do that this week. If they do this to a long time civilian customer, what ab out a new business account? what sort of issues will IT have?

At first, there was no any issues about all my transactions. Receiving and sending money all were smooth. I also sent my money 3 times to my local bank without any problem. Status completed in 1-2 hours after i sent my money (fyi, "completed" means they already sent our money to our bank, and then it will need around 2-4 days for BANKING transaction time). But then after that they gave me lots of troubles. They blocked my transaction system without any reason. I couldn\'t send my money for around 6-7 days, and during that time i called them for many times through emails and phones (international roaming). They had non sense excusements about it. They were affraid it was scammer who used my account because i used my paypal\'s account more often than before (based on our conversation by phone). That was the main reason why they blocked my transaction system. Logically, after they know it was me who used my account, they should unblocked me in a sec, right? Tragically, they didn\'t do that and my transaction system was still blocked. Also fyi, during that time they also "HOLD" my receiving payment, but i understood about this point, my client sent money with "good" as transaction, so my client needed to confirm the transaction before paypal unhold my money. And for this case, its already done after my client declared the transaction as a LEGAL transaction, not fraud transaction or something like that. Make sense. So back to topic about my blocked transaction system, LOGICALLY, there was no any excusement anymore for them keep blocking my transaction system. First, they already know it was me who used my account, not scammer. Second, it was LEGAL transaction as my client declare. But "paypal is paypal", after i read many threads about their non-sense and their worst service, and (TOO SAD) there are many people around the world whose having same problem as me, i just can say PLEASE googling about their service before you decide to use Paypal for your overseas or business transaction. You will find BUNCHES of complaints about their services. Now (since 54 hours ago) i can send my money after i told them "what you did is against law". All my problems are already fixed now? NOPE. I transferred all my money 54 HOURS AGO but its still in PENDING status until now. "Pending" means they HAVEN\'T transfer my money YET to my local bank (based on our conversation today by phone and email), and as always its for their another BLAH BLAH aka NON-SENSE excusement. But their reason is they need another 72 hours (3 days) for monitoring my transaction. Monitoring? Seriously? For what reason? After 3 days they will transfer my money, then i will need another 2-4 WORKING days for banking transaction time. So the CONCLUSION is i need 6-7 days their blocked system + 3 days their "monitoring" system + 2-4 WORKING days banking transaction time + 2 DAYS for weekend (Saturday and Sunday are not banking working days) aka i need 13-16 DAYS FOR GETTING MY OWN MONEY. And i\'m pretty sure it would need more longer time IF i didn\'t follow them up for everyday. In the end, i don\'t recommend Paypal for your overseas or business transaction. They will kill your transaction cashflow sooner or later. They will also kill your client\'s trust just in case you need that money for paying your clients, or maybe you need that money for paying your employee\'s salary. Or maybe you need that money for any urgent transaction? Right? But decission is in your hand. Just saying my experience about Paypal and i will totally close my account after they send all MY MONEY to my local bank.
