Also that, sometimes, errors may occur and they close your account, and it won't matter how much money you have, they'll hold it for even months. Furthermore, they have the WORST contact support, they don't even give you answers when you have a problem, they won't care if that problem causes you to lose your own money, they just wanna steal it, such an incompetent company, I'll never use it again.", 'review_date': '2021-04-01', 'review_time': '00:47:41', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
