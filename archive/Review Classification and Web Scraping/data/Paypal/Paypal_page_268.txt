For the first time in forever I got conned online by a fraudulent seller. A trivial amount of money - but these things are about the principle.\nThis was not simply a matter of the goods not being received, it was clear that the seller was a con.\nI only transacted with the seller in the first place because as a merchant they accepted PayPal - I thought they must therefore be legit and of course, if something did go wrong, PayPal would have my back, right? Wrong! After using the PayPal dispute processes, the seller provided "compelling" and "valid" evidence - PayPal\'s words.\nValid: the FedEx tracking number is a valid FedEx tracking number\nCompelling: the only detail for the delivery address supplied by FedEx, East Sussex (the county), matches the county of my address.\nTherefore PayPal closed the dispute, rule in favour of the seller and I can\'t reopen or raise a new dispute.\nSeveral calls to PayPal and they stick to the script and advise me that it is for me to work with FedEx to prove the parcel was not delivered to my address - so the PayPal process is that the buyer has to fish for evidence in great detail than the seller - absurd.\nI did one better, using the power of google, I searched the name of the person who signed for "my" package and county. I cold called the match, spoke to him and got him to email me that it was his parcel (an electronic hardware store in another town). I sent this on to PayPal who refused to accept it.\nI will never use PayPal again and neither should you. They are complicit in and facilitate online fraud. Their dispute procedure is bias towards the seller who can, like in my case, easily provide minimal "valid" and "compelling" evidence for rule in their favour.', 'review_date': '2021-10-09', 'review_time': '12:13:11', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
