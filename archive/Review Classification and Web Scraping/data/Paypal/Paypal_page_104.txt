Within 1 minute I was speaking to a rep. I have needed to make 4 additional calls and every time I say no and get a rep within a couple minutes. Sadly the reps are all incompetent. So to the actual problem\n\nAfter PayPal couldn't help me I went to my bank about the same issue. I had to report the transaction as a unapproved transaction (which it technically was).\nPayPal, who didn't really take interest in the issue before suddenly became quite concerned they separated all my payment options from their system. They also called me (which I was 1/2 sure was a scam because it was an robocall) to tell me this.\nI have to take 4 steps to reconnect my accounts. I have tried two of them twice and gotten no results.\n\nI wouldn't care as PayPal is a service I would never use again at this point, but I have PayPal credit which I must pay off. Which I can't pay off until they let me reconnect my accounts.\nThey have made it clear I will be fined and charged interest and the debt will be sent to collections if I don't pay.\n\nThis is one of the most predatory practices I have ever seen.", 'review_date': '2023-02-10', 'review_time': '17:09:35', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
