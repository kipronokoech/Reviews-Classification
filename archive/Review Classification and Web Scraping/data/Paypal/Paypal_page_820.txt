The issue they seem to have is that the different departments do not communicate very well at all. You can call up one week and speak to department A, they say they will try to fix a problem. You call again the next week and are transferred to department B who don't know your issue and can't get information from the first department, so you have to restart the process all over again.\nPersonally, I look forward to when eBay moves from Paypal as their main payment option so that we can start using other payment providers because we can't possibly have more issues with another company than we have here.", 'review_date': '2018-03-05', 'review_time': '11:42:17', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

Their business idea is to take your money and never give it back, or if they do, take a huge slice of it.

It takes weeks, and during the process, they can\'t tell you anything. Finally once it\'s all done, and you are "verified", if you try and pull out the money in one hit, you\'re back to square one: "Suspicious activity". You end up with customer service and they tell you to take the money out in smaller amounts. Remember this is YOUR money. Like going to the back and they tell you you can\'t withdraw from your own bank account.\n\nThey offer a "Buyer Protection" but it\'s also rigged. You need to open a case, then you need to wait for the seller to respond. But if the seller never responds, then you need to escalate the case within a certain time window - not too soon, not too late - or else they close the case, and YOU CAN NEVER RE-OPEN IT! That\'s right, if you don\'t escalate the case within the specified time period, it gets closed, and you cannot re-open it or start a new case, you will never be able to get your money back.\n\nIt all fits a pattern of a company that does everything they can to take your money and then does everything they can to avoid paying it back.
