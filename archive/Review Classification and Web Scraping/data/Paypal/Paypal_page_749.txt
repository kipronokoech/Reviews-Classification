I raised this with both Megadeals and Paypal. Paypal said they would investigate, ask the vendor for their side, let me know what the vendor said, and then make a decision. However, they have not let me know what Megadeals said, they have just told me they have decided in favour of the merchant. I have exchanged numerous emails with Paypal and they still haven't told me what Megadeals said. I said I wasn't happy and wanted to take it further and they told me (by email) how to raise an appeal. However, the instructions they gave did not allow me to appeal on the case, so I raised the whole thing again. After that, they sent me messages saying my account appeared to have been hacked and I had to change password and send a copy of my passport. Useless.

Upon the last call I informed the rep -- who like the other reps I had talked to previously was quite rude -- that I would discontinue the use of PP services if the problem continued. This morning the problem occurred again. And just because of two posts on their PP Facebook page about the issue -- I was rebuffed by a PP moderator.\n\nSo PayPal -- you want it -- you got it.
