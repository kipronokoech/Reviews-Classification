I think PayPal hates MMO (make money online) products and services because of how many refunds are associated with that. If you get enough refunds then you're going to have issues but if you sell products that are non refundable (AKA music) or very low refund rate you shouldn't have any issues. If you get a lot of refunds in the first place then your product is probably just trash and you should reconsider what you're selling online. But so far (again, knock on wood) no issues with PayPal. It's easy to cancel recurring payments, submit claims, and withdrawals are easy enough and quick right to my bank. The one thing I could complain about is that customer support has gotten really bad. Super long wait times on the phone, but luckily I don't need ever need to call in to support. Anyways, must be something else the users are doing on their end.
