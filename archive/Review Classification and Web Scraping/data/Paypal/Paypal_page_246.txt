And trust me, sooner or later there will be costs.', 'message': 'I have no idea how PayPal got into the state it‚Äôs currently in, it used to be great. Unfortunately the last few years of my experience with them has been absolutely awful. I‚Äôve just closed my account with them.\n\n‚Ä¢Denied me access to my own money, never gave a valid reason. For so many of my transactions they unnecessarily held my money for ‚Äúsecurity reasons‚Äù and offered zero support as to why or how I could fix it. Never hold a large sum of money here if you plan on doing anything like supporting family, paying bills or saving. Because when it comes to finally accessing it, they won‚Äôt let you. But they‚Äôll never l really be clear on why. I missed 3 bills and was unable to support my family over Christmas due to them holding my money for almost a month.\n\n‚Ä¢Shockingly bad, inconsistent and unhelpful customer support-\nRelating to the issues previously mentioned; the customer support blatantly attempt to cut conversations short and get you off their back, rather than do anything to help. They‚Äôll throw out the same generic support script, even if it isn‚Äôt relevant to your issue. If you try to follow it up by explaining your issue further, well too late. They‚Äôll have already closed the chat by then, whether they‚Äôve helped or not. From here you‚Äôre forced to open another support chat, which will either send you In circles with the same useless script, or say something contradictory to what the previous agent said. While holding ¬£300 of my money, I spent 3 weeks and went through roughly 40 different customer support staff - all of which failed to do anything to help.\n\n‚Ä¢Zero support for scams. I consider myself quite aware and vigilant with scams, I know how to avoid them. Unfortunately, the one and only time I fell victim to one was partly the fault of PayPal. Scammer opened a claim on there saying they never received their purchase from me. Despite having evidence every step of the way to prove this wasn‚Äôt the case, they ruled in the scammers favour no questions asked. They took their claim at face value, quietly took my money and returned it to them.\n\n\nI don‚Äôt know what happened to PayPal or how it happened. But their businesses practices these days are suspicious, financially damaging, unsupportive and unhelpful. They don‚Äôt care about you as a customer, despite the amount of ‚Äúwe care‚Äù or ‚Äúwe value you‚Äù lines they drop in their scripts, they very clearly show they they don‚Äôt care in the slightest about their users.\n\nI now, just today have got all my money back from PayPal and closed my account immediately after. If you‚Äôre an existing customer, I suggest you do the same. If you‚Äôre a potential new customer, save yourself the trouble and avoid them at all costs.
