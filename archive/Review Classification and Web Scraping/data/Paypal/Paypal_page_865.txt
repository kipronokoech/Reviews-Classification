From time to time we get claims for unauthorised payments from people that want to get their money back after they received the top-up. It doesn't matter how many evidences you have, Paypal will allways side the scammers and give them money back. It's a scammer paradise out there and Paypal is pickpocketing honest merchants along with criminals.\nMy advice, switch to Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, chargeback rate is ZERO and there are almost no costs. I can't wait for the day when Bitcoin will be so popular that Paypal will have no customers anymore! It is not worth to deal with all the troubles that comes with Paypal. Horrible experiences, horrible staff, extremely high fees, extreme bad currency conversion rate and no help when you need it. Stay away if you can. Do not trust what they claim, even as a buyer you're not protected, scammers will always win and Paypal will take your hard earned money away.
