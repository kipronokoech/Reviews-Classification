We thought this was absurd to put it mildly how can there be a chargeback after 5 years when we never had issues in the 10+ years we used the account? We asked PayPal to agree to ADR (Alternative Dispute Resolution) they have ignored the request then when looking at the web we found a Private Investigation agency is looking into PayPal the posting on the invetigators site said "PayPal in Canada Breaching their own terms and conditions relating to alternative dispute resolution" we spoke to them and they suggested writing to PayPal in Toronto so we sent a letter with signature on delivery but have heard nothing.

{'platform': 'Paypal', 'id': '652c1f3092e7899b3773cc9e', 'stars': 1, 'title': 'Probably the Worst Payment Processor in the World', 'message': 'A couple of emotions becomes obvious whenever a site says something like "we use Paypal for payments," when attempting to complete a purchase using Paypal. Hint: It\'s a combination of anxiety, anger and sadness. Call it a cocktail. Add ice and it\'d be called "oh s***, it\'s Paypal on rocks."\n\nPaypal is hopeless and irritating. Every single time you need to bother with the payment processor there are so many problems. Depending on the scenario I\'ve had problems completing purchases without creating an account. After going back on creating an account one time, the service appeared to block my payment method.\n\nThen, what happens after when seeking help with customer service to \'unblock\' a payment method? You need to create an account. Why is that even necessary? Some sort of data protection guarantee, or to make sure they can more thoroughly exploit individuals like lots of banks, card companies and market research companies that sell or analyse data from purchases to fund their miserable existences. Going with the latter.\n\nSo, my only payment method is completely blocked from making purchases because of that attempted payment quite some time ago and I loathe creating accounts with companies for the reasons outlined above. Once a company has your money and details, you can guarantee another 50 - 300 will, at some point, acquire them (as long as they\'re partners of the company). Large companies have many, hence the problem.\n\nWhat infuriates me with Paypal is they seem obsessed with wanting you to create that blasted account. For example, when using their processor, by default it will have an option already ticked to create a Paypal account. You need to deselect this stupid thing every time.\n\nPaypal should have this deselected by default and need to allow customer service queries to go through without needing a bleeping account. There is absolutely no way in hell I will ever create one and nor should anyone else.\n\nPrivacy advocates, especially, will not tolerate this gibberish - and most of the time, these irritating bounced payments happen because people such as they are using privacy-retaining technologies. That is not illegal or particularly suspicious behaviour.\n\nEdit: I discovered yesterday evening that their site actually allows you to contact them as a \'guest\'; however, their chat option only allows people with accounts; this option was not here when I had the initial problem several months ago. Surprise, surprise. However again, you can actually phone them. But..... There is a constant busy signal. Shows how useless they are.\n\nEdit: Paypal\'s data retention period is 10 years minimum, with the option to increase it for legal reasons. That is rather hefty, since the generic period is 6. I personally find creating accounts a trap for the reason of giving this company data. Even if you\'re able to submit a data deletion request, legally-speaking, I really ponder if that somehow prevents their partners from acquiring and doing whatever they want with that data. Something tells me the data will be automatically transferred over to their partners upon signing up, but even if it takes longer, there will likely be a 28 day window - say the time it takes for the data deletion to be completed - for them to transfer the data to their partners. Plenty of time to transfer it to data brokers and similar evil b******s.\n\nEdit: I\'ve since called several times (they actually added a number to their site that works...) and gotten nowhere. Every time I request my payment method be unblocked, they mention either creating an account, using a different store, or a different payment method. Without an account, it\'s impossible to get the restriction of payments uplifted regardless of whether I used a \'guest payment.\' They cannot do anything without ID, and an account is needed for transferring ID over. Why? Because their service at paypal dot com email account cannot receive emails from people; however, they can bemusingly email you... Are they emailing as some sort of joke, or are they aware of how silly they look as a company? So, you phone because of this, go in a merry-go-round, waste your time and then rinse and repeat. Madness.\n\nBeyond annoying and irritating. Again, a company obsessed by user accounts and data. One can assume the reason is simply because it\'s plausibly one of their main revenue streams judging by how limited and downright broken other options are.\n\nEdit: Further calls have not helped (4) - it\'s like a stonewall. Anyway, I\'ve since attempted another payment using someone\'s card I had their permission to use & that payment method is also blocked! It\'s almost certainly from going back out of payments & attempting it again. I use add-ons that block javascript, so need to refresh to allow relevant domains to work.
