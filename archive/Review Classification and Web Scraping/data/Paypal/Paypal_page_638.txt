PayPal satisfies any buyers request for refund even if you responded for requests. In my situation PayPal just pretended that they didn’t receive my response and took money from my balance. I was try to use option which they call I WANT TO APPEAL PAYPAL DECISION, but I just waisted my time and nerve systems. PayPal took my money, buyer didn’t return my item, because according buyer’s information she called to PayPal Customer Service and someone said her that she can keep her purchase even she got refund. Unbelievable! So, if you are seller on eBay and have chance not use PayPal just don’t use it.
