I have been going back and forward regarding a dispute in which I was told by their own members of staff I had a really good/strong case yet they choose to close my case on 4 occasions for the same reason saying I had not provided them with the requested documents even though their own supervisors had confirmed they had received it whilst I was on the phone to them. I was sent products different to what was advertised and the products came damaged and came apart after 2 days. The seller blocked me from contacting them to get it resolved so I relied on PayPal to help me but became another victim to both the fake furniture company Ambassador Beds and PayPal. I only brought products from the furniture place as they used PayPal (which I thought was a trusted company) for a payment method. I have seen several other cases on Google reviews with this furniture place since I became a victim yet PayPal haven’t taken that into account or looked at the pictures I sent. I won’t be using PayPal to by products again!

Do not log into your bank account from paypal', 'message': 'I wanted to make a payment online to a merchant that I’ve never done business with before thus I wanted to conceal my banking info. I also had a balance with PayPal and wanted said balance to be used towards the purchase. I decided to use my bank account to add money to the balance I had with PayPal. PayPal presented two options to add funds from my bank account one of which it stated would take 3 - 6 days. I opted to log into my bank account via the option PayPal “boldly” presented as “immediate” to complete the transfer. I was then notified that the funds would not be reflected on PayPal until after 3 - 6 business days, so either way 3 - 6 days with my money being tied up.\n\nKnowing the funds were available and having promptly received the text notification from my bank re the transaction I know it was successful. I called PayPal’s customer service requesting that the transaction be canceled and my monies returned as I needed to pay the merchant that day and was told that they weren’t able to do so. I was told to wait the 6 days for the monies to be reflected on my balance with PayPal at which time I can transfer it back to my account and wait another 6 days for PayPal to credit my bank account. Let me not forget to mention that I had to jump thru hoops to find a number for customer service. I even wasted time talking to a “bot” (automated chat) system. Needless to say I’m out of that money for two (2) weeks and still had to find ways and means of paying the merchant. ***but here’s the kicker, the insult to the injury.\n\n***the following day (today) I received a notification from the bank with a 2FA code for access to my account. I wasn’t trying to login to my bank account so I was bewildered to say the least. It turns out after calling the bank and investigating it was PayPal and or the service that they use access people’s account trying once again access my bank account. I would not have picked up on this when I did had I not enabled “two form factor authentication“\n\nWhile in hindsight this was my error as i shouldn’t need to log into my bank account from PayPal to complete any transaction. While I’m willing to bet they have some fine print somewhere that makes this all legal, it was nothing short of deceptive and untrustworthy. Remember you don’t need to log into your account fr PayPal to complete any such transaction, the details on the bank card or the bank account details are more than sufficient.', 'review_date': '2022-03-17', 'review_time': '00:26:23', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
