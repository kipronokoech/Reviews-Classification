I had multiple unauthorised payments come out of my account from a scam website, supposedly as a "pre-approved" weekly subscription service. The website I received the service from cons people into buying a week of premium service and specifically states that after a week the account will be reverted to a non-premium (non paid) service. In reality once you sign up, money keeps coming out of your account and it is impossible to cancel this "subscription".\n\nThe site itself did not offer the option of cancelling this supposed "subscription" and when I contacted the site owner to ask for him to cancel and give me a refund, he refused even to cancel the subscription and told me paypal would have to deal with it. (Really???)\n\nIt was not possible to cancel in paypal as they did not offer this as an option, and the payment did not appear in the usual list of subscription services that can be cancelled such as Netflix etc. Meanwhile money was still coming out of my account on a weekly basis and paypal not answering my emails or calls due to coronavirus. It was impossible to speak to a human being. (they were, however, very quick decide to shut down the case I opened against the seller, despite coronavirus)\n\nPayPal is point blank refusing to refund any of the money.\n\nI even received daily reminder emails from the website stating "Your premium account on Mediafile Cloud is about to expire in 1 day(s). To avoid the account reverting to non-premium ensure you renew your premium membership." This is clearly misleading.\n\nTen years ago I was scammed on ebay. I bought a macbook pro on ebay and the seller never sent the item. When I reported it to paypal they refused to give me a refund and locked me out of my account.
