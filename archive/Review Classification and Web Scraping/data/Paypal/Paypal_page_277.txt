Called multiple times to their support over the phone, they would "dono-wall me" instantly saying that "PayPal reserves the right to keep information about Limitations confidential to safe keep their systems filters and avoid users bypassing them".

I had been using PayPal\'s services for about 8 years without a single issue besides maybe losing my debit card and having a little trouble getting a replacement ordered.\n\nThen all of a sudden one day it happened.... I got an email from them that said that they we\'re going to put permit restrictions on my account and start the process to close it and I would not be able to have an account with PayPal ever again. The reason was very big and it basically said... I had violated the terms of the user agreement.\n\nWhat whoa so I immediately went online and went to the website and tried to find the user agreement I did eventually find it. The agreement is about 25-30 pages long btw... I wonder how many people to open the account actually read the whole thing I\'m going to say 3% of the people do.\n\nI called the customer service department and was told that the internal security system software had found a violation in one of my transactions and it\'s all that the rep could tell me because they didn\'t have access to that information.\n\nSo I asked who does can I talk to them of course I couldn\'t talk to them because they didn\'t know who had access. Then they said "I don\'t think there is anybody that does..it\'s just a computer program" BS!\nI went back and reread the user agreement again that\'s what I figured out what happened. I had recently sold to Rockaway recycling converter that came off of a vehicle that I parted out and then sent to the scrap yard. Have this sale was 100% legal and legit and I have all the paperwork required to prove it. Rockwell recycling is a big national company and they actually advertise on the website when you sell them a kind of converter that you should use PayPal to get paid because it\'s faster and easier. Huh that\'s a conflict if I ever seen one.\n\nJust to clarify on the user agreement there is a section of about three to four sentences in there that basically says that buying or selling anything that is deemed as a high potential for fraud by a government agency you can\'t do with a PayPal account. Wait a second... they advertise using PayPal on their dang website. I was just doing what the company said was the best way to get paid.\n\nYou\'re the best part about it is in addition to closing my account PayPal put a freeze and hold on any funds I had for 180 days that\'s 6 months I couldn\'t touch my money! Which seems like an awful lot of time if they\'re supposedly worried about things coming back transactions are checks or something and they wanted the money in there in case they had to pay them 6 months it\'s not 1849 anymore 2021 doesn\'t take 6 months to do anything.\n\nAnyway after going back and forth multiple times talking to Rockaway recycling and PayPal, I still never had any luck getting somebody to explain to me what actually is going on.\n\nNeedless to say...at this point, I\'m done with PayPal, I really don\'t care if I have an account there.\nMost importantly, people need to know what\'s going on.\n\nIn my case.... after almost nine years without a problem...this happened. I started looking into their track record and customer complaints....PayPal\'s record is abysmal to put it lightly. I just wish they would have given me a chance to even explain. The bright lining is there\'s lots of other companies get off for the same services and their customer complaint track record are much better than PayPal\'s...so if you\'re thinking about getting a PayPal account...stop and think...about not doing it.', 'review_date': '2021-09-18', 'review_time': '14:40:36', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
