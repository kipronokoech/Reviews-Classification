It took a while and I had to file a complaint with BBB, but they finally took the right decision in favour of the customer (myself). It would have been a great or even excellent experience if I hadn´t wasted so much time and had to appeal to BBB. So, I still recommend they work on their customer experience and consider being on the side of the customer since the start.\n\nPaypal works great! Until you need to appeal a dishonest charge. The dispute system seems completely automated, impersonal and apparently always in favor of the seller. I have had a cancellation request for a subscription made through Paypal, initially contacting directly the seller and then Paypal. This was made before the subscription renewal date and even though I have the evidence, they seem oblivious to it. I will now seek legal action and everyone should do the same! They have serious customer service issues and should address these asap.', 'review_date': '2019-07-25', 'review_time': '22:22:41', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
