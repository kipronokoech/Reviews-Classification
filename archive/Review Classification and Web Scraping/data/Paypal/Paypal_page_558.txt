When I finely did reach someone online in Pay Pal's customer service and sent proof they refused to help me, so much for their useless guarantee policy!!\nPay Pal and Ebay have POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE and online contact information that doesn't work and no customer phone service that works or is listed.\nIt is now July 10, 2020 and still have not received my $159.93 even though I paid through Pay Pal to Ebay.\nI will NEVER deal with Pay Pal or Ebay again. They have no interest in helping their long term and loyal customers!! They make it very hard and almost impossible to contact them, hoping you will give up and they can keep your hard earned money.

First, the customer service is not only uninformed and confused about it\'s own product (I\'ve called many times...this is over multiple calls) and website. I am NEVER able to hear the customer service agents...the sound is always muffled or soft and I\'m relatively sure that the call center is not in a primarily english speaking place. The conversations are circular because the agent simply doesn\'t understand questions. Now for the website. Charges do not show up in a timely manner; you\'ll see a balance on your card but no corresponding charge until days later. I\'ve been told, "oh, it\'s just a glitch" or accusations that I don\'t know what I\'m doing. Today, when I complained to the agent that the charges were not showing before the increased balance he sent me to the automated survey recording. Also, the card charges foreign transaction fees so I\'ve never been able to travel with it. Every single time I have a problem with the card and have to call I feel sick to my stomach because I know i\'m not going to have a good experience. This lousy review is coming from a person who has an over 800 credit rating, always pays on time and manages all credit correctly. My other credit cards are so easy to use, the customer service is great and the websites and apps are simple to navigate. Unfortunately I understand that I shouldn\'t cancel the card because it might affect my credit rating, but I plan to cut it up and never bother with it again. Secure online transactions are available through Google Pay and a million other methods, so PayPal is no longer necessary. Don\'t even bother.
