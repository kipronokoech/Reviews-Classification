Initially, I encountered difficulties logging in and accessing my account due to SMS verification. At the time, I believed the issue was on PayPal's end. However, after engaging with several support agents via phone calls, it became apparent that the root cause was with my mobile provider. Unfortunately, their system was not reliably receiving automated PayPal messages, and the cause of this issue remains unknown.\n\nTo address this, I opted to switch to a new mobile number from a different network. The PayPal support team demonstrated professionalism and assisted me in smoothly updating both my personal and business accounts with the new number. I'm pleased to report that everything is now functioning as intended.\n\nConsidering this clarification, I am adjusting my review to 4 stars. While the main issue was not directly attributable to PayPal's platform, I recognize that there are still some existing issues and minor inconveniences that could be improved. The support agents' dedication to resolving the problem is commendable, and I acknowledge their efforts.", 'review_date': '2023-08-15', 'review_time': '14:14:08', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
