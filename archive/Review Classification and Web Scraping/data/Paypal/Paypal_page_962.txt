However with no mention on the package there is a true catch-22 they employ on new users.\n\nSo the rub? Once your "Greendot" funds are added to Paypal they are subject to different terms and conditions. Paypal then freezes said funds and insures that while in fact your funds are in your account you can\'t access said funds until you provide all of your financial and personal data to Paypal. I don\'t mind providing SOME info for tax reasons, etc.\n\nAll it takes is a single interception of private data to ruin your fun and in fact it\'s why I closed my Blizzard account and won\'t return due to serious concern about how Blizzard operates their website and account security.', 'review_date': '2011-05-31', 'review_time': '21:24:34', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

I was never informed of the lead time needed for payment to be processed. the paypal agent, told me to read the policy that courier serviced need to be used instead of collection in person. if so, why doesn't ebay have a notification at the field where we as sellers have to enter the list of deliveries allowed? if each individual was to read the paypal policies - how many people would actually sign up?\n\nI hope this helps for anyone using paypal and ebay.\n\nbest", 'review_date': '2011-04-25', 'review_time': '09:55:13', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
