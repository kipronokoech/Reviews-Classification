This time not the case!! They placed the funds from two eBay transactions On Hold totalling £700. The items were both collection only so no tracking numbers. I had a real struggle getting anyone at PayPal to understand my messages to them. They just copy and paste info back that has no relevance to the question being asked ! Unable to reach them by phone always too busy and got cut off. Eventually I did manage to find out that unless I could get the buyer to mark the item as received via their eBay account I would not get money for 21 days! Apparently I need to always provide tracking numbers for my sales! How on earth can you do that for a ride on mower I dont think Royal Mail would deliver that somehow! I think it's just an excuse to hold onto funds for as long as they can . My sellers history is A1 / 100% on eBay for almost 300 sales !!

This has both euro and UK Sterling accounts attached to it and allows me to pay in Euro when I am buying from the eurozone, which is where my home address is and Sterling when buying from the UK. Recently I made a purchase from a merchant in my own home country so currency exchange shouldn\'t enter into the equation but Paypal found a way. They paid in Sterling and then converted it themselves to euro and added multiple charges along the way. This is apparently called Dynamic Currency Exchange and is a service offered "for the convenience of the customer". It is also offered by ATMs and merchants when you are abroad and allows you to see the final amount in your own currency but you will pay for the privilege. Always decline it or if accepting it know why you are accepting it. It is usually avoidable but you have to know how it works. This was all explained to me by Revolut not by PayPal who applied it. My purchase in my own home country cost me about 4% more than it should have. Paypal denied all liability and basically said it was my own fault. They did eventually refund the difference as a "gesture of goodwill" which is why they get 2 stars, otherwise they would have got one.', 'review_date': '2020-06-19', 'review_time': '08:56:49', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

I am a professional bookseller of over 20 years\' standing - the seller is clearly someone trying to clear out their attic.\n\nThe book I received was in truly appalling condition, nothing like as described and not fit for purpose. There is no way I can sell it on - I\'d even be ashamed to donate it to charity. Amongst a plethora of flaws - none of which the seller mentioned - there is a split to the inside front hinge.

This alone would cost me £8.80, not to mention a special trip to the post office, with the added risk of Covid 19.\n\nIf you think that I am going to do this, you are very much mistaken.
