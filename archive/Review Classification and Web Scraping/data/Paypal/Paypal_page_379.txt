It all started when I couldn't check out with my card on my PayPal account. Contacting customer support was horrible. Their chat system was extremely buggy on mobile. The AI bot was literally broken, and when I responded to its questions it would often just loop. After much trial and error, I finally got through to a person who said my card had been blocked for security. I cannot imagine why this could possibly be as I never use my card. Anyways, they said they removed the block and to wait 48 hours. I did this, and the block was still there. I went through this exact same process of wrestling the chatbot, and then was told the same thing again, only this time to wait 72 hours, which I did. Surprise, the block was still there. At this point I just rage-quit for a little while. During these times, I tried calling the customer support number, which, just like the chatbot, takes a great deal of intelligence and wrestling to actually get through to a person. When I did this, the wait time was too much so I hung up. Note: they actually deactivated their support number now. I couldn't stop laughing at that. A few months later I tried again and for whatever reason, my card was unblocked. This time, I was having trouble logging into my account on computer, it told me to verify I'm not a robot using a phone number. I put in my cell phone number, which is linked to my account, and it said invalid number. No, it was not a VOIP number. It was my real cell number. The only possible excuse for this was that it was through an MVNO, often used for burner phones. But this is insane due to the number of people who use this as their primary phone, effectively just locking them out of PayPal for not wanting to choose one of the main carriers directly. Anyways, I tried my landline phone and missed the call, and tried again and missed it again. I have call forwarding set up on it which sometimes glitches out. I tried a third time but couldn't because you know, if someone tries to use a phone number 3 times, it's definitely a bot. I even went so far as to change my phone number (I use Google Voice for my main number I give to friends, family etc so it wasn't a big deal) and it still didn't like that number. I reached out to customer service, only this time the guy clearly didn't read my question and literally copy and pasted a link to something that did not answer my question, and closed the chat before I had the chance to tell him that he might want to do the painstaking work of reading my question first instead of just skimming it over. That's all.\nEdit: forgot to mention that a friend had sent me $40 that I couldn't access for several months because of this block", 'review_date': '2021-03-08', 'review_time': '04:05:02', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
