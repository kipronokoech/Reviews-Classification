My boss then calls and tells them they need to release the funds to me, which they still did not. I ended up refunding the money and my boss and I had to drive to meet half way (he lives an hour out of town) so he could pay me by check. I refunded his paypal payment and paypal has STILL not released the funds to him. They\'re system of holding onto payments is antiquated and their customer service is absolute garbage.
