My account got locked because of a misunderstanding concerning the credit card of my father. At first I tried to reach them via their support chat but it always said no worker was available at the moment and that I should try again during the mentioned timeframe. Well, needless to say I had always tried during that time... Next I tried to mail them directly and wrote a nice, detailed summary of the problem, but only automatic replies returned. When I finally got a reply from a human about a month later they just asked a one-sentence-question that had nothing to do with my issue. After that came only automatic replies, again. Next I tried to phone them, and after a few tries I actually got through and talked with a worker. He told me to send a copy of the credit card bill and a signed explanation of the misunderstanding to a specific mail adress, which I did shortly after the call had ended. With that, I thought the issue was finally resolved. But after another two weeks still nothing had changed. I sent the same mail again, then I only sent "..." because I was really getting annoyed. Surprisingly someone reacted to that, saying the content of the mail was unclear to them, and telling me to explain my issue. So I resent all the documents and the explanation AGAIN. All I finally got was a message saying they will not reactivate my account due to safety issues and my money will be locked for 180 days. Well, thank you for nothing, Paypal.', 'review_date': '2020-10-28', 'review_time': '12:15:35', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

It took me 6 months to have a complaint dealt with from a purchase from China. Then paypal said there was nothing they could do but just refund me some of the return shipping cost. They only refunded me $30 US back for some of my shipping costs. Which my costs were over $130 US. So then another 6 months of this sitting in my paypal account and trying to have paypal just mail be back the refund. They declined. I stated then refund my credit card. They declined. I could not reach any supervisor or manager. All the customer service reps speak with an accent from a third world country and not comprehend English. I then stated etransfer this back to me. They declined. They stated they wanted me to register a bank and card. I said why, I am cancelling this account as soon as you refund me. They said that was the only way. Upon trying to register an account it asks for your card number and your pin number!! Heck no. I called back again and continually asked for a manager. All I was told was that was the only way. I said no, I don't even have a bank so now how are you going to refund me. They then stated have a friend use their account or buy something using the account balance. I said I don't know anyone that uses your unprofessional business. You should be shutdown. I said so what happens if I delete my account. They stated they won't delete it with a balance. Unbelievable. I do not recommend to use paypal ever.

In other words, if you are a small start up or entrepreneur during COVID, Paypal will not help you. Their select software products are only for a chosen few. FACT.\n\nThese two issues transpired simultaneously and involved two different people and the simultaneous timing proves Paypal is riddled with problems of different sorts - Big problems.

Obviously, Paypal never read my numerous communications with the company closely or to Paypal, since they simply stated that the company supplied a delivery receipt. The company initially stated that USPS delivered, but the USPS never received or delivered the package. Then the company sent a receipt supposedly from an International shipper. But it was not from a recognized shipper, nor was it a domestic shipper. The receipt is a document which I could have typed and forwarded.
