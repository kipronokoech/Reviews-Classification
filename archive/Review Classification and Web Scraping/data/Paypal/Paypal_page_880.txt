I opened a claim with paypal and i had to wait 7 days for them to respond before i was given my money. 12 hours before they give me my money kinguin sent me an email FINALLY responds. They try to strong arm me and say i must close the ticket if i want to resolve anything with them. I do not trust anyone who is this sketchy and responding only when they are required to do so at the last second. After providing paypal with screenshots of my talk with blizzard employees CONFIRMING that they were EU codes and 1 was used and I COULD NOT USE THEM paypal closed the ticket and i was given nothing. This is the same paypal who gave me my money back for a stolen iphone i bought off ebay and didnt even ask me to send the phone back (stolen or not i dont know why they would not care about me keeping it). that incident was closed in 7 days because i also proved proof the phone was most likely stolen at the time with all the error codes of it being locked and it was later confirmed to be stolen. the total lost was $68 Canadian and i still have not gotten money back or store credit. so why would they refund $400 for a phone but not $68 for some codes that i had more proof at the time for? unless they have some deal cut with kinguin. i still keep opening more tickets with kinguin and paypal, and the 2nd $40+ code hasnt been used. if this is not resolved in 1 week ill go to my bank and get the manager that we are close with take the money back and i wont be using paypal anymore. kinguin is definatly off my ist of companies to buy keys from.', 'review_date': '2015-11-21', 'review_time': '06:09:58', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

When I finished paying for the item, I received an email from PayPal with the debt information for my purchased. However, eBay sends me a note saying they didn't receive any payment and told me to complaint with PayPal and request the refund. What I tried to do in less than five minutes afterwards the information was received from eBay. When I connected to my PayPal account, I was capable to see the debt, but there is no way of cancelling the transaction. I send couples old emails to PayPal and received no response. I then called PayPal in the US and told them the whole story, but they just told me that I have to open a dispute case and wait until they go through all the details. I told that there is no need of it, eBay says they didn't get money from PayPal and I didn't get my item, therefore, just cancel the transaction, but they refused. I requested the attendant to talk to a supervisor who did absolutely nothing and they kept changing my phone call to different people and each time I had to say the whole story over and over again. I spent 58 minutes of an international call and was regaled as I was the one wrong. Why an unsuccessful transaction cannot be canceled within in five minutes time? I could not have got any good from Hong Kong within five minutes. The PayPal supervisor told me that they work just like a credit card, and I had to wait for a resolution. Well, if they function like a credit card, why anyone would use PayPal to purchase anything? We can do that straight away with our credit card. We use PayPal for safety, at least I guessed they were safe, but they are not. Their staff has no willingness to resolve any problem, they don't try to understand your situation, they do not connect you to the right people, instead they keep you on the phone for a long time transferring the call from one to the other. I am confident that my credit card company would treat me with more respect than PayPal employee. They have a horrible employee service. PayPal is only beneficial when you can do all your things by yourself and donÂ´t have to contact them, but if anything goes wrong then you are in trouble. I disconnected the phone disappointed and embarrassed. I have lost my money, but more than losing my money, I lost my dignity and esteem.

I had to buy a mobile phone (OnePlus 2) which was up for sale online only for 1 hour. When I added the phone to my cart, I found out that OnePlus only accept payments by PayPal. Last time I used PayPal was back in 2009 or 2010 I think. So, so not surprisingly, I had forgotten the password. So I tried the following things:\n\n1. Tried the "forgot password feature", got an email with a link to reset password, but when clicked on it, it took me to PayPal\'s homepage instead of the password reset page. So, turned out that the "forgot password feature" is broken! How nice.\n\n2. Next tried the "reset by phone call" feature. Received a call, entered the given code, phone got verified. But back on web it is now asking answers to my two secret questions! Why ask that if I have already verified my phone? And why make password resetting so hard, really! Of course, like password, I had forgotten my secret answers as well.\n\n3. Called customer service (in Denmark). The guy could not understand/spell my name/email address, despite I trying many times. He told me I need to send them an email by going to "contact us", in this way he will get my name/email address. I told him there is no way to email them from the "contact us" feature. He found out I was right and told me to use the "submit a complaint" feature to do that. Which I then did. I called again, this time it was a lady and she easily understood my email address. She sent me email with password reset link, which upon clicking, again took me to PayPal homepage. She then admitted that their "forgot password feature" is experiencing some "technical problems" right now. I asked cannot she reset the password for me? She told they cannot reset the password at their side. It has to be done by the user, for security reasons. She then told that they expect to solve it within 2 days (this was some 2 WEEKS ago and the problem is still unsolved)! I explained them I need it fixed now because I have to pay for something right now. They told the best option right now is to create another account, e.g. for my wife, and use that for payment. Later got the call from the first guy again, telling me to clear cookies and cache of my Internet browser, to make it work. I did it for all three browsers I have on my machine, and also on my Linux machine, but it still didn\'t work!\n\nAnyway, after trying everything, I ended up creating a PayPal account for my wife and paid it using that, in the nick of time, right at the last few minutes of the 1 hour window.\n\nAnd the problem with my account is still unsolved!\n\nNow you know why I would never recommend PayPal to anyone.', 'review_date': '2015-11-02', 'review_time': '21:13:30', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
