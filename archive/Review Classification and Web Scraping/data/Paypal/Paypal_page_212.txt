I then called and got transferred to PayPal's account review and asked what was going on and that I wanted to dispute the case,the guy I talked to said my account had too many disputes and charge backs. I told him that I only had 5 within 3 years,he didn't seem to care. I then asked him about my $162 I still had in my account,he said that I wouldn't be able to use my own money for 6 months or even withdraw it. I told him that I still had bills to pay and that was all the money I had for the rest of the month,he said he didn't know what to tell me. I asked him to be transferred to someone else but,he said no matter who I talked to the outcome would be the same.I started to cry over the fact that I wouldn't be able to pay the rest of my bills,his lack of caring,and being completely rude. I decided to email them instead of calling them to try to figure the problem out 5 days ago,I still haven't gotten an answer.

Here are 5 reasons you need to avoid them:\n1) They don\'t honor what they say - When we tried to switch to Hyperwallet, a PP solution, they approved our application then, after my developers took time to review all the API documentation, they said "sorry, we\'ve decided PP Payouts is a better solution for you," presumably because we pay WAY more in fees with this option.\n2) They hold your funds for WEEKS - Between Braintree (also a terrible PP company) and Paypal, they nearly sunk our software startup by holding tens of thousands of dollars saying "we are waiting on the bank to clear the funds" or "your clients bank has not cleared the funds." Bulls***, you hold the money because you make incremental interest via MM funds and pass the blame off to others.\n3) Their fees are outrageous - They will nickel and dime you the entire way until they\'ve carved out 5-10% of your profit margins with their fees.\n4) I\'ve heard horror stories from ex-employees, along the lines of "it\'s a complete s***show over there." There is no cohesion between PP and the companies they\'ve acquired (e.g. Braintree and Hyperwallet). For f*** sake Braintree can\'t even deposit money directly to Paypal and it\'s a PP solution, which brings me to...\n5) It takes weeks to transfer money from BT to PP. There is simply no excuse for this. Coinbase can instantly transfer money to my bank and to Paypal. Their excuse is "the bank holds the money..." Guess what, you can bipass the banks by going directly from Braintree to PP but you refuse to because either a) you can charge more fees by going indirect or b) you are too unorganized to integrate your own two companies.\n\nThere are plenty of other solutions out there that are more innovative. We are switching to Checkbook.io which seems like a much better, more modern solution for our needs and charges, what we\'ve calculated, to be about 20% of what PP charges.', 'review_date': '2022-04-08', 'review_time': '16:42:08', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
