I have given them every detail of my business and explained why it's critical to my success that my account not be locked for ridiculous reasons and yet I just got 2 of my largest shipments canceled due to the current hold on my account. This is the 3rd time in less than 90days. Your business will suffer for sure if you use them. Get a bank account. I just found out banks offer card readers as well.

The name makes it look like they are your Pal. However in reality they do little for their Customers and more for the merchants. You are better off using your checking/credit account. Let me set an example. When you go into a site and you are just trying to pay for a one time service, these merchants hide the little prints. For example you think you are paying $10 and then you get hit by hundreds of dollars because the small print said you were going to enroll in a membership in 7 days if you don't cancel. However they only show you a balance of $10 to approve. If you don't read the entire thing you are hit with the hole amount. PayPal doesn't give you any heads-up, so why use PayPal?.

They cannot integrate merchant services into a website - although they claim they can.\n(1) They twice have lost confidential personal information required to start the process. So much for UK and EU data protection laws.\n(2) The call centre, where English is obviously a second language, does not have access to all client interactions at technical level. They are authorised only to deal with small issues.\n(3) I was advised by the call centre to phone two dedicated business support lines: 0800 358 7929, and/or 0870 730 1881. On dialling the first number a recorded message announced it was no longer in use. I phoned the second line and, instead of being put through to a "dedicated business support operative" was reconnect, after a long delay, back to the original overseas call centre where we went round the detail of the problem for the third time.\nLuckily, my phone company (BT) texted me to warn I had been connected to a premium rate (scam) number which was racking up my phone bill, so I hung up before Paypal took too much money.\n(4) I have since complained three times about the poor service plus the arguably illegal trick with the premium line. Not until I mentioned the FCA, The UK Financial Conduct Authority, did anyone reply.\n(5) They asked for all the detail again and then eventually emailed back to advise it would take them 8 weeks to get around to considering my complaint.\n(6) Today, I received an email headed "Final Response" which re-stated their earlier comment that by calling the call centre they had (somehow) deemed that to be a resolution to the problem. They suggested I write to some organisation in Luxembourg instead.\nConclusion: use Paypal only for low value, simple transactions.
