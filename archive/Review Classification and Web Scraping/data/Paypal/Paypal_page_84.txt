I made that shopping, I said that I will suspend again after that again. Well, I didn't.\nMy partner started to sell my kids old lego collections on the Facebook market.

My partner kept the postage slip for a few month then she thrown to the bin as we didn't have any complain. We sold quite a few things on facebook before and had 100% satisfactions all the time.\nLast week, the PayPal frozen my account. They said that because of a complain. Well, we didn't receive any information about it. They didn't tell me which customer complained, we didn't receive any feedback nor from the Facebook, neither from PayPal. I called them to refund me my money balance, but they said that they will just after 180 days. So no Lego and no money either.\n\nThese people are criminals!
