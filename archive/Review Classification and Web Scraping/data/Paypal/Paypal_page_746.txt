The wig was like something you'd pass by in a joke shop. I opened a dispute. After researching Howig I came across copious negative reviews of people being forced to send a product back to a scam company based in China only to have the item refused delivery - so NO refund. I have sent a number of emails to PayPal explaining this and even given them names of other wig companies owned by the same people. My emails have gone unanswered. I contacted PayPal by telephone today (27/05/19) and was put through to a man based in their Dublin call centre named Keith. I have autism and struggle greatly with verbal communication. I attempted to explain this to Keith who spoke over me repeatedly telling me that I have to return item to China. I, again attempted to explain that this was a scam company who purposefully set out to con vulnerable buyers. I stated that I was recording the call - I didn't have time to finish my sentence because Keith went off on a rant and ended the call! Thank you for treating me like crap Keith and lying through your teeth about how Paypal have not had any negative feedback regarding Howigs...", 'review_date': '2019-05-27', 'review_time': '15:00:17', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
