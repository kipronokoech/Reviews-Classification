Asking things like: Show a receipt from your supplier, how does your business work, describe these last purchases. I didn\'t have any money on the account nor did I take any orders. I only had personal purchases and sent some funds to my friends, so that is what I put in the description box.\n\nI called customer service asking why the restriction was put on and they told me it was just a security measurement?? which is weird when there are no received sales on my end. They assured me that my account looked fine and that I just needed to send in my passport to confirm my identity and it shouldn\'t be an issue and the account didn\'t have any risk of getting closed.\n\nYesterday I got a mail saying the account got permanently closed due to "At PayPal, we value a safe community for our customers to do business. " without further comments or explanations which is extremely weird as I have been using the account as a personal account and buying things online, sending and receiving money to my friends internationally and have nothing to do with doing business. I haven\'t done any disputes or had any disputes the past 2 years of having the account.\n\nI called the customer service again and they told me they would send the information to the department and get back to me which they never did.\n\nI remembered that I had an order back from June that I didn\'t receive yet. Paypal claims that they have 6 month protection so I called today to ask if they could start a dispute to get my money back as I didn\'t get my item and couldn\'t do it on my account as paypal closed my account randomly despite stating there wasn\'t any issues and they would usually give you 2 months prior warning should it happen.\n\nThe reason they closed my account was "we value a safe community for our customers to do business." So I sure was frustrated that I as a customer got this back in the mail after calling.\n"I contacted the relevant department and they informed me that we can not create a case for you with reason code, \'Item not received\'. Since your PayPal account has been permanently closed, you are no longer considered our customer and therefore you are not covered by our buyer protection."\n\nThey closed my account because of they "value a safe community for our customers" but yet they close their customers accounts randomly without prior notice and doesn\'t even ensure that their previous purchases are safe and done properly.\n\nI called them again to ask them to appeal the account and to make sure to mention that I just wanted them to appeal it so I could close my unfinished purchases yet the customer service didn\'t state that at all?? and put\n"Costumer wants to appeal this decicion, when going through the account please take into consideration that this account was mainly used as a personal account which explains the large number of personal payments."\n\nI\'m extremely frustrated and honestly to anyone using or planning to use paypal. I can\'t recommend you enough to just boycutt this horrible company who doesn\'t value their customers and is scamming businesses by restricting and holding their funds for 180 days with no promise that you can get your funds at all after those 180 days.\n\nSave yourself some time, headache and frustrations and use better alternatives.\nBoycutt them and don\'t let them earn a single cent from the money that you earned.', 'review_date': '2021-10-22', 'review_time': '15:14:28', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

Both times has been a complete nightmare.\n\n1st time was because I got married so had to change my surname on my account. They wanted me to send photo ID. I asked what the point was since they had never ever seen what I look like. I could send a photo of mickey mouse and say it was me. Next they said they wanted my marriage certificate to show my new signature. Well, as you sign using your previous name, that wouldn\'t have worked either. We went round and round in circles. In the end I decided it was so much easier to close my account and open a new one in my new name. I\'m hoping their process for name changing is better these days!\n\n2nd time, just now... I received suspicious emails saying my account had been transferred because I had negative balance. I tried to log in to see what was going on but my email address came up as unknown. So I called customer services. I don\'t want to be unkind or insulting, but I really struggle to understand people with strong foreign accents, so that was frustrating in itself. I ended up explaining my story to 5 different people, in different departments, and really didn\'t resolve anything at all. All I know is that a transaction wasn\'t paid off in the normal way by direct debit. I don\'t know why because there\'s no issue on my side. So that put me in "negative balance". I didn\'t recognise the transaction, I said that repeatedly, I also said I was worried someone had hacked my account. Nobody seemed to understand the whole picture. They could only deal with their little bit (eg unlocking my account). Anyway, I\'ve finally managed to get into my account... but I honestly find the activity log so difficult to understand (I mean why show a single transaction in 5 different ways - I want to see the amount, and whether it\'s in or out, and then the balance).\n\nOn reading so many bad reviews here, plus not feeling 100% that transactions don\'t go through more than once, I think it\'s now time to close my account...', 'review_date': '2021-10-22', 'review_time': '10:41:39', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
