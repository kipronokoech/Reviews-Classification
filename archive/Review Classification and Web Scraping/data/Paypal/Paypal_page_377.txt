A truly horrible organisation to deal with. They have the ability to simply dip into your bank account which is linked to your PayPal and steal your money as a result of any buyer forcing a refund from you - whether you like it or not. It really is criminal behaviour, as the buyer is automatically assumed to be telling the truth - in my case they weren't; they were fraudsters and yet PayPal simply accept their word against yours. It's indiscriminate and I'm left nearly £700 out of pocket and I have no idea what to do. I cannot believe this can happen in the 21st Century. I warn you not to deal with PayPal unless you are prepared to be bullied by this horrible corporation and potentially be the victim of fraud - and lose a lot of money, like I have.", 'review_date': '2021-03-05', 'review_time': '03:07:17', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
