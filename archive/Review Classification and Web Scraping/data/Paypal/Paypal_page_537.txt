I have been trying for months (probably longer now) to remove one of my checking accounts as a pay source on PayPal, because it\'s been closed for over a year. So that\'s probably about how long I have tried to remove it. Their shotty site won\'t let me remove it even when I have no pending transactions at all. One girl kept claiming I did when I could see plain as day, that the last transaction had already completed. She was talking as if she was guessing. I got so frustrated I hung up. Fast forward 1 year, tried again just now, and the shotty system is still not allowing me to remove the closed account, I have always had another account as the preferred pay source even last year. So that is not the problem either. I tried calling and the IVR appears to be programmed to say, "We cannot assist you with your inquiry by phone, please use the site..." or something to that effect, no matter what you ask for. All of the links related "help" are nothing more than canned solutions and give directions that I have already tried over and over and over, getting the same stupid message that they cannot process my request ( no reason) and to try later. This is the same message I have gotten for a year now. As soon as I get this account off of here, I am canceling my entire Pay Pal account. I sent a message about a week ago and no one responded at all!! This is ridiculous. I bet if I owed them money they would contact me fast enough. I can\'t even get a live rep, which is what I clearly need, since the site is absolute GARBAGE!!!!', 'review_date': '2020-08-06', 'review_time': '19:51:18', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
