I just want it to be over. Started out being unhappy with merchandise that I had ordered and paid through PayPal. That was the easy part. Long and the short of it a refund was offered by the vendor but said I had to contact PayPal that they couldn't refund directly. This communication was done and recorded in PayPal. On 7/19/20 Pearl from the Limitation Dept. escalated the case indicating they would give the vendor until 7/29 to respond otherwise they would close the case in my favor. Case ID: PP-D-74734781 has sat idle since then with the only action is PayPal pushing the estimated Resolution Date every 5 or 7 days. It's right there in their Resolution Center...an offer was made to me by the vendor, I accepted, the vendor said I had to contact PayPal which I did. And nothing!! I have wasted so much time and the merchandise sits in a bag in my house as none of it fits. I'm not spending more money to return it to China. And that's why I reached out to PayPal to begin with. Sad, sad way to do business by PayPal and the vendor both. I just want my refund as offered. End of story.\nNo, not end of story. On 10/15, almost 3 months after I had reached out to PayPal to help get my 40% refund I received their response.... return the items and get full refund. All I need to do is send the merchandise to China and provide tracking information. There is no place on their claim site to respond to say this is utterly unacceptable.

Paypal with whom they no doubt have close links accept their verbal claims which is unheard of in legal terms and practice. They will ask you - instead of the company - to provide proof of the contract which only the company has and proof of cancellation even though you never agreed to something in the first place. That is illogical, irrational and should be illegal but as usual they regulators are completely useless, asleep, lazy, complicit and ineffective and allow abuse on a enormous scale to persist to allow these companies to benefit in the meantime and take in millions. The wholes system is corrupt and most of you haven’t got a clue and some even think otherwise, ignorance is a funny thing which can cause so many others to suffer and one day your loved ones – great achievement! Only after it happens to you and you experience it do you wake up to it, but you do nothing to prevent others experiencing it first or you preventing it later. That is the first sign of low intelligence and having selfish tendencies whether you understand it or not. You don’t now the half of it. PayPal don't provide final response letters so just log a complaint with the Financial Ombudsman online as each complaint can cost PayPal £400 so that will force them to be more customer friendly. Also, call trading standards and log a complaint - 40 complains will get them investigated which will cost them a lot and cause changes. And you can call your credit card and dispute the PayPal payment in question and get it recalled as being without your authority so then PayPal have to prove it. Useless, complicit, bias, corrupt regulators wont tell you all that. All in denial and totally corrupt. Wow never knew it was this bad, what an awakening. Sometimes I wish I was still asleep, in peace at least...best part of the day...which when I wirte it down is not good, in fact very sad.
