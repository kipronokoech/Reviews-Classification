Since PayPal no longer disburses any part of your payment to promo charges, all of my payment went to the non promo balance. A customer rep told me I had to call to request to get the disbursements. So, I called. The payment was disbursed except for .31 cents. I made ANOTHER payment, called AGAIN to request that part of the payment should take care of the .31 cent. The very next day I am charged a miscellaneous payment of $244.69. I called to ask what the charge is; I did not make a charge for that amount. They told me fraud had been committed; deactivated my account, and gave me a new number. I just got off the phone with a rep. PayPal recharges you the amount you ask to allocate to promo charges because all payments automatically go to standard balances. They basically negated my payment. None of this makes sense. So now there’s a miscellaneous charge that is gathering interest. You are punished if you take advantage of their promotional hoodwinking and punished even more if you want to pay the promo charges off early. PRETTY MUCH DONE WITH SYNCHRONY BANK WHO HAS TAKEN OVER PAYPAL. PAYPAL/SYNCHRONY BANK IS THE EPITOME OF GREED. Not worth the stress! Started using AfterPay! Much better experience! Paying off PayPal and closing my account. I’m not letting the $244.69 go - I know that’s what PP wants me to do, but that’s not happening.', 'review_date': '2023-04-21', 'review_time': '02:14:43', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
