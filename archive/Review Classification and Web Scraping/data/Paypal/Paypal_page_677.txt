Over the years of me selling high priced computers I have the occasional buyer who needed to change an address or type of payment. eBay policy is that in situations where an address or payment method needs to be changed that the seller must refund the buyer and then re-list the item so the buyer can purchase the item under the correct address or correct form of payment.\n\nSuch a situation happened recently where a buyer had a wrong address for shipment of a high priced computer. 3 minutes after ordering, the customer messaged me via eBay email and asked if I could cancel the order and re-submit it with their new address as they had moved and forgot to change the address in the eBay system. Easy enough request.. So I thought.\n\nPayPal has charged a fee for using their services via eBay since the very beginning. The difference however is that starting in September of this year (2019) they no longer refund their 2.9% fee for returns. Under circumstances where the error happened early I was told in August when I called in concerned that the fee was waived. They state that it is industry standard not to return fees and they are only doing what others do. Well to multi-billion dollar companies it may be standard practice, but to small businesses on Etsy and eBay that isn't the case. 2.9% is a lot when selling multi-thousand dollar computer systems.\n\nExactly 4 minutes after the buyer asked to cancel I called PayPal to inform them of the customer error and that I would need to redo the eBay transaction as eBay policy requires. I wanted re-assurance that the 2.9% fee would only be pulled out once since the buyer was going to rebuy the same item momentarily. I was told that I would need to do a refund which I did. The 2.9% fee that PayPal took out however would not be returned and another 2.9% fee would be taken. I explained the situation again as it was an error not on my part, but that of the customer and I was told that their policy was clearly communicated earlier this year and I was not able to avoid being charged twice the 2.9% fee.\n\nTo make matters worse with the fee not being returned the buyer now has to wait 3-5 business days for the refund to be sent since my PayPal account doesn't have the required amount to fully refund them. If the 2.9% fee had been refunded the new transaction would have been able to happen immediately.\n\nI am more frustrated at the level of disregard that PayPal has for their customers. They will no doubt gain more money by profiting from honest mistakes from Mom and Pop shop's customers who need to change information on an order, but I am no longer able to put my money and trust in a company that has a clear conscience double charging their long-time clients.", 'review_date': '2019-12-15', 'review_time': '07:29:04', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
