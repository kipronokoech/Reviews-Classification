While paying 8$ I signed up for subscription with 7 days trial, because there is no way to get the results otherwise. As soon as I got them, I went on their web site to cancel the subscription, but they do not offer that possibility. So I sent them an email stating I want it canceled I refuse to pay more money. It was 2 minutes into my subscription. They did't respond.\nI went to PayPal's resolution center and filed a dispute. This was 6 days ago. Still waiting for PayPal's reaction. I added a lot of additional info, such as bank statement, Brainety invoice, PayPal notification of charging.\nLater I found out many people got scammed by this f****** page.\n\nHope I'll get my money back.\n\n\n\nUPDATE 17.7.\nBrainety asked for additional info on my review, maybe they do pay me back my money seeing I tried to cancel subscription via email, but they ignored it.\nWill post an update in either case.\n\n19. 7. PayPal closed my case, not getting a refund.\nNow I am scared the paxments will continue. I'll have to contact authorities. PayPal is not letting me close my account saying I have open casase.

{'platform': 'Paypal', 'id': '64b1ebada67f49c49f23c0b9', 'stars': 3, 'title': 'Decent Payment Processing with Room for Improvement', 'message': "PayPal has established itself as a widely recognized and convenient payment solution, but it has its fair share of shortcomings. While it offers some benefits, there are aspects of PayPal that could be improved upon.\n\nOne of the notable advantages of using PayPal is its widespread acceptance. Many online merchants and service providers support PayPal as a payment method, making it a convenient option for customers. The user interface is generally straightforward, making it easy to send and receive payments, and the ability to link bank accounts and credit cards provides flexibility in funding sources.\n\nHowever, PayPal's fees can be quite high, especially for certain types of transactions. The fee structure can be complex to understand, and it's important for users to carefully review the associated costs. Additionally, when it comes to currency conversion, PayPal's exchange rates are often less favorable compared to other alternatives, leading to potential financial losses for international transactions.\n\nAnother drawback is PayPal's customer support, which is known for being inconsistent. While some users have reported positive experiences, others have faced challenges when trying to resolve issues. The response times can vary, and the overall support experience may not always meet expectations.\n\nPayPal's dispute resolution process can also be frustrating for users. While it offers protection against unauthorized transactions and buyer/seller disputes, the resolution process can be lengthy and complex. This can result in delays and potential frustrations for those seeking resolution for payment-related problems.\n\nFurthermore, PayPal's account limitations and occasional freezes are known to cause inconvenience for users. These restrictions can be imposed with little to no explanation, leaving users without access to their funds and requiring additional steps to resolve the issue.\n\nIn conclusion, PayPal is a widely accepted and convenient payment solution, but it falls short in several areas. The high fees, unfavorable currency conversion rates, inconsistent customer support, and occasional account limitations detract from the overall user experience. While it remains a popular choice for many, PayPal could benefit from addressing these concerns to provide a more reliable and user-friendly payment service.", 'review_date': '2023-07-15', 'review_time': '02:43:25', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
