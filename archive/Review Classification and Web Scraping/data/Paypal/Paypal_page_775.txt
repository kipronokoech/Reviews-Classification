First of all beware of sending money as a purchase or business when its between two individuals. I think its a default menu issue since Paypal's screen structures are horrible, very often there is no indication of an option, the default is probably what you don't want. In my case there was a $28 fee on a $925 transaction. It is reversible, but again beware the screens and also what customer service tells you. I was told to have the funds (excepting fee) available in the account so I transferred it back into my Paypal account (wait 3 business days). After 5 days called customer service again to complete refund, turns out its an online process (agent didn't tell me that on first call). So I set in motion the refund, wait another 5 days, and process is still pending with a transaction amount shown of $0.30 more than my original credit from the transaction. The next day I clicked on the refund item listing (an experiment, no indication it was clickable) and low and behold transaction details came up showing funds were drawn from a different bank account number registered with Paypal. Glory be the transaction was finally showing completed, not pending. So, I had to transfer the funds waiting in the Paypal acct back to my bank, transfer funds between bank accounts since drawn on wrong account, and contact sender once again about status of transaction. On their end Paypal was complete but bank transaction was not. At this point I estimate it a 15 day exercise to reverse a transaction with all the bank delays involved. Paypal should be renamed to Bank Slush Fund, they (and the banks) get to play with your money a couple weeks thanks to obtuseness of menu structures and legislated bank transfer delays, oh, and customer service's lack of correct guidance.
