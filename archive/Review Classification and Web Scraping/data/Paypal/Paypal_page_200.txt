Everyone understands and everyone is very polite in telling you kindly to get lost.\n\nHope this sheds light to how Paypal is supposedly supporting Ukraine right now.\n\nAlso their contract is as abstract as Picassos paintings.\nwith vague sentences about blocking an account due to "Send or receive what we reasonably believe to be potentially fraudulent funds;"\n\nWell that is lovely, and what does that mean?

She told me that if I canceled my Pay Pal account I would never be able to open a Pay Pal account ever again. I told her to cancel the account. She repeatedly asked me if I wanted to pay the amount due. I finally found out what the debt was for, paid for it, canceled my account and when they asked why I was canceling I told her that they were rude, the company was rude and Pay Pal agents are rude and did not help customers at all.

They charged fees without informing me and even refused to say how much was charged. Then they wrongfully debited my account without warning, claiming that I received duplicate refunds. When I called customer service, the "account specialist" belittled me and called me "dear". So condescending and unprofessional. This same person even said "who do you need to explain this to you for you to understand?", as if I was the confused one. No matter the evidence I provided, she said that their system is flawless and that I\'m wrong. She literally yelled at me and said "no, the system is correct, you were refunded twice! You owe PayPal x amount of $!". I told her that I confirmed with my credit card company that I never received such refund but she wouldn\'t even listen. Ridiculous. They are the ones that actually owe me money since they took my money from horrible exchange rate and fees I didn\'t even know about (over $100). She also tried to connect me to her supervisor saying that her supervisor agrees with her, but I was never connected. She said "you\'re welcome" before putting me on hold and just hung up on me. The very next day PayPal credited most of what they took (I guess they looked into it and found what was wrong? I had to spend 5 hours on the phone and chat with them for this to happen though). However, I still had a negative balance because they took more money than refunded. After talking to several different customer service specialists, they offered me a voucher I can use on my next purchase. I just accepted that and paid off the negative balance. I\'m still losing more than $100 though. It\'s just not worth any more of my time to get that money back. PayPal\'s messaging system is a complete joke as well. They closed the message on me twice, without resolving my issue or answering my question.
