But I am now going into my third month regarding a dispute and claim against a company who quickly took my money for an order I placed but never sent the item. Then I discover the company has a non working phone. They replied to my email once claiming they had no record of my transaction, despite my invoice. So I told PayPal this, who promptly acted as though I’m stupid and said I should “try to work it out” with the seller. Duh! I already tried that multiple times, which I explained in my claim. As someone else here wrote, I don’t think any human reads my information, that it is all automated. And so the status remains pending.\n\nUPDATE: After two months of no helpful feedback from PayPal, I suddenly received an emailed notice that they are refunding my money in this claim. That pleases me, but it would have been nice to receive updates regarding progress in this case.', 'review_date': '2020-07-14', 'review_time': '11:36:50', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

I used Paypal for the first time as I wanted to make sure the payment was safe. Paypal basically charged me 123 eur more than they should have. I even received from them invoice with the amount that I authorized. Thats when the pain started as I opened a dispute and was declined with a generic statement. So I reopened it again, explained the issue again ... and was declined with a very unrelated comment again. I reopened it again plus send them a formal complaint. They reacted to it but pretty much just let me know that my credit card was charged in USD which accounted for the difference. I again wrote to them that I authorized the payment in Eur and I wasnt informed antime during or after the process that they are going to charge me more. The most interesting fact is that the seller told me that they received only the original amount so it seems Paypal stole from me 123 eur with a single transaction!!! I demanded the money back but the customer setvice told me they are not in a position to make decisions. I lost patience and opened a formal dispute via European Union bodies.

Despite me informing them that I hadn't authorised a payment they decided against me? I even informed them that I had written to the company who requested the money beforehand and specifically stated that they did not have my permission to take this money. Paypal in their misrepresenting and bullying nature have deemed that it's ok to 'steal' my money and hand it over to another company without my permission. They then inform me that this isn't covered under their policy. So on that basis what PayPal are saying here is that they have the right to to steal money from accounts and simply give it away to someone else even though you have proved that you did not authorise or give consent for the payment in the fist place. I just don't get that... Where is the loyalty to their customers who like me, have spent tens of thousands of pounds with them over the years? Another example of a business structure who places money ahead of anything else including the law in the UK. They then make it impossible to challenge because they don't care. I'm not saying don't use them folks just that when you think you are dealing with a company who have your back and you have shown your loyalty for almost a decade, it's a one way journey and at the end of that road trip, all that matters is the pound sign you carry on your back. Paypal here in my opinion have acted without morals have have allowed an unlawful transaction.
