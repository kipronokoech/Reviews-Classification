After days of not being able to get acces or even be able to contact paypal because ironically you have to login to send an email - I finally got access. Just to have the exact same problems when trying to transfer the balance on my paypal account to my bank account. After yet another week of trying I senf them an email because I'm getting desperate and impatient. I get a response on my email and i have to login to see the response - just to find out that the SECURITY MEASURES yet again are not allowinh me to go in and see my account.\nGreat job paypal.

If we can\'t contact him in 7 days we will refund you". Six hours later i get an email saying we decided the case in the seller\'s favour. What a joke! They didn\'t even check with Royal Mail. Most lazy and useless people at Paypal.\n\nSo the fraudster stole my money and listed more of these phones to rip other people off. Unbelievable. Now the only option left is to appeal the case. If i lose i will try a chargeback or take Paypal to court to recover my money.\n\nPaypal let\'s fraudsters get away with scams. They whole system is open to cheating.
