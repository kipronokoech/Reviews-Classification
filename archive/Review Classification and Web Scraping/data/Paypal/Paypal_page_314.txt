I brought my case to the attention of their manager and it was just as useless, a complete waste of my precious time! I am thoroughly astounded by the lack of professionalism in which my case has been handled. Paypal does not protect buyers, it protects scammers and sellers who give misleadig information about their services. After trusting Paypal for so many years, I have just lost my trust in them and I will no longer trust their bogus customer protection policy. I will stop using their services straight away. Please do not use their services, use your credit cards instead and the issuers of your credit cards will refund your money.

I have proof of this together with hundreds of positive feedbacks, the buyer is a scammer, a thief and a fraud whilst PayPal support this.

I'll share my latest experience here as a warning. I highly recommend that you do not use Paypal but instead (in the UK), go with a trusted high street bank with a track record of looking after their customers as Paypal DO NOT.\nThe story: An Ebay buyer opened a fraud claim with their bank after purchasing a bed from me for over £300. They claimed someone had used their card to buy the bed. In any other 'real world' situation, it would have been the responsibility of the bank to return the money to the buyer; it's covered by insurance. Despite the fact that I had no involvement in the fraud, Paypal took the money back from me. I have no bed and no money (I'm unemployed, and really need that money) and have wasted hours trying to get it back.\nThe financial ombudsman supports my case but that doesn't mean I will get my money back.\nOne of the biggest problems I experienced was with Paypal communications. It's clear that the people I interacted with did not fully understand English - this caused a lot of problems when I was trying to explain my side of the story. (Part of me also wonders if Paypal coaches the customer service team to deliberately misunderstand communications in order to stop customers from complaining). Examples include customer services asking me several times for information I'd already supplied. They didn't read my messages, when I spoke to them on the phone they were constantly misunderstanding things I said.\nAll-in-all, their inability to understand what I was saying led to them concluding that the case was not in my favour. (Even though the case wasn't against me!)\nFrom what I've read on-line, 1000s of people have had similar Ebay/Paypal experiences. Because of this, I am looking into taking legal action against Paypal. If anyone reads this and wants to raise a similar case against Paypal, get in touch. I think it's time companies like this (who don't pay their taxes), are held to account.", 'review_date': '2021-06-24', 'review_time': '15:46:55', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
