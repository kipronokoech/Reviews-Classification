I explained that with Amazon they take a picture as proof of delivery and that I would appreciate a proof of delivery but they have none. Paypal has terrible customer service and I will cancel all my Pay pal credit as soon as they let me cancel.

I appreciate that times are somewhat difficult at the moment given the circumstances but PayPal has made it extremely hard for customers to reach them over important issues. They have disabled their phone lines which is so unhelpful. The only option is to then send a message through the message centre, PayPal state they will respond within a few hours, more like a few days if you’re lucky! Not only that but you will be pushed from pillar to post and nothing will ever get resolved! I have had to constantly explain the issue over and over again to several different advisors who have been worse than useless and don’t really know what they’re doing. They keep passing the buck, making false promises and nothing ever happens. Some of the advisors are rude and abrupt in their tone and not once have I been offered an apology for their lack of response/false information. I was promised a call back and that never happened. Another advisor promised to update me within 72 hours and that never happened. They keep telling me the issue needs to be passed over to a specialist department which should have already happened ages ago, then they tell me they cannot help and to contact eBay - eBay then tell me to contact PayPal. Totally shocking from such a large company! If you don’t have enough stress in your life already and you think you might want some, contact PayPal because that’s the only thing they’re good at - causing people stress and allowing them to lose their money even though they purport to have a 180 day money back guarantee!

I opened up a resolution ticket for the first time ever this month. I used PayPal to make a purchase of a Radio Flyer Red Wagon for my son from CHAKROS, which turned out to be a fraudulent business. PayPal stated that since CHAKROS sent me a UPS delivery confirmation, which traces back to a package that only weighed 0.2 lb and was delivered to an address in our area, I wouldn’t receive my money back...the red wagon must way close to 40 lb. Incidentally, I took screen shots of the whole transaction, but PayPal closed the ticket. Here is a company that is supposed to protect from fraudulent businesses, but seems to actually support them by not doing due diligence in making sure those businesses are legit. Looks like PayPal is only concerned about profiting from financial transactions, not at all concerned with making sure fraudulent businesses aren’t taking advantage of their consumer members.', 'review_date': '2020-06-21', 'review_time': '14:30:47', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
