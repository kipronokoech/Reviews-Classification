I was not able to reach anyone on the phone and there is no email to email Paypal, I could only reach them through my account, which was no longer in my control. The automated Paypal 'customer service' line did not provide an option to speak to a rep and it said the offices were closed, despite it being in the time that the offices were stated to be open, this went on for several days. I eventually was able to regain control over my account by obtaining my phone number again (which was ported out) and then reset my Paypal password. I still got nowhere with the online message system. I made numerous requests to speak to a rep and for my account history. I got variations of the same generic messages back each time and often times my questions were just ignored. One time I was given the same customer service number again where it was impossible to speak to a human still. Other times I was told not to worry as the transactions were canceled, despite me explaining each time that I wanted the history of the attempted transactions for the police fraud file that was opened. I just looked through the message thread and there were 8 instances I requested the history and then numerous more times when I explained I wanted to speak to someone over the phone. This has been happening over the last week of me trying each day to get information and to speak to someone in regards to the $21000 of unauthorized transactions, I am no further ahead than when I started. It has been the only business that I have not been able to speak to (I was able to reach my bank, phone provider, the credit card company etc) and Paypal have not even answered my questions regarding if they will do any follow up in relation to the illegal charges. I have had no recourse in this situation and if I had known this would be the case I would have canceled my account long ago and not put myself at this risk. My phone provider has told me that for persons whose numbers are ported out by hackers that Paypal is the first place they check (so they can reset your password using your phone number). Given the very poor communication I have had from Paypal I am no longer comfortable trusting any of my transactions with their service and would caution others as well.", 'review_date': '2020-08-05', 'review_time': '12:34:11', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

I was told there is nothing they can do because I received the item it was just not as described and the seller gave me a chance to return the item. I explained to him this is the second time that this has happen where I order one thing and got something I did not order and cost less than the amount I paid. I explained that I think these scammer websites has found a loop hole around with PayPal. And we use PayPal because they have always went to bat for their customers. Up until today I would only purchase from websites if they had a paypal option. But after a long day of getting no help from PayPal I donâ€™t think I will be trusting them in the future. These scammer sites have found a loop hole of making you think youâ€™re getting one thing but what you actually gets is something not worth what you paid for! And they know to return it back to them will cost more then you actually paid for the item so why bother and they win and PayPal does absolutely nothing about it because they states you receive the item it was just not as describe and the seller gave you the option to return!!! ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡never again', 'review_date': '2020-08-04', 'review_time': '20:44:00', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
