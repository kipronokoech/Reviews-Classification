To turn Balance Manager back on, log in to your PayPal account, go to your Profile, click "My money", and update the "Balance Manager" section.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nI check my online banking via Payoneer. It shows the a deposit as PayPal XX-011028 for amount of $244.57, with the transaction fee included. This is from the transfer on the 24th @ $247.04.\n\nThere is a discrepancy on the email and online banking.\n\nPayPal says the money isn\'t transferred.\n\nMy online banking shows it is.\n\nAnd my linked account is automatically removed from PayPal.\n\nI receive an email from Payoneer yesterday morning at 04:55am which says my bank account, and Mastercard are frozen, linked to company Wirecard AG. So what\'s happened is, soon after I transfer the money from PayPal to my bank account, it\'s frozen.\n\nMy money transferred\n\nTo my account\n\nTurns to a black hole\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nOn these discrepancies, I put it to the test by heading on to Galaxy Mall 3 where there is a BCA ATM. I go ahead with a withdrawal using my Mastercard. The ATM screen shows "your card is not usable any more". I take a photo of the ATM screen. I take a video of me putting the card in the ATM, going for the withdrawal, and the same message appearing on the ATM screen.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nOn a return visit to the mall, I head for the Ranch Market Foodmall. I go for a reattempt to bill my card for my groceries. The Visa / Mastercard terminal shows "do not honor". My Mastercard neither works at an ATM, nor when going for the chip reader. I take a photos, and a video of the terminal rejecting my purchase with my card in the reader.\n\nIt\'s confirmed.\n\nI cannot withdraw my money, nor make any purchases with my card.\n\nThe email from Payoneer says Wirecard is insolvent on Thursday. The Visa / Mastercard terminal device is linked to the same company as the one linked to my frozen funds. It says Wirecard on the terminal screen, and sticker on the side of the unit - the terminal is operational at the grocery store.\n\nThis doesn\'t explain why my money transferred to my account is inaccessible, and the Visa / Mastercard Wirecard terminal is in use, in the field, without being recalled or frozen too.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nI have the above-mentioned photos and videos with me that cannot be added to a review on Trustpilot.', 'review_date': '2020-06-28', 'review_time': '05:32:02', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
