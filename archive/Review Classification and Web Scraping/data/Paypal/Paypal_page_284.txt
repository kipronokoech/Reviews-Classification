{'platform': 'Paypal', 'id': '6130d25b9c391649d850521b', 'stars': 1, 'title': 'Completely untrustful company', 'message': 'There were numerous problems yesterday when I tried to transfer money from my own bank account to PayPal. Paypal asked a dozen times for SMS, email and other verifications. I verified myself and transfers several times with bank IDs.\n\nAfter making the SEPA transfer from the bank account to PayPal, the money left the account but did not appear in PayPal.\n\nAfter several hours, I got in touch with a chat service where the issue didn’t work out. I was then called from PayPal (English only, no service available in my own language) and again asked for multiple verifications (account number, SMS verification and personal information), despite PayPal calling me.\n\nPaypal said there is a security risk when a customer with their bank IDs transfers money from their own bank account to the PayPal service and they need to verify the correctness of the transfer (despite the bank identification).\n\nPayPal claims the problem was with the Chrome browser I was using (?).\n\nFinally, today the money appeared in my PayPal account. PayPal is displayed as the payer of the money, so PayPal has taken over the money for the duration of the check.\nI do not understand the nature of the check because I paid the money with my bank ID from my bank account to my PayPal account.\n\nToday I tried to pay for a purchase in an online store (Proshop.com). Payment for the purchase was suspended 21 times. I received an SMS verification request 11 times, 2 times I was asked to change my password and despite that the payment was not successful. Each time there was a message "We are unable to complete your purchase right now, return to the merchant page and try again"\n\nAfter 48 minutes and more than 20 attempts, I tried to contact the chat service. The chat service did not work at all. I called PayPal. Again, service in English only. PayPal explained that again there is a security risk and payment cannot be made. Said I could try to pay again after 72 hours.\n\nAccording to PayPal, they can’t say where the fault is, they just explained that it’s a security risk.\n\nNo need to explain that no transaction waits 72 hours for a pending payment transaction (ProShop waits 10 minutes)\n\nThe product was not purchased.\n\nNow I tried to transfer money from PayPal back to my bank account without success. PayPal\'s statement: "There was a problem. We weren\'t able to transfer the money to the bank right now."\n\nI am now unable to transfer my own money from my PayPal account to my own bank account. The account is the same from which I transferred the money to PayPal.\n\nPayPal now has over € 1,000 of money stuck, and there is no information on when they can be transferred back to my own bank account.\n\nPayPal is a completely invalid system. Transferring money from your own bank account with bank IDs is a "security risk", paying for purchases in a large online store is not possible because it is a security risk, and your own money cannot be transferred back to your own bank account.\n\n\nI strongly advise you to avoid using PayPal.', 'review_date': '2021-09-03', 'review_time': '08:43:45', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

It took almost a year to withdraw the money which was in my account. They don’t care about their customers at all.\n\nPaypal can easily suspend your account and when they suspend your account, they will hold your money for 6 months from the day it got suspended, if you try to appeal it, they will make it worse for you. That 6 months can become 12 months. They are very scary people to deal with. Even though you try to explain your situation clearly, they won’t take any action in behalf of you. They say that they will review your account and it won’t happen.\n\nA big NO for people who are thinking of opening an account with paypal.

I had to say excuse what every time bc it didn’t make any sense. So at this point I get rude bc I am so frustrated and tell her to get me a manager. The manager then gets on the phone and repeats the same BS the first person said but this time tells me my acct was limited bc “I am either under the age of 18 or I opened up a second PayPal account”. I am 38 years old I would have no need at all to have a second acct. They will not give me any other information except that sentence. I then asked to file an appeal or dispute she said ok then gave me a ticket number and got me off the phone said they will email me the verdict. I have had my PayPal account over 15 years so it is a little ridiculous that they would all of a sudden claim I am under 18. If they are trying to say I opened another account then show me proof!!! No one can show or tell me anything. They are holding funds for 180 days.
