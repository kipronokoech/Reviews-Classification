The company has breached every single contract (failed to deliver). This company is a complete fraud company in today’s online world and must be black listed.\nWe ask Paypal. How the customers are protected who settled some projects and the delivery date is been stretched above six months and the customer doesn’t get the product which they paid for. This means there is no payment protection to the customer whose payments went above 180 days. The fraud company just walks away with the hard earn money which the customer paid them. The company is based overseas and nothing can be done.\nWhy Paypal can’t do anything? You guys are still helping the fraud company getting them money from the other customers who are not aware about this company. The payment we made to them is not a small payment. The various payments total goes above 30k USD. There are thousands of reviews about this company online. Every single customer has declared them fraud and cheater.\nLast week we had conversation with Mr Philip. Paypal Senior UK dispute Department manager based in New Castle. We explained him the entire case and he mentioned the payments are above 180 days therefore Paypal can’t do anything.\nWe request Paypal to please reopen our dispute cases. The money we paid to this fraud company is hard earned. I worked nearly 16-18 hours every day to earn this money and paid them to grow my business. We got thousand of emails which Mr Philip from Paypal asked me to forward at the email address. Received automatic email saying I won’t receive any response to this email.\n\nResponse from Paypal : Hi Madhur, I understand your frustration in this matter. We can only offer protection on claims that are filed within the 180-day timeframe.\nI am very sorry that we cannot accept claims that are opened outside the180 days. Every claim that is made will be noted as a case on the\nseller's account and if we receive multiple cases against a seller we will investigate this and take steps against the seller.\nIf needed we can block the account and do not let them use our service. However, we will not be able to refund any of the payments\nif they are outside the 180 days timeframe.\nI apologize for any inconvenience but there really is nothing else we can do. -Dian", 'review_date': '2018-05-28', 'review_time': '14:34:47', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

I contact PayPal multiple times but every single time redirect me to someone else. I have been transferred to different departments for a month almost. Their resolution center is a joke altogether. In the end I had to reverse my transfer with the help of my bank. This action resulted in PayPal putting my balance into negative and forcing me to pay back, otherwise threathening to sue.
