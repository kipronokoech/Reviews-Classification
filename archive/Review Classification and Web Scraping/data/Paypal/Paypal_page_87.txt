At least, not anymore. I have filed a claim recently because the seller from who I bought several items, didn’t send me the complete order, so I asked my parcial payment back. To be specific, the order was purchased from AliExpress, it was the first time I buy from this website which is a total mess, they are slow, the sellers never respond, the customer service always say they will help that they treat you like god when it’s the contrary, they never solve anything! They even can’t speak or understand English well，they do no care if you get the products or not, they just care to steal your money. I thought PayPal will be responding my claim because that was the reason I used it, but I’m very surprised that they are doing anything possible to not respond the my lose. It’s a really ridiculous and exhausted process just for $10.00. My conclusion is, I’ll must avoid PayPal from now on and use another payment method. Why give PayPal the chance to earn your money when they don’t deserve it? Any supplier that doesn’t care of your satisfaction, doesn’t deserve to earn money from you. If we all do the same, the world will be different & things will change for sure!', 'review_date': '2023-03-21', 'review_time': '07:37:37', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

PayPal use synchrony bank. It’s funny but it’s a fraud PayPal credit allowed synchrony bank to use the name logo and the same color. I purchase Breitling watch on eBay Page for it on PayPal made a mistake paid for that with PayPal credit. The watch is a fake watch. I contact eBay they required me to ship the item back to the seller I did the seller refuse the package hey pal we’re not going to issue me a refund since I paid with PayPal credit synchrony bank don’t want to be found me the money because the seller have a policy of no refund. But it’s sad PayPal have bio protection plan but since I pay with PayPal credit I cannot get the benefits of six months by protection plan. So just think about it the only way you can pay on the eBay is to PayPal PayPal pushing PayPal credit but when you come to a customer service they’re washing their hands out of it so you have three different company working together. In plain English organize crime with the license to kill I would never purchase again on eBay and definitely not using PayPal and 100% for sure synchrony bank will never gonna get me as a customer', 'review_date': '2023-03-21', 'review_time': '05:35:34', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
