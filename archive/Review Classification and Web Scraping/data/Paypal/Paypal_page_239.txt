I was fortunate enough to win £250.00 in their draw on Sunday 4th December 2021 but only notified on Tuesday 7th December after I had managed to use some of these funds on purchases. Then it went horribly wrong.\nOne of my purchases did not utilise the full funds available and to make matters worse Paypal did not authorise the payment which meant it was technically stuck. As I did not want to pay twice, I had to get the transaction cancelled and it is still showing on my account. To add insult to insury, since 7th December 2021, I have made 4 phone calls and set up a useless webchat with Paypal to a) cancel the transaction their end and b) find out why I have no access to the remaining prize money of £142.15. Apparently, it is a 'technical error' their end which, now a month later is still ongoing. The end date to use these funds was 31st December but someone in an overseas call centre informed me once the 'issue' had been resolved they would honour the remaining amount after this date. It is inconceivable in this age of technology that it has been a huge task to get my funds credited to my account. Excuse after excuse but no real explanation why they messed up.\nCustomer Service has been a joke, not a funny one. I received a 'final response' yesterday advising that they claimed my problem was solved and that the so called advisor had resolved the issue back in December. Clearly no one bothered to read properly or just brushed my credit under the proverbial carpet hoping I would just call it quits. No chance. You offer a prize, you need to honour it.\nIm not sure if anyone else has had issues with these so called prizes but hopefully Resolver will assist and after that Paypal will not be my 'go to' for payments., and I will be cancelling my account. They have no UK Customer Service and the ridiculous platitudes from their unprofessional and seemingly untrained staff does not help placate an already irritating situation where they appear to be reading off cue cards and not answering any questions but just telling you what they think you want to hear without actually listening to what the problem is.\nThere is another word apart from fiasco to describe how Paypal has dealt with this and if this is the case then I will be reporting them to the Financial Ombudsman.\nPaypal need to listen to their customers.
