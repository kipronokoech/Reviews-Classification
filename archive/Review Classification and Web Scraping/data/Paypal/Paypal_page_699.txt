PP gave him a return-address where he could send the product to. So he did, and PP paid the shippingcosts after he showed the receipt. Then the same package got returned: wrong address.\n\nHe contacted PP again about the returned package because of the wrong address PP gave him. He sent photos of the package and the message of the courier of a non-existing return-address.\n\nPP asked for the receipt of the shipping costs again. He answered that PP already received the receipt, otherwise they would not have paid him back the shipping costs of the package. After having had contact with a handful of different PP-employees about the same dispute, PP no longer replies. Dead end. Bye 80 USD, and bye PayPal.\n\nLater he finds out that WISH and PayPal are big buddies...\n---\nReliabity was the reason for me to use PP, and even though a PP- fee was needed for some websites, it was still worth to pay extra for PP\'s guaranteed support.
