An eBayer paid the amount due at 08:12 (friendly email from PayPal) and at 8:14 Email from PayPal that my account is permanently limited!! So in chock I called the help service, and to my surprise, I got someone on the phone. I did ask her what is happening, she responded that PayPal decided to permanently limit my account. When I asked the reason she said she can't see why. She is making an appeal which it will take 5 days.\n\n1- How much is the chance that this is related to the payment from eBay?\n2- How are the chances that I ever see the money that is the Balance?\n3-Howcome PayPal, without any warning, limits an account?\n4- How come it is possible that PayPal takes control of our money without giving us a reason?\n5- the claim it is for my security, but how come I exactly feel the opposite feeling I just lost money?\n6- Am I ever be able to use a PayPal account?\n7- What can we do to avoid such situations?\n\nI have been using PayPal more than 5 years and never had problems, I am confident that I did nothing wrong, and therefore this problem will find a fast solution. If not, one has to ask itself the seriousness of the service offered from PayPal.\n\nThank you", 'review_date': '2021-05-23', 'review_time': '15:24:52', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

They refuse to verify the account after we have tried multiple bank accounts and cards, social security, literally putting in our bank account username and password as a "fast bypass", and then still require a verification on an old phone number that paypal stubbornly insists on sending (so a phone # is good enough proof that I\'m a person, but my literal intricate bank account name, password, and card numbers associated are not? Makes 100% sense), and you would think, "Hey! I\'ll just call them and have this resolved in half an hour, maybe an hour tops!". Wrong to the tenth degree. Waited on hold for 40 minutes just for the phone to be hung up on us, still no word from their help center, and now it is going to hurt my girlfriend\'s reputation as she is trying to process 2 orders for people that have paid days ago at the time I\'m typing this. Where the hell is the accountability? Needless to say, this company should have no f***ing reason why they\'re worth $50,000,000,000 in 2021. Yes, 50 billion. What the hell is their overhead? Some computers and phones they aren\'t even paying attention to? Maybe their service is so subpar, there is just thousands of people in front of us with the same kind of complaints.
