My client makes the first payment on it and PayPal holds 2/3 of it because it's above some kind of threshold of what I've been making recently. Now I have to get my client to go into their account and find a button to press to confirm I am legit and release the funds.\nI can understand trying to protect folks from piracy, but just by basing it on how much money I've been making recently?

I had purchased from Marks and Spencer, paid via PayPal thinking that gave me buyer protection. Marks and Spencer delivered my package while I was away for the weekend by dumping it in the street outside my house. Not for the first time too, except this time it wasn’t there when I returned home from my trip. I only found out it had been delivered because they eventually sent tracking info and a photo showing it dumped in the street outside my house. I took it up with PayPal, pointing out that they never delivered it to me, they never attempted to arrange a redelivery and they just left it in the street. PayPal decided that this was fine and that dumping parcels in the street is of course a perfectly acceptable form of delivery (who knew?!). Well that doesn’t work for me and now I’m down £44. So goodbye PayPal, you’ve been a huge disappointment and I won’t use you again now that I know your buyers protection means nothing and you’re there to back the seller.', 'review_date': '2022-06-26', 'review_time': '11:15:12', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
