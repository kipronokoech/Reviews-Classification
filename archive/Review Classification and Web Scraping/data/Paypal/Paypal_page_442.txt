A global company like PayPal you would have thought would have a reputable reputation since many platforms use it, well my own experience and all the forums I have read say different - coincidence? I think not. After having a smooth run in terms of selling on PayPal for years, today they have decided to close my account. I don’t want to worry people but I have nearly £1K sat in the account, which they are of course entitled to keep for up to 180 days! After sitting on hold for 40 minutes looking for an explanation I finally got through to an advisor. As lovely as they were they provided no clear cut answers and a very vague explanation only that they viewed the account as ‘high risk’. Unfortunately, when asked why it was ‘high risk’ ironically they ‘didn’t know’. I offered them the alternative that I provide additional documentation and explanation to the already verified papers I had already provided, but I was met with a simple ‘we will get back to you if we need anything else’. During the current climate this is extremely damaging to my small business, as it would be I’m sure with many others. With it being peak season the inhibiting of access to crucial capital is not ideal ATALL! They have absolutely no interest in helping, and they only act out of self-interest.
