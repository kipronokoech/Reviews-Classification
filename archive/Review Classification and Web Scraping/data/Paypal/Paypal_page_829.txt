They only have an info email, no phone number, or customer service information.\n\nAlthough, I have to applaud him/them for putting so much effort into this scam. I wonder how many stressed out buyers they have scammed so far.\n\nI am very disappointed in PayPal, I have been using this service for 8 years without a hitch.Even if I am clearly correct and am entitled to my money back, paypal will find a way to deny me.paypal knows this is impossible and will make me feel like I am at fault for not following your impossible demands.There are so many impossible mandates to comply with, to honest people like us,it would be the looser of the process every time.\n\nEither way, there\'s fraud going on or not,since some scams are so well organized and convincing and the people behind so difficult to catch it is still inevitable to spreading awareness and giving information to hopefully help others avoid falling victim to it.', 'review_date': '2017-12-23', 'review_time': '03:00:47', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

Basically it always made me feel safe knowing they were the only ones having hold of my credit cards data.\n\nBut just recently something 'strange' happened: after so many years and thousands of money spent through Paypal , I made a purchase of an antique art book through Abebooks which I wanted like crazy, at a very reasonable price. On Abebooks check out I made the mistake of choosing Paypal as a payment method. I was forwarded to Paypal but when I clicked the pay button I got a notification that my transaction looked suspicious (!!!!!) and that it would be left pending until Paypal decided that it was ok! That was a small shock for me , didn't expect that, first time with Paypal for a small amount of money.\n\nI felt very frustrated since the pending transaction would be cleared after 3 days! I feared that the book trader might then cancel the purchase and I would lose that book...and the ordeal continued once I decided I wanted to contact Paypal's customer service! What a labyrinth, specially designed to get you nowhere!!! Spent so much time trying to figure out how and when I almost got there I kept getting a notification that my name and surname fields were incorrect (the same ones that they were on their database since 2002!).\n\nThen I tried to cancel the pending transaction from my account so that I could go back to Abebooks and use a credit card directly. No! Their system would not allow that..\n\nAnyway, after 3 days I got a message that my transaction was ok and the trader got his money...what can I say? Since this happened I decided I would stop using Paypal and do this only when is necessary...\n\nIs sad when a huge company makes millions out of its customers but at the same time does not care to provide the proper environment for good communication and right give and take...", 'review_date': '2017-12-15', 'review_time': '13:28:16', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
