A BBS (bulletin board style) support system is in place. You cannot call or chat live. Let me repeat that: A financial institution that cannot give you live support! Terrible, especially because most of their products will ABSOLUTELY need live support all of the time!\n\nProducts: Pretty much all of the paypal services are broken or just plain terrible to begin with. For example: Debit cards associated with your account. You will have constant security denials. This means that you will NOT be able to use your available funds in your account (or a authorized bank account) to make purchase very often. It will be denied for "security" reasons (that they will refuse to explain to you) and you cannot contact anyone about it live.\n\nSecurity: The debit/credit card authorization is the worst I have ever seen. Repeatedly, I have had tens of thousands in available funds: Security fraud protection denial. Here is the situation EVERY time:\n\nPurchase less than $500 from a national chain (Walmart, Best Buy, Newegg, etc.) actual stores this happened at. Both IN store and ONLINE. Purchase was made and meets all requirements (name address etc.) with more than sufficient funds and no daily limit applies.\n\nSecurity fraud triggers without warning or explanation. Delivery (in the case of online) was the established HOME address. In order for this to be fraudulent: Myself, and my family would need to be kidnapped in our home and held hostage until the items purchased were delivered to my home in 3-5 days time!\n\nDoes that even sound feasible to you? Not a strange address in another state or country. Home. Not a purchase in another state in a physical store. A store down the street where I live where I shop every week.\n\nI no longer use Paypal.
