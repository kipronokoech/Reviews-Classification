Both were friends. so I know exactly who they are and wanted to support my business with their first orders - won’t get that money for 6 months.\n\nI asked what the reason was and they refuse to answer. I provided more information, social media pages, my personal shop, my Etsy to prove I had an actual business and raised a complaint so someone would talk to me.\n\nThey refused my complaint (can you do that?) and said they’ve revolved the issue (well they haven’t)\n\nSo yeah. My brand new business can never have PayPal for unknown reasons. Oh and my first 2 ever orders I won’t get the money for 6 months but according to all forums I’ve read it could take longer.\n\nNow I’m going to have to refund the orders which have been posted, lose the fees and get them to pay through bank and pay another fee.

That is because, PayPal get a cut from each transactions made. I know, I thought it was just a rumor as well, until it actually happened to me! I am so devastated because I needed every penny in my bank account! I disputed the unauthorized charge but PayPal denied my dispute saying it was a valid charge and you will not be given a chance for rebuttal or open another dispute. That's how they get you. Sadly, once that is charged to your debit, it's almost impossible to get your money back, so take it from my experience; NEVER, under any circumstances, use PayPal. STAY AWAY FROM PAYPAL if you care for your hard earned money. So far, I'm liking Venmo. Aside from no fees or any charges besides what you spent, it's also easy to use.
