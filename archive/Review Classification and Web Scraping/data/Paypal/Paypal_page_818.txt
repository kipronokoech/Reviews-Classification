I now have the item back damaged and not in original condition. One of paypal employees even said to me over the phone this should never have been allowed to go ahead but the buyer had returned the item within 30 min of there decision. so then when i opened claim for damaged item that was returned to me it took the whole of 12 hours for then to decide to side with the buyer so again i was in same postion and now there threatening me with debt collection for balance on paypal which is nearly £300, Again when they called to chase balance i explained situation girl said that's not right let me see if i can help re opened case sent all pics clearly showing damage and difference then next day closed it with same decision lol so whats even the point What a bunch of inconsiderate morons there customer service is awful and there seller protection is a lot of rubbish they seriously need to take a look at policies.
