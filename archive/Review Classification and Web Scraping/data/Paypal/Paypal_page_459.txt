I recently purchased a ‘designer’ coat via eBay however when it was delivered it was apparent this was a fake item. I had spent a lot of money on the coat and the seller wasn’t responding. I raised a claim in the resolution centre and in the end escalated to PayPal as the seller would not accept a return for a refund. PayPal sent regular updates of the case and estimated resolution times. PayPal closed the case in my favour and issued a refund after I returned the coat (even though the seller didn’t confirm he had received the return despite sent on a guaranteed next day service and signed for). Thank you PayPal for sorting this issue for me.', 'review_date': '2020-11-13', 'review_time': '20:19:37', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

I have been gravely mistaken. They are pretty useless againts online sellers from China. My complaint was active and then out of nowhere the status changed to "case closed". After 3 months of exchange of communications the status changed to without getting the refund. I can only talk about my experience on buying from Chinese sellers. Never had any disputes with local purchases or known sellers before so I could not comment on that. Chinese sellers appears to have significant leverage on Paypal. If you are thinking of relying on Paypal when buying from China, think again as they as very bias to chinese sellers and because of that Chinese sellers could be very confident to deliver their worst products and there is nothing you can do about it. Returning the product back to China would be a bad decision too as you would pay for the return shipment (even though it says buyers would not be liable for cost of returns) but the seller in all likelyhood will say that they\'re product got broken in transit therefore no refund. Never trust any online sellers connected to Marul Company Limited. It is a UK registered company but if you dig deep they are owned by a chinese company. They are trading under different MANY online names but if you go to their "About us" or "Contact Us" links, you will find the name of their company, if it says Marul Company Limited, just close the browser and look somewhere else. I noticed that they removed their name in one, Ouskyt. So if you didn\'t see the name of the company, move away too. If you see the name of the company, visit companieshouse website and check the "People with significant control" section and if you see Chinese registered company, move away too.', 'review_date': '2020-11-13', 'review_time': '11:26:28', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
