Usually they do all right if you don\'t ask them to do anything extra. If they mess up, if a vender or seller messes up, and PP has to levitate beyond the couple of canned options they have decided are the only possibilities of problems you might be having, expect mediocre to terrible or non-existent service.\nI tried to respond to PP\'s shaky decision on a dispute today. There\'s no way. PP\'s number 1 goal is not to provide good service; rather it is to make sure they don\'t actually deal with you. You are directed to handle everything online. Per the usual, they want you to "chat" with a robot, who has been programmed by a moron to provide a simple answer to the only four basic questions PP wants you to have (true of all their canned "help"). If you have another issue, you\'re directed to head back over to Help. There\'s a "Call us" option. I did, and this morning I waited 2 hours and 15 minutes, listening to their canned spiel (much of which is about going online to solve your own problems...snort) about 90 times before I hung up. Their number 1 goal was achieved there. The chat-bot said I could choose "Email us", except there is no option there for that. The other option is go back to the Resolution Center. The only way to communicate with them is via the case #, which they have closed without hearing all of your part of things. So if you would like to add that info, there is noooo way to do it. No phone, no chat, no email...just PP\'s BS of pretending they offer customer support.
