I contacted customer service with the attachment of print screen where is the problem, they just\nrepeated to send me the add money instruction or asked me to wait for 72 hours or security issue to block money transfer... blablabla....\n\nI told them I have entered the security code but still back to the link bank account page. I have warned them there is a bug in the system and they should contact IT. However, the agents just repeated to send me the add money instruction that I can find it on paypal.\n\nFinally, after 3 days to receive their garbage replies, I gave up and the problem is still there forever.\n\nWorst customer service and switch to other epayment method.

Paypal is a scam organization. A corrupt, large-scaled embodiment of a real-life thief! It should be banned in every country. It should be scraped from the surface of the earth.
