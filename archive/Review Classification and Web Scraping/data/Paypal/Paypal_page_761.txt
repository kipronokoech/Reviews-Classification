BUT my friend has now a dispute with paypal as he basically lost EUR 1000 because of them. He called them already 3 times (talking with them for like an hour each time), he followed exactly the steps in order to solve the issue and they still make his life miserable. We are not talking about 10 and 15 euros but eur 1000!! All he wants is to transfer HIS money from his old paypal account to his new paypal account (which by the way was created after instructions by the Paypal itself while they don't give him access now to his old account). They are ridiculous (I was there during one of their phone conversation). Can you believe that we are in 2019 and they are asking him to send documents by fax?? FAX!! In 2019. We found a way to send them by fax via a website but still nothing. They even hang up the phone to him. I know i should tell the story from the beginning but is really too long. But trust me, Paypal seems to be the worst! I'm also thinking to close my account and find another company to work with.", 'review_date': '2019-02-28', 'review_time': '18:41:56', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

Spoke with Marie ID number 1671455 and Ronald ID number 28034 and both of them were just ridiculous. I wasted about 1 hour of my time over a small fee that was mistakenly charged on my account. Marie was the absolute worst - she kept talking over me and kept reading me the policies instead of listening to my concerns. Instead, the only option that Marie kept repeating over and over again was to cancel the transaction and start all over again. This is utterly ridiculous - when my bank mistakenly charge me a fee, I call customer service and they refund it instead of making me reverse all the transactions with the different parties involved. As a courtesy sake, Paypal should at least assist there customers on these issues.
