I am very saded in the way they treated me and still today. $180 of my hard earned money was taken and was not returned.

It tells me not to send the items but at the same time the guy is asking me every day where it is or whats going on, Most pointless holding system i\'ve ever seen.\n\nAnother thing, If someone sends you idk $500 for something and they end up charging back which puts your account in -$500 even though you\'re disputing the negative balance because you sent the item etc paypal EVEN WHEN THE DISPUTE IS STILL OPEN! asks for the $500 negative balance to be paid and start threatening you with collectors which makes no sense to me, Maybe thats why you call it "dispute and resolution centre" you know so people can resolve scammers charging back? And your answer is to not help the person its to threaten them, Well for one if you ever send collectors to my house they would be leaving on their backs and two, I ain\'t paying for someones wrongful doing.....They shouldn\'t be disputing so when i win the dispute everything is fine...why tf you sending collectors etc? Joke of a company and cant stand the way you operate and think.\n\nIts such a easy way to scam people its a joke, Someone pays you money then chargeback then paypal make you pay FOR THEM CHARGING BACK WRONGFULLY! Best way to troll people its a joke.\n\nNobody should put large funds through paypal, Nobody should keep your card linked to paypal (have mine so i can transfer money but they cant take money) If you have your card linked to your paypal then you\'re stupid and heres why :\n\n1 - If your account is hacked then good luck\n2- If someone charges back wrongfully and puts your account in negative balance then they\'ll just bill your card for the negative balance you didn\'t even cause\n\n3- the protection they offer is rubbish so if you think you can rely on that to help then good luck also!\n\nSo if you want to keep your card linked and then one day someone wrongfully charges back and your account is in negative balance don\'t cry when PayPal dont even ask and just take the amount from your card :clap:\n\nThey\'ve also been holding over £2500 from me thats mine, pretty much someone purchased web development from me and charged back to try keep the money but obviously i ended up winning, After banks closed it in my favour PayPal kept and is still holding my £2500 (clearly for interest because their greedy as fu#k) and won\'t release it for another month..its been almost 3 months now and they dont care it damages your business. Honestly, these crooks need closing down.\n\nUpdate: Ended up sending collectors to my house for money that wasn\'t my problem, Someone charged back over £2500 in web development and i was proving this all and the BANK and his BANK closed it in my favour seeing PayPal was useless so ended up getting both banks on a 3 way call, So i even got a manager to prove to some useless PayPal support guy that the case was in fact closed and closed in my favour, But pp send collectors anyway who tried to jump over my gate so i dragged him down the street and they never returned.\n\nThe best part too, So when i asked paypal where is this money you\'ve got froze they repeated to me "What money? what do you mean?" And they kept telling me they don\'t know what money i\'m talking about and how they don\'t know where it is even though we knew 100% they had it, Was funny because i had a bank manager on the call with me and he heard them and told them straight, Paypals support guy all of a sudden found it on the system and knew where it was...how strange? Cleary was hoping for me to give up or forget about it, Complete snakes and 1000% need closing down or sueing beyond belief.\n\nAnyone who still uses Paypal is an idi#t, Do you want PayPal taking money or sending collectors when someone wrongfully charges back? Do you want money froze in your account while they grab interest? Then sure use paypal.', 'review_date': '2019-04-22', 'review_time': '13:19:30', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
