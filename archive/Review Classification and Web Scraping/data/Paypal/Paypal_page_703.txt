I had a business doing almost 1,000,000 per year, several other companies, 5 pieces of property and I was worth over 5 million dollars.\n\nIn 1 day I lost almost everything. I had no money to my name, no job and no place to live. I owed out way to much to family members, and was left with Complex PTSD, depression, anxiety and was homeless.\nIt took a couple of years just to regain some of my self confidence and overcome some of the trauma I endured. I owe much of that to my family for knowing how to save a psychologically drowning person.\nAfter two and a half years I started back where my roots began, in retail, this time selling mostly online. It was a slow journey as I haven't fully recovered.\nI was using PayPal's merchant services, having been a loyal business customer for over 17 years. I have done well over 1 million dollars in transactions with PayPal over that time.\nThen in April 2019 without any notice I received this message on my PayPal account (Attachment A to the right).\nAn this is where it gets frightening. I have almost no money but what I did have was in my PayPal account $5414.78. Prior to PayPal limiting my account, I actually started to have hope again that I would be able to pull myself out of being homeless and grow my business.\nI called PayPal customer service multiple times and asked what happened and why they limited my account. After many many hours on the phone and escalating the calls, these three things became apparent:\nWe do not know why your account was limited, you will have to read the terms of use and try and figure it out by yourself.\nYou will be able to transfer your $5414.78 in 180 days.(I was told this by every PayPal representative)\nSend a letter to our legal department and they can tell you why your account was limited.\nI sent a certified letter explaining my situation to PayPal's legal department (Attachment B, USPS tracking #70190140000004162357 Signed by E8) and I waited. And waited.... No response from PayPal's legal department.\nIn mid September 2019 I again called PayPal. I once again was assured that on October 4th, 2019 I would be able to transfer my money into my bank account.\nI checked my PayPal account on October 2nd, 2019. I wanted to make sure that what EVERYONE from PayPal's customer service department had told me was true.\nThis time to my surprise On September 28th 2019 only a couple of days prior to me being able to transfer the money, PayPal had stolen all $5414.78 out of my account without any reasoning as to why. (Attachment C)\nI have spent way over 4 hours on the phone with PayPal's customer service. On October 2nd I was told that the AUP department would call me within 12 hours. And once again there was no call.\nI was again on the phone with PayPal's customer service: from Grey, to Gene #1296431, to Victoria #Q20041900 before being placed on a hold for an additional 30 minutes and then having Victoria hang up the call on me after being on the line for over 2 hours.\nEveryone of PayPal's customer service representatives said: PayPal took the $5414.78 out of my account and not one of them could tell me a reason for doing so. I received no notice, no reason, no call, no email, nothing as to why PayPal stole the $5414.78.\nUnfortunately I am still homeless and living in my truck working toward a solution were I can build myself and my business back up.\nI would love to say that PayPal has helped me out, but I can only state that PayPal Steals money from the homeless to enrich itself and does everything in its power to lie and have customers run in circles trying to find out why.", 'review_date': '2019-10-16', 'review_time': '01:27:32', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

I use PayPal regularly both as a buyer and an online seller. However, since PayPal has changed its 45 day refund policy for buyers and raised it up to 180 days the increase in 'Not as described' claims has jumped up markedly and I now am one of those sellers fallen victim to a very ignorant policy that PayPal endorses! I recently sold a headlamp and harness to a buyer who after being in possession of it for 93 days claimed it no longer worked and initiated a claim through PayPal as 'Not as described'. Despite contacting PayPal and Daniel Schulman (CEO) directly my protestations at this buyer's claim have been ignored and any question of belief only lies with the buyer. I tested the headlamp before listing it online and when it sold I tested it again before posting to make sure it was fully working as per the listing description. The buyer after 93 days returned a used and now broken product to me and I was forced by PayPal to issue a full refund. PayPal will NOT protect ANY seller and PayPal can NOT be trusted! Any item sold online with payment made through PayPal can be reclaimed by ANY buyer simply contacting PayPal and stating the item is 'Not as described'. Daniel Schulman is well aware of my situation as I published an open letter to him on Twitter. However, he's not interested nor is PayPal and sellers are sitting ducks online and are NOT trusted by PayPal and ignored. PayPal might help sellers with chargebacks and fake credit card purchases but when a seller sells an item to a buyer there is NO protection for that seller, even after 90 days. I will be trying to seek legal action against PayPal and try in any way to change the law in both the UK and EU, forcing PayPal to observe distance selling regulations. PayPal thinks it is above the law and this is not right.
