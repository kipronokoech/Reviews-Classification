I had a pair of trainers turn up that were the wrong size to what was advertised, and PayPal rejected that claim because apparently despite the fact they don't fit they aren't 'significantly different to what was sold'. They also then completely ignored my subsequent two requests for an appeal, not replying to my emails at all. More recently, I bought a gift set that was meant to contain a book and didn't, and that claim was also rejected because it apparently wasn't covered. PayPals buyer protection used to be one of its biggest selling points, but I see no use in using them now. Hopefully with losing the relationship with eBay and their massive stock market crash last year they won't be around for long.", 'review_date': '2023-03-18', 'review_time': '22:22:47', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
