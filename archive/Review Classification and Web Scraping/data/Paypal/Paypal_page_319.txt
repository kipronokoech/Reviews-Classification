But as it I needed it to sell on eBay, itâ€™s sister company, I just signed up. After a few sales on eBay, I was informed my Paypal account was suspended permanently. I am certain I did not breach any of their terms but its their policy not to provide the reason why they suspend your account. It is their policy to freeze your money for 180 days and worse after that, they do not actually allow you to close your account: Paypal keeps your personal data indefinitely including bank details and continue to send requests asking to update your debit card information. Legislation has totally failed us on governing the way this company operates. Its sad how so many offline and online companies and traders bend over backwards to make their customers happy - or at the least allow them to opt out - but Paypal is allowed operate on the fringe of legality.
