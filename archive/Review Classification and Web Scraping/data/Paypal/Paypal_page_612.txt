After this adolescent supporter resolved my mistake, he made me aware that I registered 3 years ago and was not of legal age at the time, and that he would then like to block my account. I tried to explain to him that I am now 20 years old and a little over 18 years old, he insisted on my mistake 3 years ago and thought I wanted to block my account now, what can you say, of course I am against the gentleman came and told him that if my account was blocked, I would never go to PayPal again and never make a transaction through PayPal.
