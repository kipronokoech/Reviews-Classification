The purchase was made May 14 online at the Mr. Porter website. I choose the payment via payment in 4 via my American Express . It’s the method I always use . When I realized the full amount, I immediately called PayPal . They were closed . Their online chat bot referred my to the portal . I checked cancel agreement. A few hours later when they opened , I called an cancelled on the telephone. Then I called the seller Mr. Porter . I cancelled twice . First with a rep, and then a manager . The manager confirmed the cancellation. I then called PayPal to confirm. PayPal told me I was good . But the money was from my debit card . That was rarely use my debit card . It’s always American Express due to their buyers protection . I underscored with PayPal the order was CANCELED. Much to my chagrin, the next day the took money via ACH from my bank. I filed multiple disputes with PayPal. I even had the seller CONFIRM the order was cancelled, never shipped , and never delivered. Yet papal continues to play games refunding $1317 to my account. I even have an email from the seller confirming the refund and cancellation. Moreover , I have an email from a PayPal rep named John . He confirmed the seller had until May 25. At that point PayPal would refund . It’s May 28, and PayPal has now asked until June 4. Unacceptable. Their new supervisor Avinish has twisted the narrative to say I wanted to use a PayPal seller credit ( of which there is ZERO credit available) to make a $1317 purchase ? That’s preposterous and a lie . I wanted the purchase from my American Express with pay in 4 option . They CONVENIENTLY obviated that payment option because they knew Amex had buyers protection where debit cards rarely have this . As of May 28, I have sent Paypay the sellers email confirming the refund and cancellation. PayPal also has the RECORDING of their own rep John saying the dispute would be closed by May 25 and my money refunded .PayPal has engaged in predatory and bad business practices.
