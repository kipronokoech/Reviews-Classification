I then remembered that I actually paid via PayPal so asked if they could step in and help me. Of course they were happy to help but it was not straight forward unfortunately and the claim I raised with them was closed down more than once - apparently the seller was providing them with valid evidence the tickets had been delivered to the correct address but sadly I had this "evidence" too and knew it showed nothing at all!! It was so frustrating but I had the determination that I would make paypal see that I hadn\'t done anything wrong and I really did deserve my refund... after getting really upset on the phone for the final time and explaining my situation for about the 100th time, PayPal agreed to appeal my case and asked the seller for a different type of evidence (receipt of delivery) - horaay! I called up yesterday as hadn\'t heard from them in a good few days and much to my surprise it was good news for once!! The seller had not replied and therefore paypal were able to give me a full refund! I could not believe what I was hearing! I had lost all hope and honestly I can not thank PayPal enough for helping me - it hasn\'t been perfect as I explained and I had to keep pushing but it was a very complex situation and we got there in the end! :) - don\'t give up with PayPal, be patient and they will resolve your problem for sure, it really does just take time :).', 'review_date': '2017-09-23', 'review_time': '08:04:46', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

No any question, nothing, just close without possibility to open.\nBy several calls and email they promise to open case as soon the package arrives to his destination.
