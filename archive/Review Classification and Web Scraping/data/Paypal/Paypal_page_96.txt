Until several days ago, everything was great and I had not experienced any issues.\n\nRecently, however, I received a small, $2.00 donation through a photo-sharing site where I have chosen to make some of my photography available for download. Payment is not expected or required and donations are freely given if individuals who download my photos choose to do so.\n\nAs far as I can tell, this donation is what caused PayPal to limit my account and flag me as a "new merchant". I have tried calling and have been using the message centre in an attempt to resolve this issue, without success.\n\nPayPal is now requiring me to send them sensitive information and to answer irrelevant questions about my business (such as where I store my product/inventory). I do not sell physical goods; I am an ESL tutor who offers online English lessons.\n\nI no longer have access to my income through PayPal and I am also unable to pay certain expenses for other platforms and services I had connected to PayPal. Needless to say, this unwarranted and unjustified limitation of my account has caused me to lose all trust in PayPal.\n\nAttempts at resolving the issue have only resulted in generic cut-and-paste responses from PayPal support. They have not and do not seem willing to investigate why my account has unexpectedly been limited after 4 years. Neither will they give me more detailed information so that I can be sure that this will not happen again in the future.\n\nMy advice is to be very careful if you choose to use PayPal, especially for your income or business-related activities. Clearly, PayPal has the ability to arbitrarily freeze all access to funds, without explanation or justification.\n\nI have also been threatened with further restrictions should I fail to provide the sensitive, personal documentation they are inexplicably demanding.\n\nI will be taking my business and finances elsewhere, to a company I can trust.\n\nUser beware!', 'review_date': '2023-02-28', 'review_time': '17:08:53', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
