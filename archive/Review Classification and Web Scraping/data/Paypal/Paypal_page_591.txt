I wrote many emails to the company with the request to pay back my money. They did not.\nSo I asked PayPal (a European company according to my account infos) to reverse the money transaction, since there is no legal contract in force and therefor no obligation to give money to the Chinese scammers/fraudsters. They declined both requests WITHOUT checking the facts. So they prove to be part of the scammers scheme, since they will hold my money and PayPal will not give it back to me.

Paypal, on the other side, proved themselves during the Pandemic when holiday operators and airline companies refused to refund for cancellations - Paypal was there to defend the customer that didn't receive the service. For that, I am thankful to the Paypal team.\nPaypal Credit service is very convenient, and in general, I fond them better than Credit Cards when your interest-free period expires. Decent interest (compared to Mastercard), interest-free period and flexibility.\nFor eBay purchases, there is ”pay after delivery” option which makes me confident to buy online, especially when we know that there is a lot of scams on eBay.", 'review_date': '2020-05-29', 'review_time': '11:43:19', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

Paypal have declined to repay my money claiming the item is not "materially different from the item advertised". I assume they are using artifical intelligence to work that out! So today I tried to take it further. Customer Service online message sent me to a phone number which is currently disconnected due to the virus. Surely she knew that? Then I tried again and another operative came on and said she had read my message and would put me on to the Disputes Claims specialist and I should stay connected which was now 40 minutes ago. It\'s all just a way of stalling you and I am astonished that this level of service which is based on sheer lying to customers, is the company ethos? Customer Service does not mean fobbing customers who have legitimate grievances off. At least my trashy garment only cost £$45 - some people using Paypal seem to be losing far more. As for the original Facebook advert - the options to report a site do not include the one that says it is a fake site so that is a waste of time too.
