This just happened to me. I saw an advertisement on Facebook (yes, on this website) that a company AIKPRO sells a nice Foldable Picnic Table Set. I think it is nice to have one. So I ordered one at U$26.98 = A$ 41.48. After 3 weeks or so I received a cheap watche which is worth about $3 if I buy it in China. Firstly I was confused as I never ordered a watch, so I contacted the courier to give me more details of the sender. (I have email correspondence). In the meantime I also approach to seller by sending an email which was on their website, but the email address was wrong and the mail didn\'t delivered.\n\nI came to realize that this is a bait and switch scam. So I turned to Paypal and filed a complaint and i ask full refund.\n\nAfter 2 days the seller responded through Paypal that it can offer US$10 as a partial refund which i refused. I was continuously in contact with Paypal customer service and sorry to say was treated like a s***t statements like " May I refresh your memory" by Jocelyn.\nFinally i was told by Paypal that seller is ready to refund full but i have to send the cheap watch back which i never ordered and bear the shipment cost.\n\nWell, exactly like what this AIKPRO customer service were slow, Paypal told me that I need to return the product to the seller in order to ask for a full refund, according to its customer service policy. So I refused to return the product and asked for a full refund, pointing out to Paypal this is a typical bait and switch scam. Paypal simply ignored me.\nIt is amazing that Paypal keeps standing on the scammer side, ignoring the alerts, and continuing to encourage the scam. Now the scammer continue to scam with different company names. Paypal even deleted the scammer information from its community as a sign of sustainable support to the scammers. This is outrageous.

A little mark on the screen was found on the item, I told them about it and they told me they’re not sending anymore emails and I will not get any refund, they claimed I falsely accused them of making excuses when their responsibility is to ensure customer satisfaction and got annoyed for me leaving negative feedback, what did they expect when I paid €23 for shipping and then they tell me it’s not even insured weeks after yet they would give me a full refund when 3 months had been reached from the sale date and even if the item was received before those 3 months passed I would be getting a refund from shipping, then when it had reached 3 months they changed everything they agreed on to not refunding me at all, you can change your words but I have the proof. The email to me on the 23rd May 2020 included this:\n\nif the item hasn't been delivered in 3 months, it will be deemed lost\nIf this final outcome takes place, this is when we will issue a full refund and take full responsibility\nWe have already lost thousands of dollars due to items not being delivered within 3 months and we will issue you a refund as well in the case that the item is not delivered within that time frame.\n\nTheir email on the 26th June 2020:\n\nUnfortunately the courier company will not be issuing any refunds for items that arrive.\n\nThese sellers are just something else and the worst part is they are getting away with it because I contacted PayPal and opened a dispute early May, I closed the dispute days later as the sellers assured me the item should arrive 2 weeks later and I wasn’t getting any response (they also had to contact the sellers before it went to PayPal which is just awful as the sellers knew what they were doing. They didn’t reply to the PayPal case for days yet responded to me days later on eBay when I messaged them) they blackmailed me with telling me that they would keep on calling me everyday until I return the item if I got any refund. I contacted eBay 3 times. The first time was before I opened the case in which the agent said I should receive a full refund and apologised for the inconvenience. The second time was a week or so ago and the agent said even though I closed the dispute I can reopen it and it should be sorted out, the third time a few days ago I was told the same thing or to go to my bank.
