So i decided to phone them, when you call you get an automatic voice that badly guesses what you want and proceeds to tell you what it thinks you want. so after almost a week I am still trying to get help. is the UK regulator ignoring Paypal, any other bank wold be fined', 'review_date': '2020-03-08', 'review_time': '08:56:30', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
