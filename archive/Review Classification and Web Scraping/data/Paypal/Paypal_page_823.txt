I have had Paypal for several years and all seem to work well since I paid off immediately.

You then owe them the money which hits their credit (lending) process. Problem is that you always end up having late payement charges!! this is the catch and a customer credit trap. For ten years I never had any fine until this company decides to put me on this and which I could not cancel since there was always an amount to clear then closure was never actioned. Plus no trace of person accountable. I thought I would add a layer of security to my payments online but infact it adds further risk and financial penalties. If anyone is suing, please let me know and Ill be happy to hold them to account!! I'm sick of companies like this calling you after they read reviews like this and try to apologies.

I ordered an iPhone 8+ a few weeks ago from John Lewis to collect at Waitrose. My partner collected it on his way back from the gym and and took it home to me- I was really excited as I’d spent a lot of money (£779) on this phone and it was a big deal for me. I opened the cardboard box (which looked awfully taped together but I didn’t think anything of it) and low and behold the phone was not in the unsealed iPhone box inside. I was shocked and in complete disbelief but we immediately drove down to Waitrose to show them- I phoned John Lewis straight away and explained the situation, to which the woman was completely useless and gave me no re-assurance at all. I was told that they would get back to me in three days, in which they did not- in fact it actually took over a week of constant phone calls to the police, citizens rights and John Lewis to hear anything back. I told John Lewis that I had reported it to the police and had a crime reference but they seemed completely unbothered ( I’m only 20 years old and I genuinely felt like they weren’t treating me like an adult and taking me seriously which was disgusting) , to which I then opened up a dispute with PayPal. Paypal were on the case straight away- reassuring me that they would take the case from then on and if they didn’t hear back from John Lewis within the given time that immediate action would be taken. I was absolutely racked with anxiety after spending every moment of my spare time (evenings, lunch breaks at work) on the phone, writing up references, gathering as much information as I could and I was absolutely exhausted. I had a short holiday coming up with my partner which I wanted to enjoy but I struggled to because of the upset of the situation. However, my luck completely turned round at the end of the holiday. I was obsessively checking my emails as the given time was up for John Lewis to reply, and in the afternoon I got a message from PayPal saying that they took my favour and refunded the whole balance. I was absolutely over the moon and I felt and still feel so lucky to have bought through such a reliable company. I cannot thank PayPal customer services enough as they gave me the re- assurance which John Lewis never gave me. I really wish I got the names of the people who I spoke to because they were so helpful and could tell that I was very stressed so they did everything they could to talk me through the situation and make me feel less anxious. Thank you so much. I feel extremely lucky to have bought through PayPal and I will be using them for the rest of my life.', 'review_date': '2018-01-30', 'review_time': '22:09:00', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

So I don\'t get what I ordered when I paid with Paypal, and even though the company has stated in the comments of the case they owe me the money & there is no refund for the transaction on Paypal - Paypal still doesn\'t give me the refund with no explanation. When I speak with Paypal the Customer Service reps guarantee each time I will get the refund but say they aren\'t able to process the refund themselves but another department does that - then the department that is supposed to refund doesn\'t do it with no explanation.
