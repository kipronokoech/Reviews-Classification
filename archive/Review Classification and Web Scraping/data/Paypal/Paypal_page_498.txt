I payed through PayPal. When I started the dispute on June 5 2020 with PayPal to reach Colelila you went through an address with Colelila and chicyoins in it and then it changed to an address with PayPal and lureher in it. This was so confusing and "lureher" made me angry. It didn\'t seem to bother PayPal at all that Colelila used paypal in their address. So for 3 months PayPal gave me deadlines to give them more information on this case and I did with everything I got. They finally told me Colelila would give me a full refund of $79.99, but had to send the doll back to a given address with certain information that I followed to a T. I took pictures of everything I did and kept all of my conversations both with PayPal and Colelila. I shared all of this with PayPal and then on September 7 PayPal said they didn\'t have valid proof or tracking that I returned the doll. That was not true. I gave them everything I had including pictures. I am so disappointed in PayPal because after all 3 months of making me jump through hoops and meeting their deadlines I have nothing, not even the 50 cent doll that Colelila scammed me with. Now that I have been scammed by Colelila I have seen that this has happened to many people. Don\'t you think PayPal has been involved with many of those disbutes too? I think many people have gone through exactly what I\'ve gone through. I wonder how many of them have come out with better results? I have learned a very good lesson on ordering online and I\'m sorry to say that I will not be using PayPal anymore because I have to many questions about how honest they are.', 'review_date': '2020-09-28', 'review_time': '16:29:08', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

Took it too Post Net and with tracking would be 130.00 dont know why it is so expensive but thats what I was quoted, so its a no brainer that I would be in the hole trying to get $46.98 back and paying $130.00 to ship it. What a scam and you know they know that. So I contacted Paypal with a followup just typing to a chat person, no a real alive person, and have not heard a thing.
