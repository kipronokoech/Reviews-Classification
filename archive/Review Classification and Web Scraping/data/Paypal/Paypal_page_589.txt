I have used Paypal for several years without problem and would have recommended it to anyone. However there is an anomaly in their refund procedure. I bought 3 items from M&S online using Paypal which is connected to my credit card. They arrived separately, so I had 2 invoices. I returned 2 of the items to the store. Having separate invoices they were refunded separately and I received 2 receipts. Paypal accepted the first refund but rejected the second refund. I have gone through the resolution centre twice and they have rejected my claim twice because 'my claim doesn't match our qualification for a billing dispute'. I have now put the matter into the hands of Marks & Spencer who owe me the money and hope there won't be a problem there. I cannot contact Paypal by phone and they do not appear to take any notice of my complaint as everything is automated. Very frustrating and so wrong.\nUpdate: after several weeks going backwards and forwards it would seem that M&S were at fault afterall. One of their call centre agents in South Africa managed to override their system and send the refund to me through Paypal.\nBut beware I found out the hard way that if you take returns back to the store Paypal will not accept a refund receipt as evidence.
