They have always been a bit difficult to get help from, but recently they have totally turned off customer support in exchange for automated robots who cannot answer anything.\nWorse than this, they have an annoyingly broken 'Security Challenge' system setup on their account site's login page, that does not even function correctly. No matter how many times you solve the puzzles asked for, it always starts the challenge over, with a whole new screen of challenges. This leads to having to do the same challenge multiple times, and just pray that it will let you in.\nTrying to cal them is a waste of time, because, of course, a robot will answer, and tell you to use the 'Message Center' on the website, which you then have to spend an hour trying to log into. This 'Message Center' is like most automated support systems, in that it has a very limited range of questions that can be asked of it, with anything it does not understand, (Being everything) leading to you being instructed to try Facebook, or Twitter, for your concerns, neither of which will garner a response of any kind from these criminals.\nThey are safely hidden behind a wall of anonymity, when it comes to helping people with their money issues. This is strange because that is all they do!!\n\nPS. I would suggest filing a complaint with one of the reputable Government entities that is meant to handle these large companies gone amuck. Not BBB, because they are in LOVE with PayPal, and will do nothing, but add your complaint to a list of other complaints, without even contacting the company itself. Try the FTC, or better yet, the Consumer Finance Report site, both of which are '.gov' sites, that cannot legally be ignored by any company, no matter how big time they think they are!!", 'review_date': '2020-12-06', 'review_time': '20:54:00', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
