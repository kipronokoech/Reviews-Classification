All of a sudden June 10th I ordered a starter for my boat on eBay. It said if I order it now I would receive it between 14th and 15th. I received an email from PayPal on the 10th saying they paid it. My bank account says they paid PayPal. Ebay says PayPal never paid them. I tried reaching out to PayPal for accountability and it's like pulling teeth. It seems all ebay and Paypal are concerned with is giving me my money back. The problem I have is one or the other is/was trying to scam me. I want to know which it was so I can ban them. So far ebay says it was PayPal doing the scamming. PayPal will not defend their selves and help me who to stop doing business with. See if anyone with half a brain can figure this out. The 15th is Thursday, we have a big fishing trip on Saturday. I've already been scammed of 3 days of getting a starter for my boat. Now our trip is ruined. I want accountability, business is business. I was told if buy I would receive on this date. I paid. Someone is trying to scam me. So yes I want to know who ruined our trip because I would never do business with that shady business again. You have been warned. One of the two has a scammer working there and the business is covering it up. UPDATE: PayPal finally talked to me. They got proof eBay was paid. They also said the seller would be banned from ever using PayPal for his company again and eBay has been flag for the seller to never sell on ebay again. They say that company scammed and took my money.
