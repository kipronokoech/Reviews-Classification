I gave them the freaking shipping info confirming it was delivered even back prior to the transaction happening; not good enough! Escalated to 2 supervisors which the final one comes out and says their system needs 24 hours to recognize the shipping info uploaded and is delivered etc etc. Said they can\'t manually override until 24 hours after its uploaded and even then it will likely bug out because the delivery date is before the transaction date and apparently this is such an anomaly they have never seen before, they had no way of efficiently planning for this because apparently shipping only happens after any and ALL paypal transactions lol horrible service.', 'review_date': '2021-11-05', 'review_time': '23:27:58', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
