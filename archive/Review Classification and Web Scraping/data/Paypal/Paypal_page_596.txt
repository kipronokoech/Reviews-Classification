As soon as I noticed this I tried to contact paypal but there is no one available and there isn’t even an option on the paypal site to dispute it. Without any investigation, paypal immediately refunded the scammers which put my account into -£178. I was helpless and couldn’t contact anyone to speak to them about this. However, they were quick to contact me to say I now owed them money. I sent emails backwards and forwards for over a month. Every time I got a reply that had nothing to do with what I telling them or just a generic pretyped response. First they just said they couldn’t help, then someone said that i’d get a refund so I waited for the refund to be processed...which never happened so had to email them again and again explaining the whole situation from the start. Again got nothing but generic replies or replies that had nothing to do with the situation. Received a text message today from a debt collection agency who they have contacted to get the money back! Its absolutely stunned! They’ve basically decided to ignore me and get another company to force me to pay! They’d rather wash their hands of their customers.
