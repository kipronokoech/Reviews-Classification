I was in London, and didn't have enough in the bank to cover the return train fare. PayPal told me it would take no more than two hours (fine, I had three to spare). Two days later, still no money, no human reply to any emails, no customer support whatsoever. I had to borrow £80 from a service in London to pay the fare (for which I was charged about £20 interest). I've lost a huge amount of money, and they have neither apologised or offered any reimbursement. If (hopefully when) the money is transferred to my bank, I will be closing my account with PayPal and complaining to the relevant authorities.\n\nI ADVISE YOU TO STAY WELL AWAY.", 'review_date': '2014-11-18', 'review_time': '14:23:52', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
