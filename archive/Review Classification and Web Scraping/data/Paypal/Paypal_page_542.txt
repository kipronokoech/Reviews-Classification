The whole point of PayPal is to protect the buyer, but instead, they have condescending advisors reading from a sheet of paper & couldn’t care less.\nAfter being scammed by Jomashop who sent me a worthless item and not the item I purchased, I thought it was a no-brainer for PayPal to step in and recover the funds..... instead, they favoured the criminals and closed the case (Even with hard evidence.) After I complained, they said I’d have to get in touch with my bank to resolve!!! I said that I might as well pay on my card & let the bank sort out recovering the funds; which they will do. I realised PayPal are either working with these criminal online businesses or turning a blind eye for profit. I closed my PayPal account soon after and good riddance.', 'review_date': '2020-07-30', 'review_time': '22:31:47', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
