I called customer service and it was TERRIBLE. They outsource to India to a group who knows even less than I do.\nOn the first call, the man read me off a list of questions about my past vehicles. I don\'t remember things like what color my car from 20 years ago was, plus the guy didn\'t pronounce a lot of things right so was hard to understand. The couple of questions I know I answered correctly wasn\'t enough, so I was passed along to Lisa, who kept calling me Christine and suggested I just try again later. Next I talked to John, who advised I would have to wait another 48 hours to try again.\nSo two days later I call again and reach Jenny, who I really thought was going to help...but when she couldn\'t update my phone number herself said that she couldn\'t give me a time frame but that I would just have to try and enter the number again. I updated the number on Monday. It\'s now Friday. Five days wasn\'t enough...but maybe six will do it? Jenny (who also called me Christine after I corrected her) just wanted to get me off the phone and again, didn\'t know any more than I did.\nPaypal is supposed to be a legitimate company. "I can\'t fix it and don\'t know when or how you can" shouldn\'t be acceptable. They are trained to give the excuse that it\'s for your security, but this was a problem changing a *phone number* and there was no suggestions given how to prove the number was mine (even though the fact that I was calling from the number should have been good enough). The problem was a glitch in their website, not a security issue, but no one will admit that.\nSo if you use Paypal, NEVER get a new phone number. You aren\'t allowed.

You are fine if everything works perfectly but heaven help you if something goes wrong because PP won\'t.\n----------\nIn the interest of fairness, I must report that this entire kerfuffle was triggered by miscommunication. The recipient DID receive the gift but the spouse had withdrawn the funds without informing the partner.\n\nBUT, I stand behind my criticism of PP support. Accessing PP support is a nightmare and the whole drama could have been avoided if PP support, once accessed, had confirmed that the COMPLETE transaction was successful instead of just one half of the transaction. Instead they tossed the ball between the sender and receiver and said "sort it out yourselves because PP doesn\'t know what happened".\n----------\nI sent a PayPal gift from Germany to a recipient in the US. All fine on the sending end, the recipient received an email notification of the gift but the funds never appeared in the account. German PP support, even given the transaction ID, could only access info about me (the sender) and could provide no insight at all into why the funds had not been received.\n\nI tried to use the so-called support site to create a case for investigation. But the only option was to report suspicious activity and even that didn\'t work, with the site page sitting and spinning at the second step.\n\nThen I tried to contact US PP support by phone. After spending almost 5 minutes getting through the tortuous menu system I was simply told by recording that "We can\'t support your inquiry over the phone." and disconnected.\n\nThe funds left my account on the date of the transaction and, twenty days later, I am no closer to finding out what happened to the funds.\n\nNow they are just adding insult to injury. I submitted my initial inquiry via the messaging system a second time and got the identical canned response explaining how to send money.\n\nThen they finally responded to my complaint about the poor customer service experience trying to find out what happened to the funds with this (copied and pasted so any errors belong to PP):\n"Thank you for your inquiry to PayPal.\nIt is very important to us to provide you with the best customer service possible.
