I purchased through PayPal October and received my item about four weeks later from China. The item sent was not the item ordered. I immediately reported it to PayPal knowing it was complete deception from the company. I was given information from PayPal on how to return item. I took pictures of package tracking numbers as instructed by PayPal. PayPal had me jump through so many hoops and pay for return postage. I sent the tracking numbers to PayPal. Initially PayPal denied the claim claiming tracking numbers didn’t track. When I received an email from the company that I purchased the item from verifying receiving item and only offered half of my money back, I sent that to PayPal. PayPal then changed the denial reason to no proof item was not as described.
