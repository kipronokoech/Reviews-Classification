According to my bank, the delay happens because “a faster speed was not available for that particular transaction at that particular time.” I did not cause the delay and I cannot speed it up. I used Zelle as a quick way to send money to a friend, and now he must wait 3 days which is an unexpected problem. And since the money has left my account, it’s no longer available to me - so there is $200 in limbo between us that neither of us can use for 3 days. Now - if Zelle was a 3-day money transfer service, of course this would be no problem. But, it is not usually a 3-day service, and that’s why I like it. The unpredictable, arbitrary delay however means that I must assume all transactions sent through Zelle might take 3 days.

There are no guidelines given to you before you attempt. Then you find out it can only be for $1000. No attempt to notify you of how much or what the waiting period is for you to make another payment when one has to pay 3100. You try the next day: your pia landlord only wants to elicit payments so you don\'t have the info to send on your own. You call the landlord to tell him "elicit the payment and I\'ll pay" You go back to zelle and everything goes until you try to hit the "send" button, it does not work. You call support. (be careful, if you look online for the support number, it\'s a scam) You finally find the internal number for support. They deftly lead you through the process after 25 minutes of talk and proof of who you are. You push "send" it does not work. You open up a computer to try there: same thing. Your landlord likely thinks you are just an idiot because no one else has a problem. You had support lead you. You did it right. You inadvertantly gave phony support a credit card number before finding the legit support. You had to cancel your credit card that you use for amazon and other payments and get another number. Your life has become impossible. These services need work. I should have gotten an explanation of why it would not send when I clicked send. I clicked on the background to make sure the arrow was in the right environment. I tried all of the things that you do when buttons don\'t work. Zelle basically does not take care of customers. This is not a service to trust with your money. It is not always user friendly. If you miss the little message button with a little red dot on it, you do not know this is the message from your landlord that elicits a payment. Not user friendly enough. The few pop ups that one gets do not explain enough of why things don\'t work and what the parameters...time between payments if one had to divide it into separate payments, amounts, etc for people to troubleshoot possibly giving their financial life and all of their time away.

These are very elaborate business scams that have masking technology that goes so far as to have the company logo identified in the call. By the time you can get home to check out the legitimacy it is too late! Your money is gone forever as you do not have a sympathetic ear to hear you out. Your Bank will catagorically deny reimbursement although recently I have read that due to the media reporting the abundance of these scams the financial institutions are starting to cave because they do not want the bad publicity. The real problem is the Zelle Platform was the invention of these big conglomerates like BofA, WellsFargo,and JPMorganChase to name a few so they stand to lose a lot by having to go back to the drawing board to come up with a safe mode of online payments. I dislike Zelle intensely and moved most of my funds to another Banking Institution which doesn\'t seem to bother Chase which I did all my business with for over 30 years, they just don\'t care. Zelle is not a safe platform and this has attracted a new breed of scammers to rob you of your money!

I got an agent listen to my issue.\n\nAfter hearing my story. It is pure silence, I have asked several times “Are you there?” — Pure Silence, after 10 minutes. I hang up and redialed the support line\n\nAfter another 3 minutes of recorded message again and a few minutes wait, another agent answered, I asked to transfer to a supervisor, after some more wait. I got a supervisor Gelie\n\nGelie heard my story and offered to debug with me together, she asked me to login to the app first. At this time, I can not login anymore and got error code C301\n\nAsking Gelie what does C301 mean, she said she can not speak on this matter but escalate to the second level and give me the case number 12224594 and give me another phone number 844-824-6613 in case got disconnected\n\nI was escalated to second level support, Camille answered, after repeat my story again, I ask her what does C301 mean. She answered it means “your profile is deactivated”. I was telling her that the agent can just silently deactivate my profile without any explanation is a big SECURITY HOLE\n\nNext, Camille denies everything.\n\n1. Why my account is deactivated? Her new explanation is my account has been logged in too many times and their system has security built in to do that, I told her I logged in about 3 times today without any incorrect password, what kind of system will do that? She just repeat this is system behavior\n\n2. As for the transaction, I give the date and amount. She just claim there is no record in their system and I need to contact the bank\n\nI have several questions for Zelle here and all the readers can judge\n\n1. If you did not do anything wrong, if your system incorrectly deactivated my account, why none of your agent reactivate it?\n\n2.Is that a good coincident that immediately after the first agent hear my story and silent for 10 minutes then my account get deactivated by system? Convince yourself before you make up this story\n\n3. You can deny your system does not have transaction history, however the sender side has history and screen shot. You deactivate my account so that I can not see transaction history can not erase the sender side history\n\n4.The way you deactivate my account after I state the problem only PROVE you try to prevent me from output the transaction history and prove your company STEAL MONEY from customer\n\n5. Gelie, the first supervisor response after heard the error code C301 -- she can not say anything but escalate to the second level and your second level just claim your system does not have any record of transaction already indicate the problem\n\n6.

Not everyone has a bank that Zelle works with. Both of these things are relevant to my experience.\nUntil today, I used Zelle only once...that was because I needed some financial help from a friend who happens to be a Bank of America customer. Unlike most banks, they only allow bank to bank transfers through third party Zelle. My credit union, SSFCU is not Zelle-connected so I jumped through some very difficult hoops in order to make this transfer happen. I have not needed it since 2019. Fast forward until today. Same friend, Bank of America, Zelle, and my SSFCU account. She attempted to make a transfer to me but it never went through on my end. The reason? When they SHOULD tie account numbers to users, knowing that debit cards do expire, the transfer stalled and I was locked out of Zelle since the CVV on the back of my card had changed and I had been issued a new card. No one asked me for an update. When the agent was walking me through re-enrolling, we found that because I do not have text messaging, she had to inform me I was out of luck and there was no way the verification code could be emailed to me. In 2021? Only one mode of verification??? There was no way around this. End of story: I am out $3904 which she said would go back into my friend's Bank of America account. It hasn't appeared yet so maybe it will be lost in cyberspace. Now, if I can't even afford text messaging/data do you think I can afford losing all of that money?

The funds still did not show up. I called Zelle and they updated something. The money still did not show up. I called my bank and they said they cannot see the funds and there isn\'t much else they can do if the funds are showing up to be deposited. I called Zelle back and they said I needed to contact the sender of the money and have them call their bank to see what happened or to let the transfer expire (you only have 14 days to claim your funds) and have the sender try again. Zelle stated they have no way to investigate where the money is, it is completely up to the sending and receiving financial institutions to help you figure out where your money is on their platform. So if you are using Zelle to receive money from someone that you don\'t know well (i.e. making a purchase, selling on offer up, etc) there is a good chance that the person sending their money could get it back and there will be on recourse on your end.

I rarely am in the US so I don't have a US phone number. I regularly pay contractors for services and have been forced to use other means to pay them, which renders my online banking useless. I understand the security issues behind forcing people to have a US number, but in this modern world there must be other ways to verify identity. Furthermore, 2020 has pushed a lot of people into remote work so international banking is becoming more and more relevant. Besides that, many people in the US cannot afford a phone, especially with the catastrophe that is COVID-related unemployment.\n\nI messaged their customer service about this and asked if they could make an effort to find other verification means as their service is already obsolete and is forcing me to switch banks. I was told to talk to my bank, though my bank said that it was Zelle's security requirements that were preventing me from transferring money anywhere.\n\nSo the app is useless and so is their customer support team.\n\nBasically, my own god damned money is being held hostage by this app. I would not use it if I had the choice but Wells Fargo has made the choice for me.

I thought maybe I did something wrong, so I tried again. Same error with no explanation. I logged in this morning to try again, same error so I called customer service. They couldn\'t really tell me what the error code was but told me I needed to call my bank. They also told me my profile was ineligible (?) and is going to be shut down. I called my bank and they told me they saw a transaction try to come through last night and it was rejected because of mismatched expiration date. I call zelle back with my information and they tell me my profile has already been shut down. I told them this was BS. I used them once it was fine, used them twice and they boot me off their app!! Yet they still have my debit card info. They wouldn\'t delete my profile. They just told me it was inactive. Oh best of all is that they told me that if I get a new phone and phone number, then I could download the app and use it again.
