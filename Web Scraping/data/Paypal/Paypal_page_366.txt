The item arrived and no sooner had we fitted the legs, we found that the item was so poorly constructed that it gave way before we had even had time to use it.\nWe contacted the seller and they offered us the fantastic option of a £40.00 refund. Feeling insulted by this; we contacted Pay Pal under the false impression that they would look into the matter offer a resolution.\nWhat a resolution they offered us:\nThe item had to be returned to the sellers address by recorded delivery. The item was delivered from a location at:\nCommercial Park Unit 1, Dorsey Way, Enderby, Leicester, LE19 4DB, United Kingdom, GB.\nHowever according to Pay Pal; the address we had to return the item to is:\nETERNITY INTERNATIONAL TRADING LIMITED\n2/F, NO.8 NO 3601 DONGFANG ROAD, PUDONG NEW AERA, SHANGHAI, CHINA 200125 Kowloon City, Kowloon HK.\nThe cost of us returning this item was quoted at £326.08 :-0\nYes that\'s right: £326.08\nFor an item that cost us £99.99\nPay Pal weren\'t totally useless though, they did offer to refund us a whopping £15.00 towards our costs.\nWhen we informed Pay Pal that we were unwilling to pay such an exuberant amount for a product that was damaged upon receipt, they basically informed us that if we did not provide tracking details within the nest six days; that they would judge in favour of the seller.\nWe are now stuck with an item that is unusable for its intended use as it cannot take the weight of any person; either sitting or lying-down.\nNo doubt that Pay Pal will continue to trade and claim themselves to be of an honorable nature, but I know that this is not the case. I now know that there are alternatives to Pay Pal out there and I most certainly will be looking for a way whereby I will never have to trust or use this despicably dishonorable company again in the future.\nIf you are reading this rating then\n"PLEASE RECONSIDER USING PAY PAY FOR ANY PAYMENTS"', 'review_date': '2021-03-22', 'review_time': '12:02:16', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

Never a problem or dispute. The most I got from a rep was suspicious activity. Again, 16 years of ebay shopping. I didn't change but they sure did. I asked for a supervisor and he was pure attitude and told me I would have to sue for an explanation.\n\nI recently made one more try. The rep even said my history was spotless and saw no reason for me being frozen. She requested a review for reinstatement. After waiting foe days, I called in. They didn't even have the courtesy to email a reply saying no. They basically babbled something about security risk. I'm sorry, but I make a purchase on Ebay, get sent to Paypal to approve, then they debit it from my account. They and Ebay handle the security, so that excuse is total bull s***. They make the rules and we have to work within them. Don't tell me I'm a security risk when I don't program the servers. That's a total garbage cop out excuse.\n\nPrior to this is how they burned a friend. After the recession she no longer had a bank account. Every penny she had in this world was in her paypal acct. Without warning they froze her. They refused to give her any explanation and said she would have to wait a minimum of 6 months to be reimbursed. She never got her money back.\n\nIt is my personal opinion that these people are complete crooks. I strongly advise that you never let them hold your funds so they can't confiscate your money. Move it out of their system as soon as it hits. They won't even let you remove your banking info so you have to call your bank to block them so they can't take any more from you.\n\nJust watch them on facebook, both paypal and paypal xoom. I and others have called them out. They remove the negative comments and block anyone who posts them. What does that tell you? They hide from and block all negative feedback so people will not be warned. They are afraid of the truth getting out. Total censorship of feedback that the public has a right to see.\n\nDo yourself a huge favor and stay clear.
