Here's why:\n\nPoor Customer Support: Dealing with PayPal's customer support was an absolute nightmare. Whenever I encountered an issue or had a question, it seemed nearly impossible to get a timely response or any meaningful assistance. Their representatives seemed disinterested and provided generic, unhelpful responses.\n\nFrequent Account Freezes: PayPal has a reputation for freezing accounts without warning or explanation, and I unfortunately fell victim to this. It was incredibly frustrating to have my funds inaccessible for days on end, causing unnecessary stress and inconvenience. The lack of transparency regarding their account suspension policies is deeply concerning.\n\nExcessive Fees: PayPal's fees are exorbitant, especially when it comes to receiving payments from overseas or converting currencies. They seem to take advantage of their dominant position in the market by imposing unfair charges, significantly impacting the amount of money received.\n\nInconsistent Security Measures: While PayPal claims to prioritize security, I found their security measures to be inconsistent and unreliable. On several occasions, I received notifications of suspicious activity or potential fraud, only to find out that they had allowed unauthorized transactions to go through without any prompt action or preventive measures.\n\nLimited Seller Protection: As a seller, I expected PayPal to offer robust protection against fraudulent buyers. However, I was sorely disappointed when a buyer filed a false claim, and PayPal sided with them without thoroughly investigating the matter. This lack of support for sellers undermines trust and creates an unfavorable environment for conducting business.\n\nIn conclusion, my experience with PayPal has been nothing short of frustrating and disappointing. Their subpar customer support, arbitrary account freezes, excessive fees, inconsistent security measures, and limited seller protection have left me with a negative impression. I would strongly advise exploring alternative payment platforms that prioritize transparency, fair fees, and reliable customer service.", 'review_date': '2023-06-11', 'review_time': '15:02:15', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

I then made a large order of blinds over £500 which again arrived fine but the colour was wrong the blind's company advised they would change for the cost of £73.70 which I paid for again through Paypal and with it previously arriving fine the first time and with Paypal stating only my new address was on my account and with me only seeing this on my account I did not expect the second transaction to default to my old address, I now live 300 miles away and the blinds were 239cm long 6x in total there was no way I could fit these in a normal car so had to result to getting a courier service £280 to get them to my house.
