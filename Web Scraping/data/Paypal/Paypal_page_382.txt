"CLEVER"\n\n2 - Standard which is "free" and it takes up to 3 business days. (Guess what? It is not free! its has cost me two days on the phone hoping to find a nice professional agent to help me solve the nightmare I\'m going through. PayPal will punished you for not sharing a fee with them so you will regret it.\n\nI didn\'t want to share a penny with them, first because of their deficient customer service, it took me more than one full day of going through their automated system to speak to an agent, second because why would I? I paid eBay $100 dollars in fees for the sale and they want more ?? Why would eBay let PayPal decide for our money ???\n\nThe nightmare started when I chose the "STANDARD" free option, PayPal froze my funds, they said they wanted more information from me, they were asking for photo ID, purchase receipt of the item I sold, and more ..... What the heck ???\n\n* Was this all about the 1% fee I didn\'t want to share ?\n\n* Why PayPal allowed eBay to collect their sale fee if they wanted to confirm who I was ? Why not to freeze the funds for both ?\n\n* Why not to deny eBay to collect the money until full verification ?\n\n* I wonder what would\'ve been different if I had paid the fee PayPal wanted ?\n\nWHAT DID I DO WRONG ? I offered a great item at a great price, with an exceptional fast shipping service, the item was dropped off to UPS one hour after the item was paid for.\n\nI called eBay to ask for help and they simply told me " GOOD LUCK". I wanted to cancel the sale, I told them I wanted my item back and refund the buyer\'s money and they also refused to do that, they need each other to keep ripping off people like us.\n\nWHO IS GOING TO STOP THEM ??', 'review_date': '2021-02-25', 'review_time': '19:28:28', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
