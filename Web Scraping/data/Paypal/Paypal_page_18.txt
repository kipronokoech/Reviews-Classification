The item was not as described and I requested a refund. I provided the following information; a copy of the receipt, a picture of the item in comparison to another item to show it was not as described, and the information for the real item that the seller copied/imitated. This was not good enough and PayPal denied my request for a refund three times because they could not find the original listing for the item as the seller pulled it down when I filed the dispute. On top of this, the last person I spoke with from PayPal customer support was extremely rude and unhelpful. Apparently on top of the information I already provided I needed the listing of the item too. This is a MASSIVE flaw in Paypal's system that this seller was aware of and took advantage of.

This is an organization run by volunteers. No one takes a salary or receives any financial compensation. All of our volunteers are local professionals working together to make our community better.\n\nFur Babies Rescue had used PayPal to accept donations and also use it for a fundraising tool. We found out the hard way that PayPal can freeze an account and hold the money for 180 days. The account was frozen and now PayPal has control of $1,693.22 of the rescue’s funds. Those funds were going to help spay/neuter and vaccinate approximately 20 animals in need. We had to cancel the trip to the spay clinic that was scheduled for September 20, 2023.\n\nWe should have done our homework before signing up to use PayPal. If you Google “PayPal froze my account” you will find many horror stories and lawsuits because PayPal froze accounts.\n\nThere isn’t an easy way to dispute the account freeze or get help from PayPal. If we were a larger group with national support we could possibly fight it but we are just a small group of volunteers. We will have to work harder to raise more money and hope we get that money back from PayPal at the end of the 180 days.\n\nThis is not the way to treat a small 501(c)(3) nonprofit.
