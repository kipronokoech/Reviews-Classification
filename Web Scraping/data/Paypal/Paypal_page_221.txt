I had uploaded the return shipping tracking and a photo of return shipping label almost 4 weeks before. This was for a fraud product from a fraud company. Falsely advertised product which is illegal. Falsely advertised business, also illegal. Does a human read these disputes or any of the information?? I thought PayPal was the safe option for protection in online purchases, so wrong!!! I was also informed by PayPal that I would be refunded return shipping, so it was fine to return (as I was also disputing that I had to pay return shipping to Thailand for a fake product that I ordered from an Australian business with an Australian business web address and admin address) which cost me $66. I was refunded $45. It was never mentioned in these messages with PayPal that there was a maximum return shipping refund amount. So I end up out of pocket. I was refusing to return until the business sent me a return paid shipping label because they had a "BUYER PROTECTION" policy that specifically covered a product not being as described. It was all fake, and the actions of PayPal and their lack of ability to have a person actually read and understand all the dispute information has ended up in the business being supported and getting off scott free, while the legit customer is screwed over.', 'review_date': '2022-03-13', 'review_time': '03:21:57', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

On the first occasion I returned an item to a company in Singapore who disputed it had been received, PayPal refused the chargeback claim as they said the item had not been returned (despite evidence to the contrary) - I was able to charge back through my bank.\n\nThe second time I bought a product from a Facebook advertiser who turned out to be scammers, they provided fake tracking details three times and PayPal accepted that as proof of delivery despite Royal Mail's tracking clearly showing the alleged item would have been delivered over an hour away from the correct location. That time, because I had paid using bank transfer, I was unable to chargeback through my bank and PayPal allowed the fraudsters to keep their funds.\n\nSo - you can set up a fake website, use fake tracking details (which you can obtain directly from China Post's website), change your email address every time you contact someone and take your website down within a month or so of it being live... and PayPal will let you keep whatever money you make. They won't investigate you, they won't charge anything back from you, and they won't allow any disputes to remain open so long as you vaguely indicate someone might have delivered something somewhere close to the place you claim to deliver to, within a timeframe roughly in line with their order.\n\nI've since asked to close my account, but because the fools at PayPal offered me an account credit - after I explicitly refused it - I can't close it yet.

It is never as easy as just receiving funds from a friend or sender/buyer. The customer care representatives are very well mannered and kind. I've noticed that they will always help a client as far as their abilities allow them to. However, I still find it frustrating that the issues never corresponding to what has bee. Suggested by the customer care. As of now, I have tried absolutely everything to ensure my validation. I've sent in documents many times over. I find myself frustrated with the fact that I simply can not get my funds because of account limitations and account verifications and buyer/seller verifications ect. And the availability of PayPal customer care is difficult. Because of the fact that they operate within certain hours. I've missed bills and payments to debtors and I'm to answer to them everyday. I wish for paypal to have better communication and to make the platform more user friendly through informative information so that future transactions can be dealt with more efficiently.
