After 2 more rounds of questions , documents requests and our answers and submissions, PayPal permanently limited our account and locked the money for 180 days giving no other details than "your account has been suspended". They didn\'t tell us what was wrong there or how to fix the issues. However, after researching, we found that they can do whatever they want with your paypal money as long as you agreed with their T&C. This is a very aggressive and unfair deal. How many small businesses fall into their trap every year? $10,000 locked multiplied by 1000 accounts every 6 months?â€¦ this is how PayPal makes money during COVID knowing that for those small companies the easies / quickest way to get a merchant account up and running is PayPal?

{'platform': 'Paypal', 'id': '61426b35215cfcced2671d7e', 'stars': 2, 'title': 'Den of Theives', 'message': 'I have been using PayPal since 2008. The only good thing about PayPal is IF and only IF you are able to make a seamless transaction. In the event that you have to dispute a transaction or have a simple problem that needs to be resolved, PayPal fails miserably. Ever since they outsourced all operations overseas the service has become simply the worst payment option currently available. I recently had to make a dispute for a $200 product that I purchased but the company sent me the wrong product. I contacted the company and could get NO, ZERO response from my phone calls or emails or chat feature on the vendor\'s website. So, I was forced to call PayPal and file a dispute. All I can say is - using PayPal is just not worth your time. I filed my dispute, after waiting on hold for 30 minutes. Then I got someone on the phone and all she would say was "we appreciate your patience. We love you and your business. We are very sorry this happened to you" After repeating my issue at least 3 times she not only got it wrong each time, "wrong item arrived." She then said "I have to switch you to another dept." Another ten or more minutes on hold a representative picks up that had NO IDEA who I was or my name, issue etc. Not only do they ask my name, they want to know my address etc. I am fine giving it but they already asked upon initial contact. In 2021, shouldn\'t all my account information be on the computer when they transfer my call. I start all over again, explaining my reason for this simple, straightforward dispute. An hour later, no joke, they put you on hold then come back and ask the same questions over and over. Again, call centers overseas simply do not know our customs, laws, or anything about a simple process. She was telling me "well, you got your product." No, I told her - they sent me the wrong product that I paid for and I have tried several times to contact the seller. Finally, they then tell me they will handle my dispute. I finally get to hang up but then I get an email, days later asking me to respond to their questions. They tell you to go to the resolution center and when I did not only was there NO WAY to respond, the text in my dispute complaint was not at all accurate - after repeating to the representative at least 4 times initially. So, you have to call again and the same exact process as I detailed above happens. Wait on hold. Wait for someone to answer. Get transferred. Name. Address - all over again. Then, they have no idea about my dispute so you basically have to request a dispute again. They barrage you with the same thing "I appreciate your patience. We are extremely sorry that this happened to you etc." It is as if they are trying to wear you down so you just give up and just forget about any credit and go away; which is very easy to do as they are really inept and do not care. If you search PayPal you see 20K-and counting reviews that average 1 Star. But, if you look at their stock price, the stock is thriving. Why? Because of this very process I, and countless others have had to endure and endure today. PayPal is literally stealing from their customers. They told me that they would credit my account - never happened. So, you either call again or you just give up because the time it takes to call them again is simply not economical. In addition, when I told her that the wrong product was mailed, I told her that it was a mistake on the company\'s part. She was speaking to me in a tone and manner as if I was a thief or bad person and was making a dishonest claim. Her attitude was she was doing me a favor. Now, when I say "she" it is all of them. Since COVID I have noticed many companies are making mistakes, sending wrong products, products never arrive, and you cannot reach these customers other than to make a purchase. So, when you call PayPal, which I have had to do at least three times in the past 19 months, same runaround. I rarely use my PayPal now only if the transaction is under $10 so in the event I have an issue, I am only out a small amount of money.', 'review_date': '2021-09-15', 'review_time': '21:52:53', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
