And then they paid $390 of their own money knowing that it was a scam because, They had been told, for 4 weeks before they released the money, to the scammer. It's better to get yourself a credit card to pay for your purchases online. That way you don't get scammed or ripped off. Like you would if you were dealing with PayPal. And this was after, PayPal allowed them to scam me out of $1,000, and see nothing wrong with it, because they allow scammers to scam you. Because that's their policy.

I could not get in touch with Wowcher, no surprise there, as we live in a world where there is less and less contact with humans. I then got in touch with Paypal and they were hopeless, could do nothing to help me. So that is my relationship done with them. I cannot see the benefit of their service. Thankfully I paid by credit card and called them who sorted it out immediately. Now today Wowcher after my review on Trustpilot about my experience with them have refunded me my monies in full. What a shambles we all are responsible for buying on line and closing all our lovely high street shops. Many in small towns are family owned businesses and there is where you get the very best customer service. We should not forget this. We are creating a world where humans are being pushed out in favour of greed and faceless businesses that make it impossible to make contact with them.
