My last and final use of PayPal was recently when the seller supposedly sent me a package from China and it miraculously was placed on my doorstep the same day. PayPal didnt find that fishy and continued to say the seller had proof of my package being delivered. Seems to me like they have a stake in these fraudulant companies.
