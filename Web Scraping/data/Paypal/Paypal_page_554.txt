We used Pay Pal to pay for the order. It took 1 day for money to hit my bank account but we never received any info on when the items would be delivered. After 4 tries to get info, we opened a dispute through Pay Pal\'s resolution center. What a Joke! We finally were shipped 1 of the 4 items we ordered and Pay Pal promptly denied our claim. After contacting Pay Pal and telling them they prematurely closed my claim, they reopened it and changed the reason. After two months of providing all documentation I had, Pay Pal denied my dispute again for lack of documentation. The 1 item I received from Shieldstars came with no "packing slip" so I had no way of proving I hadn\'t received the other 3 items. Pay Pal must be "in bed" with Shieldstars. Bottom Line: Don\'t ever order anything from Shieldstars and secondly if you think you may get any help from Pay Pal resolving this type claim, THINK AGAIN! It\'s pretty apparent Pay Pal had no intentions of helping us get our money back from the start. They need to drop the "Pal" from their name and call themselve\'s "Pay".', 'review_date': '2020-07-16', 'review_time': '17:17:46', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
