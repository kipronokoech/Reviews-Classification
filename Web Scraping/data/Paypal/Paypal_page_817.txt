Used my account to pay for several hundred pounds worth of goods from my bank account with no issues. When i started selling 2nd hand items of mine on ebay paypal decided they wanted to put my account into review asking for proof of purchase of the items ive sold (cause everyone has invoices for there old items). Initailly told 24 hours for review then 72 hours and now 7 days as they are busy. I feel even after 7 days i will be told it wilp take longer despite paypal being provided with a copy of my passport, driving licence with current address, letter from hmrc in my current address and a linked bank account that has been used to pay for items previously. Further more the items sold have all been allocated tracking numbers upon sale and items have been recieved, signed for and feedback left yet paypal still arnt satisfied.

This morning I got an email from the merchant saying I had cancelled the payment and asking what I wanted to do. I had never cancelled the payment.\n\nI checked PayPal and they showed that I had made the payment and that the merchant had refunded it. I waded through all the PayPal crap to be able to call them, and they assured me that it was a refund and that only the merchant could have initiated the refund.\n\nI contacted the merchant, who knew he didn\'t refund the payment, so he called PayPal. First they told him I cancelled the payment. When he wouldn\'t accept that story, they checked some more and decided that it must have been a mistake by eBay\'s computers because I must have had several transactions being processed simultaneously (wrong because that was my only transaction last night). PayPal had credited the merchant then THREE SECONDS LATER PayPal took the money back.\n\nThe merchant contacted me again. Now, I still want my item, and the merchant still wants the money -- but PayPal still has my money. Their webpage says the money was refunded but my bank says it has not been refunded yet.\n\nChecking back and forth with PayPal and the bank, I find that PayPal says they already refunded the money BUT that it "may take up to 30 days to show up on your statement" which might be true for the monthly statement, but is NOT even slightly true for the bank\'s online system where transactions are posted in very near real time - transactions are posted in minutes, not days. All my transactions from this afternoon are already posted but still no refund - I called the bank and they say there are no outstanding transactions that have not been posted - certainly no transaction from last night.\n\nBottom line: PayPal still has my money. PayPal got my money; PayPal gave my money to the merchant then almost immediately took it back; I have nothing, the merchant has nothing, PayPal is sitting on my money drawing interest until they get around to actually processing the refund. Comments from other PayPal customers indicate that refunds really take anywhere from four days to a week before PayPal actually sends them.\n\nPayPal stalling on the refund is bad enough, but I wouldn\'t be nearly as upset if they were just honest enough to say "It\'s going to take us a week to get around to giving you back your money" but instead PayPal insists on lying both to me and to the merchant. They lied about what happened, they lied about the money being refunded, and of course, none of this is supposed to be their fault.', 'review_date': '2018-03-17', 'review_time': '23:03:39', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
