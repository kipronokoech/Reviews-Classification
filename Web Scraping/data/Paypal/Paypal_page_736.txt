I have read, reread, and reread the terms of service and acceptable users agreement and I cannot find anything that could warrant the action they took.

They're keeping all of my personal information: My name and address, social security number, bank account number, and my credit card numbers to ensure that I don't create another account. I asked if there was any way to remove my information and they again told me that I would have to seek legal action. I told them that I do not consent to them keeping my personal information, to which they told me I did when I signed up for PayPal. The funny thing is, they don't state anywhere in any of their policies that they will keep all personal information in this kind of event. I am okay without PayPal, I don't need it. If I did do something wrong I will accept the consequences, but if they're not willing to talk about it to resolve the issue, what's the point of having customer service?", 'review_date': '2019-07-02', 'review_time': '20:58:14', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
