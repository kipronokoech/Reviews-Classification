So here I am with no laptop but yet having to wait 3-5 days for it to be refunded which took 2 seconds to come out of my account. On top of that the laptop has now gone out of stock and my current laptop is working and I rely on a laptop as I work from home. I honestly did not realise how rubbish this company is.

Or as normal do they just not care?\nAnyway, I went through the crap to open a case, but was only allowed one small box, which I thought was telling Paypal what the problem was.\nIt turned out that the bit I wrote was actually going to the seller, not Paypal!\nWhat's the point of that?
