Someone made 2 purchases one totaling $226 & another one totaling $86. The shipping address on the purchases was for somewhere in Miami...I live in statesboro Georgia. I called my bank to make sure that none of the charges went through & to make sure they stop all charges coming from paypal. I then called PayPal while on the phone with my bank & they filed a claim for both of these charges. I got a refund for the $226 one but the other purchase they said they felt it was an authorized purchase. I then proceeded to call PayPal AGAIN when I saw my account was in the negatives. They said they weren't supposed to give me a refund for the $226 because they felt it was an authorized purchase and they weren't going to give me a refund for the $86. I had to call the company in which they made the purchase from & they were more than happy to give me a refund back, hassle free. When I googled the address where the packages were sent to it was an abandoned building. Long story short they didn't want to give me a refund for the fraudulent charges and was basically saying I was the one that made the purchases.

They hold your money until they feel like it.\n\nI joined paypal as a seller/buyer. Their policy says that I am protected as a seller if I ship to the confirmed address. I sent an ebay item to the required confirmed address. That address was not correct and Canada Post charged me money to return the item to me, plus the $56, ebay fees and paypal fees. I paid to ship with tracking number and everything. Ebay and Paypal ruled in my favor but the buyer charged back on the full amount. Not only did paypal not cover the charge back, but they charged me a chargeback fee as well. And all this after they ruled in my favor prior to the charge back. When I contacted paypal and asked what I have done wrong. I was told that I have done nothing wrong, that I did not qualify for the protection even though I submitted everything required. I was told it's the cost of doing business. Interesting because paypal won't take a loss, even with their promise of protection.\n\nAlso they hold money even after ebay buyers leave positive feedback. Their website says up to 24 hours after positive feedback. On the phone they tell me up to 3 days after positive feedback. Twice now I had to call them to release my funds and thats after 5 days of positive feedback.\n\nThey lie, they do what they want.
