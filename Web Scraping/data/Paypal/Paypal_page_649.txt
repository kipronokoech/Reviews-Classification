EBay rules it out in my favor obviously as this was far beyond the ebay protection time frame and the item was sold as not working properly anyway . PayPal on the other hand confiscated my money and refunded the buyer who in the meantime had completely damaged the item and removed key spare parts. . I appealed against the decision , and what happened was that after a very long process, third party reports , many phonecalls etc , paypal accepted to refund both me and the buyer . This was done after the case was finally closed against me , and after a kind customer support supervisor from Dublin named Mathew decided to look into the facts of what had actually happened rather than repeating a fixed monologue .\nI am happy that paypal finally realized that the seller needs to be protected as well , still i feel though they have a strong bias in favor of buyers . So i would be happy to use it as a buyer, but i would be cautious to sell something really valuable and accept paypal payment, as many people tend to abuse paypal\'s buyer protection', 'review_date': '2020-02-26', 'review_time': '17:44:54', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

Fortunately for trustpilot I know this is a total lie. Bottom line, PayPal is all good until you need fraud protection for something you bought. Then they are terrible.
