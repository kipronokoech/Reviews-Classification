The companies tendency to almost always side with a buyer even when the buyer is pulling an obvious scam or when the post office confirm the seller did send the item, the item was delivered and in some cases even when the post office provide evidence that the buyer even signed for an item they later claimed not to have received, has naturally lead to a huge increase in fraudulent charge-backs and buying scams. If you are a seller be very, very careful indeed whenever accepting payment via this company.\n\nThis charge-backs scam has become particularly popular on high ticket items such as laptops and so on, and in the space of one week 4 separate sellers that are on my Face Book list fell for the same scam.', 'review_date': '2012-02-01', 'review_time': '19:47:43', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
