I’ve dealt with them since 2003 and it started off great then when they split from eBay they were terrible but it seems they’ve listened to the complaints and started to sort things out and not take customers for granted. I rarely used them and always went for an alternative payment method because of my bad experiences (many) but I’ll give them another chance after they’ve been spot on helping me over the past couple of months. I just hope they don’t go back to their old ways. I’m not speaking on behalf of the many at this time but finally they’re coming good again and deserve credit.', 'review_date': '2021-05-18', 'review_time': '19:52:30', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

However, I got the message that I received 1735 euro, minus a transaction fee of 94,06 euro, so I received only 1640 euro.\nA few additional problems:\n- PayPal froze the money, and it took 9 days before I could access it, and then I sent it to my real bank account (but that takes 1 or 2 more days). This is extremely long???\n- Nowhere I could see how much my friend send me. They are absolutely not transparent. I had to ask my friend if he could see how much he send (in USD) and if he got the info about the fee/conversion rate (which I described above).\nI have no idea why PayPal does not communicate this to the receiver. This makes the system unusable and untrustable.\n- their fee calculator is completely false, when you enter the amounts there, you get some very positive outcome, but in reality I lost more then 100 euro more on this transaction.\n\nThe fair conversion rate at the time was 0.82. So I expected 1804 euro minus ~3% = 1750 euro. The fact that I received 1640 is dissappointing.\nI will never use this service again, they really need to be transparent about the fees.\nThe same amount on TransferWise would have saved me 100 euro's or at least 5% of the transaction sum, plus the money would have been in my account within 1 day, and with PayPal it takes 10 days right now!\nThe difference is too large!\n\nI have to admin that I still use Paypal for a montly subsribtion service, and that works flawless for years.\nTransfering money (usd to eur) is something PayPal is not suitable for at all!
