I have PAYPAL CREDIT which I use to pay for stuff. Years ago these f***** charged my bank account because it was defaulted as a backup in case I did not have enough credit. (Yes I know I am ghetto just pay minimum, but I will show you my plan :p) So I turn this option off to NEVER use my bank account to pay for anything. Just decline a transaction if I do not have enough funds which I always pay more upfront to be under my credit limit. Also, I don't even believe in debit cards. I just think its stupid and so easily accessed for someone to steal all your money & identity to have anything linked directly to your BANK ACCT. The ONLY reason I have my bank on the account is to pay the minimum payments monthly because thats the only thing they accept. Lo & behold a couple of f****** days ago these scumbags charge my Chewy order DIRECTLY OUT OF MY BANK ACCOUNT. I AM LIVID. What if I had no funds!!!??? I saw how much I needed to pay to honor my credit limit, but suddenly my balance is a few CENTS off even though I kept making more payments. This is the last straw. I am disgusted. I hate this f****** company as much as Wells Fargo. I will be paying my balance in full & closing this POS. I see some sheeple on the website defending them f****** ass eaters who are pathetic. The customer service is also the worst. WORD OF ADVICE YALL: REPORT THEM TO THE CFPB (Consumer Financial Protection Bureau) AND THE FINANCIAL OMBUDSMAN SERVICE!!!! They will listen then. Trust me. I just got refunded the fake conversion fees they charge. But finally I am paying off this account and closing it.
