I couldn\'t have been more wrong!\n\nA week later and over 10 interactions with paypal support later they finally log a manual dispute only to close it within less than a minute of opening it (going by the timestamps on the emails) saying they won\'t help because it was outwith 180 days (despite what one of their agents said in the 3rd reply).\n\n"Support" are pathetic, the majority clearly don\'t read anything that is sent to them and reply with nothing but automated responses - interestingly a bit like an automated program they seem to respond to key phrases in emails and send a different variant of the response when you say something such as "open manual dispute", "raise formal complaint" otherwise you get a generic "how to log an automated dispute" reply!\n\nI\'m genuinely wondering if they\'ve replaced their entire support team with an automated system at this point (if they haven\'t they should it would be a lot quicker at replying and would maintain the same quality of service they have now).\n\nAnyway rant over. With any luck someone else will enter the market with a decent service and start taking their market share, as right now they\'ve lost their way.

I get things sorted out with the bank, or at least I thought I had, and now paypal has flagged me as a security risk.\n\nTo verify my account, I must provide the 5 digit code they sent to a phone number I no longer have. I cannot update my phone number without accessing my account, but I cannot access my account without providing the 5 digit code they sent to a number I no longer have. So, round and round we go.\n\nAfter several hours and several phone calls back and forth... They sent me a 5 digit code to my old number AGAIN!!! So yet another call. I literally begged them to just close my account so we can start over, seeing as the verification process has its obvious flaws. Well, now they\'re saying they cannot close my account ... now get this... because the bank won\'t let them, because of the outstanding transaction... which can only be completed if and when I obtain the 5 digit code, which I need to verify, but the code keeps getting sent to a number I no longer have............. :(\n\nSo, now a supervisor is involved, trying to push the eBay transaction thru so I can cancel my account and set up a new one.... and end up right back where I started... after 6 hrs of what can only be described as utter insanity!. Moreover, if this supervisor is unsuccessful, I will be left with a paypal account I cannot possibly access, and will no longer be able to pay for online purchases with paypal... But hey! This is all for my online protection, right?!!\n\n... Well, it just keeps getting better... Now the bank, RBC, btw, is saying they don\'t see how they have anything to do with the situation, and it\'s an issue between me and paypal. I asked them to cancel the transaction so I could proceed with setting up a new paypal account, and they said only the vendor; who is "out of the office" can cancel it. So, if he doesn\'t, I\'m screwed... No more paypal... And an outstanding debt on my credit... And we all know where that leads. Thanks RBC, YOU ROTTEN F\'ers!!!\n\nWell, the issue finally got fixed...with no help from RBC I might add. After 9 hours of pleading, and letting more than a few expletives fly, I can now use my paypal account. But I can\'t get over the fact that RBC could stop the transaction on a whim, and then tell me 13.5 hrs later that they can\'t just cancel a transaction for no good reason... only the vendor can... Wow, talk about insulting one\'s intelligence :( .\n\n... High Time to pull my investments from RBC, me thinks.\n\nOh, forgot to mention... The thing that set off the red flag for RBC Visa? I was buying some solar equipment (a few flex panels in this case) from a vendor in China, something I have done many times over the past few years...thru eBay and paypal. So why the fuss one might ask? What I do know is, before leaving office, Harper put huge tariffs on all things solar and lithium coming out of China. And now, suddenly, a typical purchase is red flagged! The first person I spoke to at rbc this morning said when the bank sees solar purchases out of China they get suspicious. I assumed he was referring to the solar scams that do occasionally pop up on ebay... But now I\'m thinking it may go beyond that? I will update if my purchases get targeted again.
