Sadly she has now got to deal with some buyers raising cases and getting her money cleared because they have not received their items, a joke because they were sent by courier and tracked, instead of talking to the buyer and get the case closed YOU have to ask Paypal to resolve it and that is a pain.\n\nThese people need to be regulated like our UK banks and not just make decisions at the drop of a hat. Their customer service departments are rude and unwilling to deal with your dispute, same with Ebay as well, they like to tell you many a different tale.\n\nMaybe it needs people to vote with their feet and if necessary take the action required to make them sit up and listen.
