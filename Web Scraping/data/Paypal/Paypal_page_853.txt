I have a 100% positive feedback, over some years, with never a dispute, complaint or anything other than 1st class service. All of a sudden, with no prior warning, I am categorised as high risk, and all transactions put on hold or pending! One transaction was a refund from a reputable merchant, nothing to do with ebay, and still went into pending. When they finally released it, I went to transfer into bank account, and back into pending again!! This has happened with numerous transactions now, and contacting them is soooo painful. Apparently they have no option to review or make a decision, the 'system' does that and cannot be overridden??\nI could go on and on, but the CS is a department of script reading teenagers who actually became quite aggressive when I pressed a question!\nShocking, shocking company, and one I'll never use again.
