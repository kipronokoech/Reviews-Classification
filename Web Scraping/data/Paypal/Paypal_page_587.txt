My message is BEWARE OF THIS COMPANY AND USE THEM AT YOUR PERIL!!\nIn early April, I responded to an advert supposedly selling Makita power tools for a discounted price of about 80 USA dollars knocked down from about $250. Sadly, I fell for it and paid via PayPal as requested.\nBy the end of April, the goods had not arrived and, as there was no paperwork for the transaction from the seller, I contacted PayPal to see if they could help.\nThey opened up case number PP-D-63223147 for me and said they would contact the seller for me who was apparently in China. This surprised me as the original advert had led me to believe they were in USA...\nPeriodically, they send me an "update" with a resolution date. This was originally May 17th. They then told me they needed more information from the seller and gave them three days to respond (I assumed, therefore, May 20th).\nThe date then got put back to May 25th; then to May 31st; then to June 1st and is currently back to June 5th.\nI have tried to phone them on a number of occasions to try to discuss this with them. The automated system takes you down various blind alleys until it cuts you off due to Covid 19!!\nThey don\'t appear to have an email contact or web chat facility so it just becomes a waiting game.\nPayPal clearly have no intention of refunding my money or of actually resolving the case - the goods have still not arrived - as they are clearly holding all the cards (i.e. my money).\nThe lessons I would pass on are:\n1. Don\'t buy anything off an advert - I\'ve always been amazed when people get scammed like this in the past am rather embarrassed to admit that I\'ve now fallen foul of this racket too!\n2. Avoid using PayPal at all costs. They\'re not interested in providing any sort of customer service and appear to be as big a scammer as the companies that insist on using this as the sole means of payment. I suspect they are in cahoots with the criminal sellers who they clearly make a substantial profit from with the fraudulent transactions operated by their system.\nSurprise Surprise! PayPal managed to miss their June 5th deadline and have just told me now (June 9th) about this. They are now saying June 11th but I somehow suspect that this won\'t happen either...\nAnd what a surprise - they\'ve now pushed it back to June 18th! My real thoughts about this shambles of a company are not printable I\'m afraid!!\nSurprise surprise!! This morning, I\'ve had a message to say that Pay Pal have reviewed the case in my favour and that they will be refunding the money to my card.
