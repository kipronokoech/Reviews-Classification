I called January 16 for 10 mins, January 18 for 53 minutes talking to dept manager AND Jan 19 16 mins.... and Currently been on hold 2 and a half hours!!!!! I submitted ALL information for the case for paypal sent all the pictures of the part, screen shot of eBay listing clearly outlining no returns stated in two places AND all other information provided they rules in customers favor AND refunded the customer! I was told it was buyers remorse by an associate and not to worry and get an email next day that they sided with customer and sent me a tracking number for the merchandise to be returned.... it said it was delivered it never was and now we are here. I suspended my eBay account I REFUSE TO DO BUSINESS WITH PAYPAL! I have used them for many years and had 1000s come through my account.

I was very stupid and naive to give them 5 stars rating NEVER AGAIN. We run a small online and offline businesses. Last October a lady had purchased a pair of earrings and it was a beautiful pair of Earrings made with Swarovski Crystal stones by Krystal London. They were long Sandeliar with lots of work with exactly pictures and descriptions. The lady called 2 days later and started to abuse me on the phone and threatened me that she will send them to the trading standards. She also told me that one earring was broken so I knew that she was a bad customer and a liar because she told me that she went to Swarovski showroom and the manager said this earrings are not made by Swarovski. I told the lady that we have not said that they made by Swarovski. Swarovski sells more stones than Jewelery round the world. So one day in October 2017 we had received a dispute email from Paypal. We had appealed and said that we have not received the products. They gave me the tracking number over the phone and the gentleman said that said that the person called NORIS had signed the parcel so I told him that we only have Tapas Chatterjee ( myself) and my daughter also help me after school and her name is Alicia Chatterjee. But according to the Paypal we have received the products. After several harassment I have repeatedly told them that I am not going to pay something We have not received? They have threatened me that they will suspend our account so I told them that we will never use PayPal and they are expensive anyway. They charge heavy and poor exchange rates. They pass debt to the DLC who I spoke to few times and they are very polite and listens to you. I told them that we have a 24/7 CCTV coverage so I have asked them to obtain the coverage from our landlord which we can't obtain. But Paypal is like a child and they say the tracking number is showing the parcel has delivered to your address. I said that the parcel has not come to us and gone to the wrong address so if someone has signed so it will show that we have received but we have not and we will FIGHT to the end and never will pay something we have not received. I told them repeatedly that take us to the court and we will fight and get the justice and then Sue Paypal for the constant harassment.We have been using Paypal over 6 years and never happened before..... so We will never use them or recommend NOBODY.....", 'review_date': '2018-01-22', 'review_time': '14:01:19', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
