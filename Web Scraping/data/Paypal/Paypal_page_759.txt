He was rude, pompous and would NOT pass me to a supervisor or remove the late fee.\n\nI explained that this is how we have always done it and we have never recieved any emails stating we were going to be charged a late fee.\n\nHow is it possible that you can be charged a late fee for being late and for being a day or two early? Unexplainable from Jason. Plus, he didn\'t care what-so-ever!\n\nI explained I spent thousands with him and I wasn\'t afraid to cancel my accounts with him. His response " well then that $27.00 shouldn\'t mean much to you and you shouldn\'t let it ruin your day".\n\nI found that to be the rudest comment, so I kindly reminded him that his phone calls were recorded and just how unkind that would sound if his CEO heard how responded to me. He stopped speaking for a moment. I also let him know that an email would nice to let me know that they were charging me a late fee and if they could produce that I could understand. I have received all sorts of credit emails but, no late fee email.\n\nI also let him know I would be sharing this on social media, he said well "do what you have to". Again, not his money, not his company so he really didn\'t care.\n\nHow is it possible that they receive a payment for one month early in that month. Get another payment last day of the month for the next month...consider it the "same billing month" and bill me $27.00 late fee because it isn\'t applied towards the next month? How many payment does one make in a one month period? Seriously. I don\'t pay my bills on the exact day...what if it went in the mail and they receieved it early or late??? Then what? Would it be early or late? No one can guarentee the mail delivers on a certain day.\n\nDONE with PayPay. They lost thousands of dollars worth of business for $27.00 charge that they made up. But, Jason said it was o.k. so I guess it was he must make the calls around there.\n\nSee ya!', 'review_date': '2019-03-10', 'review_time': '16:20:59', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

She stated that they were too long and wanted to return them.\nShe returned a totally different item that was very cheaply made, which we would never sell. We contacted her to send the original pants back and that we would return the skirt she substituted if she paid for the shipping.\nShe then filed a complaint with PayPal stating that we wouldn't credit her account.\nWe sent pictures of the item she bought and the one she returned to PayPal and they decided in the customer's favor and charged us back $233.24. PayPal then stated that we could appeal the case by filling out and signing a notarized affidavit stating that a different item had been returned.\nAfter sending PayPal the affidavit, they still decided in the customer's favor. This is obviously a scam on the part of Leslie Schaar, whom I'm guessing has performed this fraud before, and PayPal allows it.
