Having selected this it required the opening of a PayPal credit account. This was automated and very soon i received £900 odd credit limit, more than enough for the cleaner.\nThereafter i expected to see the amount i had spent and the amount i would need to pay per month to settle the account.\nNot anything like that. It turned out that i had simply opened a Paypal credit account under their normal terms, not with an option to pay over 12 months with no interest.\nThen it gets worse - try and contact them! Its incredibly difficult to get a reply at all. Then when you want to complain they 'recommend' you call them by phone where there is no record. I did finally find a 'form' to file a complaint but they ignored it. I called and filed another through the assistant on the phone and that one got answered very quickly but simply dismissed by representations saying the correct instalment plan had not been chosen. I asked when? where? No reply.\nIm trying to compile evidence to show how i have tried to sort things out before going to the Financial Services Ombudsman but its almost impossible.\nIf you use Paypal credit be very very careful.

I raised a claim and my claim was denied for surprise, from paypal also no proper explanation except the copy and paste ready snippet. 2. I had $4 in my account, they said one attempt to transfer to bank is failed so send the money as DD, and most hilariously the DD costed me $10 and my account changed from +$4 to -$6.

It wanted to verify me with a sms message code, however as I have emigrated I no longer have that mobile number. There is no way to update your number and the customer help were of no use either. They advised I can't use my existing account in Australia and would have to setup a new one. If i wanted into my old account I needed to call the UK PayPal support on international charge rates. If anyone has called PayPal you will know the wait times are horrific and when you do speak to a half robot script reading human they often cut you off when their script does not hold the answers to simple questions.\n\nThe fun does not stop there though. As advised I opened up a new PayPal account in Australia to use with my existing ebay account. I sent all of the required documents and started selling on ebay. Once my first sale had gone through over $1500, PayPal transfered the money into their account and took off their percentage for the 'service' they were providing then swiftly put my account on a permanent bann.\n\nWith this bann in place I now cannot access my funds for 180 days (6months) and when trying to question the reasons behind the bann paypal either ignore all emails or copy and paste the decision is final with no explanation or opportunity to resolve.\n\nThere are horror stories online that paypal will also keep the money for themselves after the 180 days with no explanation.
