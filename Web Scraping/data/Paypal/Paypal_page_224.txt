They say said my account was full updated but come to find out they had and issue with their ‚Äúsystem‚Äù where it was not paying off balances of promo but actually taking my standard purchases and paying them off in small chucks then spreading my payments across all the promo balances. They start charging me 400 up to 600 over the next 5 months. A employee caught the error and they didn‚Äôt fix it right away instead they said I owe them 700 because now all the standard purchases were now due. I talked to several people and they all said we are sorry we see the work order but there is nothing we can due even though the error was theirs and said we will have it fixed after a couple of billing cycles. Meanwhile I still had to make high payments. PayPal you are a rip off trying to take money from your customer by paying small increment across purchases then going back and charge interest if they make minimal payment over the time. This should be illegal. A company that rips off its customer to charge them more money and fees even when you pay on time', 'review_date': '2022-02-25', 'review_time': '09:53:00', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
