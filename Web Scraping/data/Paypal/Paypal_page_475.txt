After the item arrived nearly 3 weeks late after being told it would take 5 to 8 days. Livll say you can cancel their order within 14 days of purchase. Yet they did not cancel my order and the watch arrived faulty with broken glass face and give inaccurate readings in Steps and Distance when compared to my other fitness watch and GPS Apps on my Mobile Phone. I was advised by Paypal to send to an address in Hong Kong: Pay Pal asked me to return the item to: NO RETURN CHINA, 1234AB NL, on the 8th September. This was obviously and deliberately in my view the wrong returns address, given by Livell. I was notified by Paypal on the 6th of October that the returns address was: Postbus111, 3400 AC, IJsselstein, Netherlands.\nI have just contacted Paypal and been told the Dutch Address is wrong. I pointed out that this was the address they sent me and confirmed on the Livell Website. I was told to email them yet received message "Thanks for contacting us. We want to help you as quickly and efficiently as possible but we can’t answer emails sent to this unmonitored mailbox." Having spent good 40 minutes on the phone to someone in the Philippines. I was cut off. I had advised Pay Pal today, that the Post Office Track and Trace said item was delivered but advised" our delivery partner tried to deliver your parcel on 20-10-2020 but there didn\'t seem to be anyone in. They’ve left a note about how to make further arrangements." Paypal now are saying that I had sent item to wrong address and cannot cancel the transaction for payment. This has been going on since June. It is very difficult to call them, as they often have no one to answer the phone. Nor can I post message online. When I did get through I was told to email them but they do not reply to their email. They also said that concerning faulty items from Hong Kong, UK does not Apply. They agreed on the 31st October, to apply full refund after having spent nearly 2 hours on the phone! Admiting it was their mistake they had provided three different delivery addresses (2 in HK and the other NL). My advice is to use your Credit Card only Not Debit Card. As your Credit Card gives the consumer additional protection, there is therefore no need to use Paypal, who provide an appalling customer service!', 'review_date': '2020-11-01', 'review_time': '20:26:28', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
