Initially I was scammed by another company (vipper.com), but I was suspicious before I made my purchase on their website, so to be safe I paid via Paypal as I wanted to make sure I could easily get my money back if it turned out to be a scam, which it was. I filed for a refund through Paypal and then suddenly 15 days later I get another email from Paypal saying that the deadline for escalating my claim was yesterday and now it is impossible to reopen the case.\nI received NO email from Paypal warning me that I would need to escalate the claim within a certain amount of time or else I would lose all right to get my money back. Apparently in the first email I received from Paypal confirming that I had filed for a refund if I had scrolled to the bottom I could have read that I needed to escalate the claim before 14 days or else all was lost. But even if I had read that (which NO ONE reads) it still did not say that you can ONLY ESCALATE A CLAIM AFTER 7 DAYS! So was I supposed to have logged on to my Paypal every day to see if today was the day that I could finally escalate my claim?? This is obviously a way for Paypal to trick their customers into not realizing that they need to "escalate" their claim, by not telling you when it\'s even possible to escalate and also by putting the escalation deadline (which is IMPORTANT INFORMATION!) at the bottom of an email and also sending no warning emails that you are about to lose your right to escalate your claim.\nI thought Paypal was a legit company, but this is scam-like behaviour.
