Also, I thought it was really great when they suspended the fee on instant transfers, because of Covid-19. However, overall, my experience with PayPal demonstrates that they are biasedly obliged to their sellers (aka. their income channels) than they are their buyers.\n\nMy most recent experiences, involving Banggood, only emphasize this. Ironically, I opted to pay using PayPal because I thought it would add an extra layer of protection. It didn\'t. Banggood scammed me by billing me more on the PayPal transaction then what was listed on their own invoice. They shipped me defective products, then tried to get me to agree to a partial refund of $1.44. When I decided to bring PayPal into it, they simply were complicit with Banggood\'s scammy, unethical practices. They try to hide behind policies and the old "we\'re just the neutral party" excuse most marketplaces and similar companies try to use. They\'re definitely a party to Banggood\'s unethical practices! Overall, I cannot recommend PayPal.', 'review_date': '2020-08-10', 'review_time': '21:42:24', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

Even my personal bank has managed to make transactions much easier and answer questions within minutes. Their main product isn\'t even payment services! How does PayPal get this so wrong?

I work in Fintech and I see these issues less and less with companies who\'s main products are not payment related.
