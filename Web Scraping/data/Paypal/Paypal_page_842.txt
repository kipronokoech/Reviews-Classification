There are many other companies that accept online payments (Robokassa, Yandex.Cass, Webmoney, Qiwi, RBK Money, etc., etc.). Paypal is simply the worst, for both seller and buyer. Do not make a mistake, do not sign up with Paypal !!! This applies to both private accounts and business accounts. 1. Paypal has the worst conditions for online stores according to tariffs and conditions. 2. Paypal will constantly block your money, for various reasons, from "financial regulator requirements" that lie to the most general blocking of funds for no reason. We had frozen 3 Paypal accounts for 2 years! We lost during this time dozens of hours for calls, correspondence. We constantly had to waste time on Paypal, hand over in each case of blocking, dozens of personal and corporate documents. Looks like that they just collect personal data. 3. No support absolutely, you will communicate with robots by phone and mail .. You will spend a lot of your valuable time, which could be spent on business.

I personally have an account since 2001 and with minor hiccups i would say my experience wasn't that nightmarish. However, i understood through empirical experience what they've reservations were provoked by.\nSo i created the account and used a generic name for the account instead of some real person. The person responsible for the account may change at any time and i didn't want to go through the painful process of name change (i realized the pain afterwords) every time we make a change. Anything else was just fine, provided my SSN (being currently the account administrator), business name, business bank account, address, were approved for a 501.c.10 non profit org which adjusts the fees, etc. All went well and we started operating. We received few donations, moved funds between accounts, one would say - wow, it is so easy, i can't imagine why everyone is so negative about the experience with PayPal.\nWell, until one day I decided to place a request for they PayPal Here, and then and there all hell broke loose.\nFirstly, my account immediately rendered inoperable. Suddenly all the information we provided when opening the account was deemed unsatisfying some requirements. I was asked to provide additional 5 documents, plus changing the name on the account. That was on June 27th.\nI thought, well these are their requirements, i will comply. Provided most of the required documents, in random order, then the last document i submitted was the formal letter for name change, on a corporate letterhead, etc. Then waited. 10 days later, this past friday, i made a call and was connected with a gentleman (i call him now gentleman simply because i didn't got his name), told him the reason of my call and asked for assistance.\nWell, no chance of getting one. He was utterly unprofessional, his passive-aggressive demeanour drove me to the point of asking for his manager. He responded that there is one available and he will put me through then he came back and said - there is no one working that day, so in the next 24-48 hours i will receive a call. At the time of writing this is past 48 hours.\nAnyhow, i few hours later i called back and spoke with someone else. In fact, very nice lady who listed to my story, restored all previously uploaded document, which her colleague removed/deleted from the history of the case and promised to follow up as soon as i upload the last required document - my SS card.\nLater that day i asked myself, why are you so masochistically continue dealing with them, while you can call WF and get the same service, discount, discount and most importantly - customer service. The answer, because i can't even close the account now, until i go through all nine circles of hell. Once i change the name i will close the account and never think twice again opening another one with PayPal. I called WB and arranged all i needed in a less than 15 phone conversation - DONE, PERIOD.", 'review_date': '2017-08-13', 'review_time': '22:55:06', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
