The felt was damaged and had to cut off a piece of wood to actually fix the door on but whatever I say or do that I wanted a £150-£300 partial refund out of £575 on the shed for all the trouble and waiting 4 months for the delivery Paypal rejected the claim to say I shouldn't have made up the shed and that I should've known already that the shed wasn't up to standards. So how am I going to know that until it actually comes to building the shed in the first place Paypal think that you should be sykick and should know that the shed isn't what it was supposed to be.\nAs I waited 4 months for the shed and my equipment getting ruined outside the whole point in having a shed I have explained to them what was wrong with the shed loads and loads of times and they are just plain not interested and don't give a $hit they are always on the sellers side.

Just the most awful service you can ever get and they just make excuses for them and not interested in your claim.
