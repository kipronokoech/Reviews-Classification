They tried it last year with terrible uproar to take it back, but they try this when a pandemic happens & sellers have little sales & no, or very delayed, government support?\n\nIt it vile that they are taking money out of the accounts of people for buyer's cancellations at any time, but to do it now when there are businesses shut down everywhere & they cry victim, because they 'do the work regardless'. I find it false and shameful. WE all do work regardless, including ebay who refunds fees and is in fact supporting sellers with less fees, not more. And sellers do the work also regardless of the cancellation, but they get charged. And this doesn't count that Paypal has been collecting for YEARS - 20-30p unrefundable per transaction fees. May seem small to us, but I'd guess with millions of sellers and transactions, and cancellations that is a pretty penny - but unsatisfied with that amount of non-refundable fee, the interest they collect on all fees, the money they rake in - they say, we want more! We did the work - but so did everyone, and it was the buyer who changed their mind. But to know how poorly this was received in the past - and then do it at the very beginning of a month that was now known to be a pandemic and never question their action as lockdown occurred and so many are struggling with no business, no work, government is trying to subsidise, the NHS are pulling their weight and more, front line staff in various industries are pulling to help in this unprecedented event - and Paypal, questions nothing about their support and keeps claiming more money for their poor beleaguered share holders who find that several millions are not quite good enough. I hope others will support me, and other online sellers, to call out Paypal and ask - what are you doing, with a major, multi-national, billions in currency corporation doing to support the public - your customers, your bread and butter, in this unprecedented time in history.\n\nI wrote to them to ask about this, to which I heard nothing. I said in this time of a line of social consciousness of those ignoring social distancing and keeping things bad, to those going above and beyond to the call - which side of the line do you fall?

I have been a Paypal user since 2011. But never had I has such terrible experiences with not only their service but also with their customer service. With everything going on with COVID19 they have shut down their call centers, you are only able to send messages and there is never someone live that you can talk to. They get on to respond when they feel like it, of course it is when you're no longer logged on, you don't get a notification, they don't assist you or respond to what you requested/asked and just say they will wait for you to log back on. And when you do, lo and behold, no one is available. More than a month ago they changed all of my billing agreements to charge to my checking account instead of my credit card account. I found out at the end of Feb, but the website would not allow me to change the agreements myself. So I had to send a message. I probably had to request the same change to my billing agreements at least 5 times until someone actually did it, or at least told me they changed it on March 1st. Then in the last week and a half, there was a $120.55 charge that I had cancelled with the company directly, but the following week not only did Paypal charge me for it, but they also took it out of my checking account. During this crisis when everything is struggling to make ends meet, they took $120 out of my bank account. But it doesn't stop there. While I am getting no assistance from their customer service there are also 4-5 $2 charges to my checking account that I never authorized that I had to contact them about. And then there is a Disney+ subscription charge to my checking account. So once again here I am trying to deal with customer service and getting no help. One girl in the last week said all of my billing agreements except Grubhub is set to my credit card. Today I am told that Disney+ was only changed in the last 72 hours and that's why is charged my checking account, once again I requested this to be changed on March 1st and this charge went through on March 23rd. After the 5th time of request a manager to contact me, I get a call from a man that says that all of my accounts are changed to my credit card except Itunes. So they all still haven't been changed. He has nothing to say to me except to offer to change that. The website won't even allow me to remove my checking account or payment methods, so I am going to have to send a message to customer service and argue with them to get them to lift a finger to assist me. I will never use Paypal again. It says a lot that they choose the COVID19 crisis to start taking everyone's money without permission and they have zero customer service to assist you, oh and they don't care about any of it.", 'review_date': '2020-03-29', 'review_time': '19:19:19', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
