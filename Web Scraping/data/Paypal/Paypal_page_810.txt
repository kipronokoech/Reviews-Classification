Imagine my surprise when on 14/5/2018 the payment was deducted again this time unauthorised. I then went through the nightmare of trying to contact Paypal to report this unauthorised payment, there contact details are very hard to find and use as they are hidden behind many identity checks and then reply with emails that are pre-prepared and do not apply to your issue.\nFinally they wash their hands and advise you they have reconsidered the case and find you are at fault and therefore not covered by their protection plan.\n\nI have since cancelled my Paypal account and would recommend that people take care when dealing with these rogues. They are always updating their conditions of service so you as the end user lose out all the time.', 'review_date': '2018-05-15', 'review_time': '05:35:06', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

It gives you an error "error sending message". Which means you can\'t get help by email.\n\nThere is a long thread regarding this issue on their forums with hundreds of people complaining and yet no Paypal official has commented on it.\n\n2) Tried to call once, getting through their automatic machine is extremely painful and I didn\'t get anywhere after 20 minutes.\n\n3) Messaged them on Facebook. Here again, getting through their answering bot to get to a real person is extremely painful. I managed to get the bot option which allowed me to get help from a real person, however nobody actually answered. How helpful.\n\nIn resume: my account is limited and I can\'t do anything about it, and I can\'t even withdraw the money I have on it.\n\nThis is not the first time I have issues with PayPal.\n\nThey once threatened to suspend my account after I requested 2 refunds in a row (I\'m so sorry for getting scammed *sarcasm*).\n\nI once sold a mint state iPhone on ebay, and the customer asked to return it 200 days later (!!) and it was broken and filed for a refund on Paypal. PayPal heard evidence from both sides and they still refunded him half of the payment, which means I lost 300 euros and all I had was a broken iPhone.\n\nThis is extremely ridiculous.\n\nPS : they are holding hostage money a friend sent me, it has been sitting on my account for 2 months and I can\'t get access to it.', 'review_date': '2020-03-20', 'review_time': '15:44:59', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
