Funnily enough I wasn't able to as my purchase wasn't finalised on their website (none of my purchases spanning 5 years were), so I lodged a claim through PayPal. PayPal advised me that the seller would refund me after I paid for the return of the goods. PayPal has a system in place that does not allow you to question this practice. They also provided an incorrect return address not once, but twice. I spent two n a half hours on the phone. The first call after I explained the issue put me on hold, then hung up on me. The second call I was on hold for another 45 minutes using their 'one time code'. I realized this identified me and my too hard problem so I rang again, without my identifying code and got though to a human who promptly transferred me. In the meantime I used PayPals online chat service such a great timesaver apparently. On the last phonecall it was made clear to me that the seller can stipulate whatever they like, PayPal will not back you. They offer through a third party to refund shipping costs (up to $45) & so they have absolutely no financial interest in helping buyers. It has taken three weeks for me to get a return address from PayPal via their time saving online msg service, long after the cutoff date for me to respond. I was able to get the address within 2 minutes. The last consultant actually recommended I go to my credit card people for a refund. It is fascinating to come across an organization that has such a disregard for it's clients. Needless to say I will PayPal no more.", 'review_date': '2020-10-25', 'review_time': '01:57:39', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

After spending hours experiencing problems trying to make a purchase on Ebay, I contacted Ebay for advice.

And my account balance on Paypal is apparently zero?!!!!!! So WHERE has my money gone?\n\nNow panicking, I called Paypal - but the line wouldn't connect. Tried again, and line wouldn't connect. Tried a third time - line suddenly connected. Then I was told by the automated service that the customer services department had closed at 6.30pm (I was making the call at just gone 5pm). I tried doing E-chat on their website.... no response after 2 hours. Tried e-mailing them: but there's no option to email regarding potential fraud on transactions that aren't showing (well, my £535 isn't showing because you've stolen it!). I found another number for Paypal - called them. Terrible IVR / automated service on the line - no options were relevant or pertained to suspected fraud, so I got through to a stage where the automated system asked me for the reason of my call. I advised 'suspected fraud', to which it told me the automated service couldn't help, and directed me to the website!!!!\n\nCATCH TWENTY-TWO.
