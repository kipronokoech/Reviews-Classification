Oddly, the first time I tried it, my computer was somehow hacked, and I began receiving multiple messages from sites purporting to be Paypal, but which were phony. The hacker had managed to get ahold of the basic data I'd typed in, and I had to immediately close my account. However, the next time I used Paypal, it was because it was required by the vendor. This time, everything was smooth as silk, and I have never had a single problem during the 3-4 years I've been using the service. It allows you to make purchases without having to locate your credit card or bank account information, and now I am always pleased when Paypal is available as a way to pay for purchases or transfer funds.
