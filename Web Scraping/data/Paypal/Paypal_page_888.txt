They do have kind agents, but the overall RUNNING of PayPal and the way the company/system is hardlined to work causes constant problems where the only solution that exists is to call to ask for a security override in order to simply earn a 15 minute window of getting work done to send payments, and after that time period is up you're forced to call back and start the security-override-request process over again. They are inconsistent with their messaging and overall impossible to use, causing at least a month's delay in sending payments out.

Buyer asked if package can be packed in an additional box so her/his daughter would not know right away that she got a computer for her birthday. Which I did and by the way it cost me extra $7.95 for shipping because of the size of the box.It was Christmas time and I even decided to pay even more for faster delivery just to make people happy.
