I patiently waited for 21 days to get my money. When I finally got it, I tried to transfer it to my bank account and I had to wait for 1 day because they needed to review something (they never explained what they needed to review) ...\n2) I received another two payments on the 17th of May and they limited my account until I could prove that it was a legit transaction and that the item was delivered.\n3) When the above was resolved and the limitation was lifted, they decided to put those 2 payments on hold because I hadn't had receive money in my account for a while??? This doesn't make sense as I received money from a previous transaction on the 3rd as mentioned.\nIn conclusion, be aware and avoid PayPal as they will keep your money as much as they can.", 'review_date': '2021-05-29', 'review_time': '10:24:43', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
