If you use PayPal your protection, from not getting goods for example is with them. If you use ur bank card, it is with the bank. The disputes process with a bank is much much easier than dealing with PayPal. I have had to raise cases for issues with goods, with the bank and with PP. With the bank it was one phone call, PP it was several calls and weeks of chase up calls, with the dreaded response of we are ‚Äúinvestigating‚Äù. To use PP you generally have an account, of which I have had fraud on it, twice. Which is ironic because it‚Äôs advertised as a secure payment system, but having an account with them results in fraud and exposes your bank card to fraud through ur PP account. My personal advice, use ur bank card for internet purchases. Do not use PayPal and do not have ur card saved with them. I do not understand the service this company offers. The bank offers a better service for secure payments and any issues with internet purchases. I do not understand why PP exists, as everything they claim to offer it is already there with your bank.', 'review_date': '2019-07-24', 'review_time': '23:48:37', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
