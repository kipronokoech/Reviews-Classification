One is my original what i have had for years and my other one was to make a new Depop account.\n\nOn my new account i received a message to say I had made an order of ¬£79.99 to Game Ltd. This was not me. I told Paypal where they told me to inform the retailer. I emailed Game asking them to cancel whatever this transaction was in which they advised me the transaction was a digital transaction and was downloaded so couldnt be cancelled. I then informed Paypal again. I changed my passwords, i removed my bank details from my account. I was back and fourth with Pyapal i must say about 12 times. They opened a dispute and then closed it informing me theres not enough evidence? Then they appealed it after me complaining and im still waiting for an answer. This was all in August, its now November. People say "go with Paypal is safer for your money" well its clearly not.\n\nOn my old/original account somebody made a purchase of ¬£135 for a coat that cost over ¬£300. They paid this over two weeks ago and the payment has always been on hold. It then said to access the money i need to show proof of postage, which i did with tracking, and i would receive it within 1 day of delivery. The buyer received the coat over 48 hours ago and i still havent received it. I have raised this with them where ive heard no response. On the home screen on the website it says "send money in seconds" Ok well its not exactly sending money anywhere other than Paypals own bank for no reason!!!\n\nDon\'t bother with Paypal.', 'review_date': '2019-11-15', 'review_time': '10:04:59', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
