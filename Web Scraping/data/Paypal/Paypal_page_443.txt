Transaction complete. Well I got 1 dollar in gas when the pump shut off. For 7 days I believe I begged them for my money. I really did not eat for 4 of those days. We both had proof. Transaction number from PayPal Transaction number where PayPal had taken it out of her bank. She’s still trying to get that money. Her bank is having to get 30 dollars that PayPal stole! I’ll never forget begging for the money that they had just so I could eat! Never again Cash App never had a problem. Google pay never a problem. Apple Pay not a problem!

However when the item didn’t arrive I reported it to PayPal, they said I must give the seller a chance to resolve the matter, so I contacted them, and was advised that the order was on its way but they couldn’t provide tracking details until the parcel was in the UK. After another 2 emails to the seller I was advised the order had been lost in transit and a new one would be sent, however this failed to arrive either so I opened a case with PayPal, and surprise surprise the seller provided PayPal with tracking details saying the first order was delivered, 2 months before my case was raised and lo and behold PayPal contacted me and said as the seller had provided the tracking details my case was being declined. This is the second such issue I have had and both times PayPal agreed with the seller, so in my opinion the ‘buyer guarantee’ is just a marketing ploy to get people to use their device and actually doesn’t cover anything, they are totally on the sellers side. I can say that I will no longer be using PayPal to purchase goods, will be closing my account with them, and will be putting reviews like this on any other review sites I can find in the hope they actually read one!\nBeware when using PayPal as it’s not all it is reported to be!', 'review_date': '2020-12-03', 'review_time': '23:32:00', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
