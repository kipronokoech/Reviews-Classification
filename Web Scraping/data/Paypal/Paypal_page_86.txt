Basically, a password reset was how the CSR tried to fix my concern, when I wanted them to investigate how their software was vulnerable to a fraudulent repeating transaction. The CSR then hung up on me.\n\nSo.. I call back. The CSR who answered this time pretended they couldn't hear me on the phone. So they hang up on me too. Then, the first CSR calls back, and leaves me a voicemail that claims we got disconnected, AND that she couldn't hear me.\n\nSo.. was it a disconnection, or no audio in the call? These stories conflict, and it tells me that the PayPal customer service reps use these tactics to end calls that they don't want to deal with.\n\nIn conclusion, PayPal staffs deceitful customer service reps, who are only there to try and placate customers by reading a script.
