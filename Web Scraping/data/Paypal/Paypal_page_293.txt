Recently, my online accounts were compromised (no idea how, as I'm always very careful with my online presence), and my Paypal via Google Pay was used to set up a recurring app subscription to something called +10 Life (Red Rain) to the tune of ¬£43.49 per week. Luckily, I caught the transaction, not quickly enough to prevent the initial charge to go through, but quickly enough to cancel the subscription and remove my payment methods from my PayPal account. It was then that I discovered that Google had, thankfully, declined 2 earlier attempted transactions for ¬£259 for +10 Life (Dont Tap), and ¬£129 for +10 Life (Jumping Animals). I later found that these transactions were made in Russia, and the apps were sold by a Russian vendor (I'm in the UK). I opened a dispute with PayPal, originally for Fraud/Unauthorised Transaction, but changed to Goods/Service Not Received. I provided them with a chat transcript from Google Pay support, and a screen print of the attempted transactions, along with the single successful one, as proof of the declined attempts, and the location of the successful one. I was informed that the transaction would be investigated, and that Google would have until 19 August to respond with further information to support my claim, and that if they received no response, they would automatically find in my favour, and issue a refund. This was on 7 August. I received an email today stating:\n\nWe received the claim(s) you opened on 7 August 2021.\n\nWe've reviewed the transaction(s) and are denying your claim(s). This decision was made because we never received documentation that proves you are due a credit.\n\nWe're sorry for any problems you may have experienced with the transaction(s).\n\nI've checked with Google Pay support, who kindly informed me that they've yet to receive any information request from PayPal. PayPal have provided no information on how they arrived at their decision, and have stonewalled my attempts to appeal their findings, or provide additional supporting information. Couple this with the frustrating lack of clarity using the PayPal resolution centre, or the attempts to fob you off with automated responses instead of speaking to a person, and I've found, along with the vast majority of others leaving their review here, that PayPal cares little for their customers when fraud is apparent. A shockingly poor level of customer care, and I'll not be using PayPal again.", 'review_date': '2021-08-13', 'review_time': '19:04:29', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

I own a business that uses multiple payment portals, and some people just like to use PayPal, so we had their service available. We did business together for nearly seven years. But truth be told, it only worked for about 50% of our clientele that tried to use it. Then one day, they decided to close my account, without any prior notification or pre-existing problems. I could have cared less, but they kept $1000 of my money without any explanation as to why. When we called in to talk to them about it, the reps told us some ‚Äúsecret division‚Äù made this decision and it was final. When you asked to speak to someone in that ‚Äúsecret division,‚Äù they reps tell you that they don‚Äôt take phone calls. All they can do is tell you what the decision was. Meanwhile, you then end up in some mindless web of messaging through the PayPal app, where they respond with a handful of condescending form letters until you get frustrated and just give up. So if you‚Äôre looking for an archaic payment portal that only works have the time, and then ultimately steals from you; then PayPal is your bet.
