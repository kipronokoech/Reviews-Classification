Why would any customer spend time, pay the postage which is as much as the original purchase price in order to get the refund?\n\nWhen I contacted gearbest.com for describing how the crash cam could not start (I have also attached photos of the faulty product and sent them) they replied to me and said they also want to see the video of the faulty crash cam and asked me to take videos of the misbehaving crash cam and upload it to youtube.com for them to see.

Why should I bother logging into Paypal to pay for any transaction if I'm not protected? Many online stores charge extra for paying using Paypal.\nThis Chinese scam online store GearBest.com is partnering with PayPal to deceive customers and making profits. PayPal is no longer effectively protecting consumers and in fact PayPal is one of the most dangerous payment method online shoppers are using now.
