Twice i had problems with sellers, and paypal didnt bother to check information i sent. And believe me when i complained, i was 100% sure for my info. Twice they favor the seller. The first time though, i went through Mastercard. They accepted my info because it was detailed and they spent time to assess all info. Keep in mind that paypal says to sellers that will not involve with claims coming from card's company. That should give a clue that paypal willingly favors to sellers. I am willing to do the same again. I have more trust to companies like Mastercard and Visa than Paypal. I am willing, where i can to, to use card directly than Paypal. I have a debit card connected to an empty account and i will use only this one and next time i will have a problem with a seller i will file a complaint directly to company. Paypal is a largest fruad than some sellers.
