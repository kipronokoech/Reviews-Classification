PayPal is a "BUYER BEWARE" company. They will not enforce fraud claims unless you can submit PROOF that only a paid lawyer could obtain.. If the seller offers to refund after item is returned to wherever THEY CHOOSE and at YOUR TIME AND EXPENSE, PayPal will consider problem solved , case closed. This is the solution i was offered to fraudulent sale claim. I still haven\'t even received the item at the time of this writing.....Bottom Line - PayPal is a FREE to use purchase middleman for those of us who don\'t want to give seller our bank or card info . PayPal relies on seller to resolve problems. IF you buy from a respected, customer oriented, U.S. BASED company you will never need to see PayPal\'s REAL BUYER PROTECTION. For known problem companies outside the U.S. you can 1- eat it, and forget it ever happened. 2- hire a lawyer. 3- Do your homework on the company your buying from. 4- pay more attention to the negative reviews because positive reviews are very easy to fake and widely used to boost sales....I have and will continue to use PayPal for the many big box and U.S. based companies without any problems.

All of the fraud occurred on the same device. I also used the SAME device to report the fraud to you immediately.\n\nIn the interim since your last message I did receive a set of earphones from the vendor\n\nI contacted him numerous times for a return since I did NOT order these. He has not responded even once despite me mentioning that the package has not even been opened and that I did not order it.\n\nI also took the package to the local Apple store for an evaluation. Apple has identified the headphones as complete knockoffs, not genuine Beats headphones (the Beats brand is wholly owned by Apple).\n\nSo you have a customer who legitimately got phished and had a fraudulent purchase made using his PayPal account\n\nWhen I immediately reported the fraud to PayPal and tried to deal with the vendor myself, you supported the vendor and condoned his fraudulent activities. You also erroneously interpreted your investigative data and believed that to be true despite alternate interpretations of that data could be made that are actually more valid and truthful.\n\nAnd now, after being a victim of fraud and fishing, I not only lost out on money, but I now have a fake product that I canâ€™t return to the vendor because the vendor has been unresponsive. This is despite him having a clearly written return policy on his fake website.\n\nCongratulations to PayPal for the horrible job you did.
