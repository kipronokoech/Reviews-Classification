I always order through PayPal especially with new suppliers for the ‘buyer protection’ they apparently offer. I don’t know what’s happened as they’ve been helpful in the past. Placed and order for nearly £300 via PayPal for tiles, the tiles didn’t arrive and the supplier would take calls or respond to my emails so I had to place the order elsewhere. I messaged PayPal on a few occasions and was told to wait 21 days, after the 21 days I messaged them again and they just told me to speak with my bank?\n\nI explained the card used through my PayPal was a debit card not a credit card, they just told me the case was closed and I couldn’t re-open it or appeal it?\n\nCan someone please tell me what on earth the point in PayPal is, and how they are still functioning as a business if they don’t actually help with ‘Buyer’ protection anymore?', 'review_date': '2020-07-05', 'review_time': '17:39:55', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
