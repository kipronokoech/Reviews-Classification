Ended up asking the customer to cancel the payment to see she had actually sent it and I got an email notifying the cancel. So eventually I had to set up a business account and then discovered that you have to completely verify the account, as in have photo ID and my bank statement. Due to this taking time and me being busy in general, I haven't managed to get the money of the girl and would have avoided all this hassle if it was made clear that to receive payments the account must be fully verified. Luckily it was just a skirt and not an valuable item like a mobile phone (so if you are planning to sell try low risk items first) I then tried to transfer money to my bank account and three days later it was still pending- found out that apparently I hadn't verified my bank account which I am sure I did as I have a code on my bank statement for it. It has transferred now but all in all if you wish to use paypal be aware that there is a lot of verifying involved and not clear instructions on how to- Also be cautious about selling stuff as people can very easily cancel payments", 'review_date': '2017-06-25', 'review_time': '18:28:51', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
