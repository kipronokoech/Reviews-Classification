What a waste of time. So AirBnB (I'll review them too in just a moment) cancel my booking and somebody else immediately jumps in and books it.

It provides ZERO customer service and operates unethically.\n\nMy PayPal account was created in USA in 2013. I used several times and left it idle for years until 2 weeks ago to sign in. I have noticed that the country name on the primary address under my PayPal account has been changed to Emirates, and my cell# never gets their texts on codes as it has an incorrect country code 971 in front of it... It appears to be PayPal IT error when doing system upgrades.\n\nI have reached out to PayPal customer support multiple times and hours of calls to seek for help to fix the error caused by their IT in their system. HORRENDOUS experience! Their CSRs have no knowledge to handle such situation except for reading me a script---"no access to fix and I have to close the account and open the new one". Two of CSRs with strong offshore accents in their international department even accused me of picking the wrong country when signing up at the first place. All CSRs I talked to were kicking me around from domestic department to security department to international department, and so on. They ignore the root cause on their end, but simply asked me to close the account and open a new one, then to transfer my money from the old to the new. I was told it is free for such a transfer.\n\nAfter many calls and tons of hours spent, helpless and hopeless, it left me no choice but to create another account to do the transfer. HORRIBLE process! I got charged for receiving the money in the new account, plus the money is on hold and unavailable until Mar. 7th. When the fund is available and to be transferred to my bank, there will be another 3% charge imposed by PayPal. It feels like I am SCAMMED by PayPal.\n\nPayPal itself is a SCAMMER due to its unethical practices. Its IT error during upgrades is paid by its customers: 1, can be too costly to fix this non-configurate data on their end. So, it is the easiest way and no cost to PayPal if telling customers to close accounts and open new ones; 2, In so doing, PayPal can make extra money by charging those fees; 3, It will appear an increase in sales, i.e., numbers of new accounts open, on PayPal\'s financial reports presented to their investors.\n\nIn addition, it is hard to believe that a company like PayPal 100% replying on internet to operate has no HUMAN chat online or e-mail to reach them. PayPal only has robot assistant who is useless and struggling to provide non-sense answers to the questions asked.\n\nI am hoping my incomplete transfer will go smoothly after Mar. 7th. Then, I will close both of my PayPal accounts and no longer use them. I also hope my review will be helpful to other users or potential customers.', 'review_date': '2023-02-15', 'review_time': '22:38:23', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
