Sold an item on eBay to a buyer that claimed the set was incomplete, despite I have proof the weight on the receipt shows that she was lying. Anyway I provided a label so she could return the item for a refund. She refused to open the case with eBay to open it with Paypal. Guess what? Paypal let her keep the item and the money. Lucky me, I was protected by Ebay selling protection otherwise if it was for Paypal I would have lost the item and the money. I can't understand why the online returns legal dispositions were totally ignored by Paypal, violating my legal rights. Buyers are not entitled to keep the items and the money when the seller has already paid and ptovided a return label. Is this kind of attitude that makes so many online sellers stop trading due to the increasing number of online shoplifters that get away with it. Shame on you Paypal for enabling this lowlife buyers stealing online.", 'review_date': '2022-05-22', 'review_time': '00:13:48', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
