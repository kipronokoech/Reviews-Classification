PayPal may find an erroneous excuse to permanently close your account then hold your money for half a year (no doubt generating interest for them). I have many friends who have been treated this way and reading around online, this is a common occurrence.

I found a website selling cute stuff online and they had a sale (or that\'s what I thought). I ordered some items and my total was about $335. I used Paypal of course. They started to send me the stuff in different packages. Horrible quality fabric (discolored fabric on two), cheap replica of the pictures they used on their site and the sizing was from hell. I\'m a size small and some of them wouldn\'t go higher than my knees. the body suite was made in the kids size and some of them had different measurement between right and left sides. On top of that, they didn\'t send me two of the items saying they are out of stock but they didn\'t refund me for those two. I opened a claim with Paypal explaining everything. I\'ve been following up with them for the past two months and NOTHING. they keep repeating themselves like a recorded voice on a machine. they are asking me to return everything in order to receive my money back. Guess what? the site managed to not show that they are not USA based and they are located in Hong Kong. my return label will cost me over $130 dollar and they won\'t pay for it. they know I won\'t spend that much and they are refusing to provide me with a return prepaid lable since they know they stuff are garbage. I sent Paypal picture of my estimated shipping cost and pictures of the items and they keep repeating themselves " you have to return everything to get your money back" why would I want to spend that much money on top of what I paid already to send garbage back and I\'m not even sure if they will refund me. I asked to at least get a refund on the two items I didn\'t receive and they say it\'s either all or nothing???????? WHAT???????? they won\'t even follow up on what I paid for and didn\'t get. I was soooooooooo upset and when I talked to few people about them, they all confirmed that Paypal customer service is NOT what it used to be and they don\'t care for their customers protection anymore.

She spent the whole of two minutes droning on about mostly unrelated things and how she was just going to send an email, then when she finally shut up a moment for me to get a chance to ask about the problem I was having, she completely ignored me, said thank you for calling and ended the call. So after a twenty minute wait, was on the phone for three minutes max, didn't get a chance to explain anything and was left none the wiser to the issue of my payment and only more frustrated by the end.

Recently (10/8/2017) I received an email from PayPal support that one of my newly added listings is violating "PayPal\'s Acceptable Use Policy" and that my account has been permanently limited without an option of appeal. In addition to that, under my PayPal account, they have posted and immediately closed a case where they stated:\n\n"Oct 8, 2017: When you signed up for your PayPal account, you agreed to our user Agreement and Acceptable Use Policy. Because some of your recent transactions violated this policy, we\'ve had to permanently limit your account.\n\nPlease remove any references to PayPal from your website\n\nyou\'ll be able to withdraw any money in your account 180 days after your last transaction. We\'ll email you when it\'s ready to be withdrawn\n\n(Your case ID for this reason is PP-006-227-902-783"\n\nIn addition to that, PayPal stated:\n\n"\n\nUnder the PayPal Acceptable Use Policy, PayPal may not be used to send or\nreceive payments for items that infringe or violate any copyright,\ntrademark, right of publicity or privacy, or any other proprietary right\nunder the laws of any jurisdiction.\n\nThis includes transactions for any device or technological measure that\ndescrambles a scrambled work, decrypts an encrypted work or otherwise\navoids, bypasses, removes, deactivates or impairs a technological measure\nwithout the authority of the copyright owner.\n\nThis also includes transactions (WE HAD 0 TRANSACTIONS FOR THIS LISTING, 0!) for devices that allow domestic video game\nconsoles to play back-up or import versions of games, such as mod chips,\ngame enhancers, boot disks, software packages that remove protections from\nDVDs, HD DVDs and Blu-Ray DVDs and allow the user to copy the protected\ninformation into other formats, and card sharing services, which is a\nmethod of allowing multiple digital television receivers to access\nsubscription television services with only one paid subscription card.\n\n"\n\nWhile I completely disagree on PayPal\'s accusations that my company violated any of their policies, especially trademark/copyright policies, PayPal is basically claiming that my company violated their user agreements based on the Transactions which NEVER happened. The listing based on which they have limited my account never had a single sale or transaction, it was added 4-5 days before they blocked the account, which contradicts their statement.\n\nWhile I no longer want to be any part of PayPal, they are forcefully holding onto my money without allowing me to withdraw it, in the amount of: $4,746.90 (screenshot is attached "unable-to-withdraw-our-money.jpg") for at least 180 days, which is absolutely unacceptable and is a criminal action against me. This is disregarding the fact that I currently have 2 eBay stores completely on halt, because of this, which I am now considering closing down as eBay is like a PayPal in a mirror.\n\nNow, as for the listing, which they used to steal my money, based on PayPal\'s side: I am breaking some sort of their rules/trademark violations. The listing (which is already removed) contained a system, built on Raspberry Pi 3, with 2 pre-installed operating systems: Lakka and Raspbian, which are both under GNU General Public License , allows "The terms and conditions of the GPL must be made available to anybody receiving a copy of the work that has a GPL applied to it ("the licensee"). Any licensee who adheres to the terms and conditions is given permission to modify the work, as well as to copy and redistribute the work or any derivative version.". The unit is enclosed within a similar to classic NES (Nintendo Entertainment System) casing, which is freely sold on eBay and everywhere else, without any NES labels and such. In addition, several peripherals are included with the system, which are simply purchased and re-sold.\n\nNow, if PayPal would let me know that such listing does not comply with their policy - I would happily remove the listing and go on, however, with PayPal completely locking down my account and basically stealing my money - I want nothing to do with such a horrible and criminal company and withdraw my money immediately!\n\n\nI tried calling PayPal couple of times, which usually ends with extensively long hold times/call rops and when i finally able able to talk to someone - they have no information to provide or anything they could help with the matter. The only thing they would suggest is to email aup at paypal and that they will create a ticket in "that" department. So far I have not heard nothing, am very concerned about MY money!\n\nIn addition to that, it is a shame, that this so called "company" is getting away with ripping so many people off. Therefore, I am asking for any help possible to push on PayPal to stop practicing such criminal activities and give their customer\'s money back!\n\nAleksandr Kamenev', 'review_date': '2017-10-11', 'review_time': '00:31:27', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
