However what I received were defective, shoddy and unfinished items so I opened a dispute with Paypal. Paypal then put me through several weeks of jumping through hoops - having to send numerous emails providing repeated details of the items concerned - reference numbers, prices, photos of the defective clothing, details of communications with the retailers - who turned out to be scammers based in China! All of which was extremely time consuming but I persevered. I then was advised by a Paypal agent that I would be refunded upon returning the items to China by tracked mail - despite sending them detailed photos of the defective items! However I complied which incurred a cost of £20 tracked mailing costs and duly provided Paypal with tracking numbers and yet more photos to prove postage.\n\nHowever some six weeks later and not having received any further communication from Paypal, I was therefore quite shocked to see, while checking my dispute online, to see that Paypal had closed the dispute and found in favour of both scammers - after all my efforts to comply with their demands which proved to be a complete waste of time. This meant that I was now even more out of pocket from additional postage costs and without any of the clothing items (two the five sweaters had been acceptable)! Their shady practices is a reflection on who they feel is of more monetary gain. Paypal have proved that their ethics and work practices are in line with fraudsters and scammers and genuine customers will not be treated fairly.\n\nI have had a Paypal account for many years which I used quite regularly and am shocked that Paypal could deceive and lie to account holders in such a way.\n\nSince this very stressful experience I now avoid using Paypal when making transactions - one blessing is that Ebay are now offering alternative payment methods.
