Now I have taken this case to Action Fraud and the Police in the hope of getting this fraudster and paypal done. If you sell stuff using PayPal be very careful as PayPal support fraudsters and let them carry on robbing people. The person who robbed me is still messaging people on shpock to buy phones.
