When you get a message through your PayPal account they don't like a reply from you about anything regarding it. I wish that I had never set up this account but it was because of a online site that I bought from and some disgusting person who uses this Paypal for there way of things. It's the most unbearable thing that I've ever been part of, ebay wasn't like this at least they did the right thing and got rid of Paypal. I mean if it's so good then where is the reassurance from people who have been using it for years. I just want rid of the account asap because I'm not using anything like this. I don't think people should be signing up to something where all they are bothered about is all your personal details but not anything in the way of being there for you as in protection etc regarding your details. It's not asking for much to be bloody reassured by a human being that you are going to be safe using this before you go any further. I don't see the point in paying this way for goods I don't believe it's safe to use but other people might. Why can't the people who answer the call just tell you their name and some employee reassurance.
