They are asking for proof of delivery in order to receive money sooner. I check all boxes to show I didn’t ship a product but providing a service. I’m trying to get a phone number to talk to customer service but can’t get out of the computer communication. Last note said once client responds to email verification money will be released, but client has not received verification email. We both are trying to get money released so I can start his job.
