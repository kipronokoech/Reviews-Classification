If you own a small business I would recommend to stay as far away from PayPal as you possibly can. They have been holding our money for over 2 months - constantly requesting proof of this, proof of that - which we have constantly provided but they still keep our money. We now do not have any cash flow as all our money is tight up with PayPal - we are thus unable to run our business. We have reported them to the AFCA and will take this matter further. I do not understand how this company is still operating.', 'review_date': '2021-10-07', 'review_time': '06:55:40', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
