The seller contacted them back immediately even though they ignored my emails. They finally provided tracking information that I had trouble utilizing. The period for missing items is 20 days, PayPal gave them 40 days. On May 1, I finally got my package only to find it was an off-brand of what I ordered. I was lied to and scammed. There is no way what I ordered was worth $45.80. What I received was not what was described in the photos or description of the product. I first contacted the seller and then I contacted PayPal. PayPal answered first, asking me for information about the situation and changing my dispute from not arrived to significantly not as described. The seller then also asked for information about the package. They tried to get me to deal with a partial refund and I keep the package. They first offered me 10% of what I originally paid, which is like $5, then they went up to 30% and said that was the highest they were willing to go. I rejected their offer. Then PayPal messaged me stating that I was offered a refund for a dissatisfied item, like they forgot this company scammed me. In order to get the refund, I needed to return the item. I was responsible for the shipping cost. They gave me about two weeks, but never gave me an address. I contacted the seller for an address; they ignored me. I contacted PayPal; it took them almost a whole week. They finally gave me an address and I had a week to send the package back. I had to send it back to Hong Kong. The lowest price I could get was $70. I tried to get into contact with PayPal but their site was experiencing issues (note that I was only able to contact PayPal through a messaging app on their site because they cancelled their phone lines due to the virus). On June 7, they sent me an email denying my case. I tried speaking with a representative to tell them my issue. After about 9 hours, they contacted me back explaining that there was nothing that could be done. I missed the deadline, they cancelled the case, and they could no longer reopen the case due to their polices. The seller's name is SHENZHEN SOWEWAY INTERNATIONAL LOGISTICS CO.,LIMITED.
