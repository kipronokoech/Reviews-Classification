It was in relation to a returned item that I never received credit for. Their correspondence was automated, obvious that they were not reading my responses. The seller apparently knew that all that would be asked was "what is the shipping tracking number". I provided the FedEx tracking number with proof of delivery, along with the sellers email stating where to send the return. Then the seller told PayPal that the return address was in Australia. I provided all information to PayPal, but they never read anything except the tracking number. They sided with the seller, stating inaccurate tracking number....having never read anything, or the documents that I provided.', 'review_date': '2022-09-23', 'review_time': '23:01:49', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
