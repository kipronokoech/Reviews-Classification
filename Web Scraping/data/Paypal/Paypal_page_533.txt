They started taking with me then said they would transfer me to someone and never did. So I tried again to only get the worst service ever the lady was rude and told me there was nothing they could do. I don’t believe that for one second, then she just flat out ignored me so I just took my loss before I got so mad I’d regret what would come out of my mouth. I took the high road when I never should have had to but I guess that’s what you get when working with a shady ass company like PayPal and where I ordered from.
