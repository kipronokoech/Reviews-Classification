A friend just transferred a large-ish sum of money to me. I get an email from PayPal saying they\'ve held 85% of the funds for this "purchase" until I ship the "item" to the "customer", and they\'ve kept $347.00 US as a "service fee". When I called PayPal, their customer service supervisor, Mark, was incredibly rude to me. He basically told me I\'m out the $347, they can\'t tell me when my account was changed to business account, and he was incredibly rude about it. So this account I\'ve had for 22 years is suddenly a business account, but they can\'t tell me how. They can\'t FIX the problem. They can\'t give me the $347 back. On top of that, they\'re holding 85% of the funds for TWENTY-ONE DAYS, and the other 15% of the funds, they said they\'d release. So I went online to transfer the funds to the VERIFIED BANK ON THE ACCOUNT which has been verified for OVER A DECADE, and I was required to submit a photo of my ID, and a current photo of myself, before they\'d release. So I did that, and they told me they can\'t release the funds because they can\'t verify it\'s me. WHAT??? Look, I don\'t know how many random strangers want to put money INTO my bank account, but should this really be an issue? It\'s a PayPal account TIED TO a specific bank account, and so what does it matter WHO is putting the funds into the account, as long as the funds are going into the bank account tied to the PayPal account. Seriously, people nowadays seem to have problems with logic. And all of this frustration has only cost me the small (lol) sum of $347.', 'review_date': '2023-06-04', 'review_time': '20:50:15', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

On the 15th of May, I fell victim to a deceptive scheme by the company 123helpme.com. Despite signing up for a £7 seven-day trial, they sneakily charged me a staggering £119.40 for an entire year. Outraged by this fraudulent activity, I immediately canceled my subscription and sought a refund from the company.\n\nUpon reaching out to PayPal, I diligently followed all the necessary procedures and provided substantial evidence to support my claim. However, to my utter dismay, the back office staff closed my case, siding with the fraudsters, without conducting a proper investigation. It became apparent that their laziness and lack of commitment led to a negligent resolution in favor of the fraudulent company.\n\nThis unprofessional conduct not only reflects poorly on PayPal as a trusted platform but also leaves customers vulnerable to corporate fraud schemes. The fact that 123helpme.com operates under the guise of a legitimate company, "Barnes and Noble," only adds insult to injury. PayPal\'s failure to take appropriate action against these wrongdoers not only enables their fraudulent practices but also demonstrates a lack of accountability on their part.\n\nI am deeply disappointed by the lack of diligence, care, and attention to detail exhibited by PayPal\'s staff members in handling my dispute. As a customer who relies on PayPal for secure transactions, I expected better service and support. It is disheartening to see a company of PayPal\'s stature failing to address the concerns of its customers in an efficient and satisfactory manner.\n\nI strongly urge PayPal to reevaluate its dispute resolution procedures and ensure that cases are thoroughly investigated, giving due consideration to the evidence provided by affected customers.\nI hope my review serves as a wake-up call for PayPal to prioritize the well-being and trust of its customers, taking proactive steps to prevent such instances of mishandled disputes in the future.', 'review_date': '2023-06-03', 'review_time': '17:50:23', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
