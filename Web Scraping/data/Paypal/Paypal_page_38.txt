Recently, I legally changed my name and requested to update it on my PayPal account. Unfortunately, I was met with disappointment as PayPal informed me that I could no longer use their services because I had created the account before I turned 18. This experience has left me frustrated and disappointed with PayPal. I reached out to their customer service, but it seemed like there was no way to resolve the issue or delete my account information.\n\nI strongly advise against using PayPal due to their inflexibility and lack of understanding in such situations. They seem to categorize anyone who created an account before they turned 18 as a potential scammer, which is unfair and unjust. Despite growing older and providing all the necessary legal documentation, they still treated me as if I were underage. This attitude is not only irrelevant but also discriminatory.\n\nI wish PayPal had a better system in place to handle cases like mine, where people have genuinely changed and improved over the years. Their refusal to work with me has left me feeling frustrated and helpless. Creating a new account is not a practical solution, as it would mean starting from scratch on multiple platforms.\n\nOverall, I hope PayPal reevaluates their policies and becomes more understanding and accommodating to their users' needs. Until then, I cannot recommend PayPal as a reliable payment option.", 'review_date': '2023-07-24', 'review_time': '14:02:52', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
