Lately in a large part because of their advertising campaign and their claim that they offer buyers protection I tried to pay with Paypal whenever possible even though some sites charge a premium for using Paypal. I thought it is OK for the extra peace of mind. However the peace of mind is really wishful thinking.\nThe first time I had a problem I realised that “Buyer Protection” does not really exist. At least not from Paypal.\nI purchased some items from ebuyer (another huge mistake) who use Yodel for deliveries, and Yodel are worse than both Paypal and ebuyer put together.\nYodel attempted delivery once and when I found the card I contacted them through their web site to arrange another delivery two days later when I could arrange to be at home. Yodel ignored my arrangement and delivered next day to an unknown address and obtained a signature from someone NOT myself or a member of our household.\nWhen nothing arrived on the day I expected delivery I looked at the Yodel web site and saw that they claim the order was delivered. I immediately contacted Yodel and ebuyer and was given the run around for a week. I was not worried I thought I have buyer protection from Paypal. How fullish.\nAfter a week of wasted time and many telephone calls to premium numbers (Yodel) and ebuyer I finally gave up and turned to Paypal to fix the problem. They took almost a month and the final answer they gave me was that the seller can prove they sent the order and that it was sent to my address they cannot give a refund even if the order was never delivered to me. They know that someone other than myself signed for the parcel someone that is not a member of my household but that does not matter. Buyer protection? Do not believe a word of it.\nIn conclusion. If you want to buy something on-line DO NOT BUY IT FROM EBUYER. IF YOUR SUPPLIER USES YODEL DO NOT BUY FROM THEM AND REMEMBER PAYPAL BUYER PROTECTION IS NON EXISTENT.', 'review_date': '2014-12-17', 'review_time': '19:19:34', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

Having provided my name and address, phone number and credit card details, and spent ages going through various layers of "security" checks, their automatic system eventually generated a page of data which I was asked to check and verify as correct. Which is where it all went horribly wrong...\n\nThe page of data that PayPal\'s system created included the last few digits of my credit card account number, and the last two digits of that number were incorrect. This was interesting, because although the application process had asked for my credit card number, I don\'t recall it asking for the account number, and so the system seemed to have either sourced the number from elsewhere, or had generated the number itself. As the number was clearly incorrect I immediately tried to rectify the error, but despite my trying various routes for about 30 minutes, the system refused to let me change it. I eventually decided that the only way round the problem was to abort the application and try again. So I cancelled the account and everything to do with it, and started from scratch. This time, PayPal refused the application on the grounds that my credit card number was already linked to another account. What account? There certainly isn\'t - and never has been - any other PayPal account associated with my name or credit card. Presumably the refusal was to do with the application I had refused to complete, and had cancelled as a last resort because Paypal\'s system had glitched and thrown up incorrect credit card details.\n\nTo make matters worse, when you open a PayPal account the system automatically verifies your bank account\'s existence by doing a small "trial" transaction. As this trial transaction was apparently executed but hasn\'t shown up on my bank account\'s transaction sheet, I\'ve got to assume that somebody else - presumably the unfortunate person with the incorrect account number - has had their account visited by PayPal without any authorisation. That\'s a bit of a worry because somewhere en route the erroneous transaction - albeit a tiny one - will have my name attached to it, and I\'m very unhappy about that.\n\nI needed the Paypal account in order to buy things on Ebay - using an old Ebay account which I\'ve had lying dormant for a few years - but as an Ebay account is pretty useless these days without PayPal, I\'ve reluctantly closed the Ebay account.\n\nSo, all in all, a complete and utter shambles. The PayPal account application process turned out to be an absolute farce - generating errors and with no identifiable way of correcting them. In this connection, two emails intended to reach PayPal\'s singularly unhelpful "help" service - using an emergency link provided by PayPal in an earlier email - were almost impossible to send. The link didn\'t work, the process seemed to be deliberately obstructive, and when I finally found another way of emailing PayPal and making them aware of the problem, I was by no means sure if anybody actually received the emails.\n\nIn fairness, plenty of people seem to use PayPal, apparently without difficulty, so perhaps I was just very unlucky to have encountered a system generated error and associated insurmountable difficulties during the sign up procedure. But I did, and as a result I\'m deeply unimpressed and in the future shall avoid having anything to do with PayPal.', 'review_date': '2014-11-20', 'review_time': '01:18:46', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
