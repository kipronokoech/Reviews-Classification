Company at first not allowing returns for ‘hygiene’ then would allow but gave 3-4 different addresses all fake. Despite some in Europe documenting from postal service in Estonia is false and would not take returns as well as pics of actual returns they refunded some but not all. They then wanted response from USPS and the Estonia post on letterhead which they refused. The Canadian Royal Mountain Police issued that was fake company and also told to not return as fake and due to safety issues that lithium batteries in the post would be while roaming around the world. Hundreds of posts and sent all this documentation and Paypal still not refunding a lot of people. Some have been able to get their bank to refund when Paypal still refused to do as they promised to return all funds if merchandise not as advertised. But then scam they want you to pay the shipping but they may perhaps repay you 30.00.. Postage for this scam will be over 150.00 and for address that is fake. So post returns and you have no recourse. I think Paypal has gotten too big to give service. For sure there are some causes that I must use them.. from now on will use my bank credit card so I an at least talk to customer service that will be more responsive to the obvious.\n\nSome have had luck with Trustpilot and I have bookmarked this site as amazing international service.
