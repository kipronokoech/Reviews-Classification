I just want to let everyone know about a loophole that buyers are taking advantage of. I bought an item from a uk shop that was nothing like the item that was described. I opened a dispute and they quickly accepted a refund as they were in the wrong. The loophole is this, Paypal's policy is that the buyer has to pay for return shipping, even if you get scammed you still have to pay return shipping, which is bs, it shouldn't cost you a penny if a seller has not been honest. Then the seller tells me that the return address is in America and the shipping cost for the heavy bulky items I need to return is close to ¬£150, they know that most people will not bother to return the item and you can't blame them. Paypal did offer me ¬£50 as a goodwill gesture as I've been a loyal customer for 16 years and also let me know about their free return scheme that you can sign up for. The return scheme will pay for return shipping but only up to $30 max even with the max and the ¬£50 goodwill, it still doesn't come close to covering the costs. I have no choice but to cancel my account. I could sell you a phone for ¬£100, send you a banana, tell you to ship it to New Zealand and which ever way you look at it, you are going to lose money.", 'review_date': '2021-03-02', 'review_time': '20:54:20', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
