All of it was correct. However days later Dec. 13 I received another email from Paypal saying that the bank refused to make the payment and so they used my back up bank and card. THEY somehow switched things around AND they then told me in the email that they DELETED my other bank account and card!!!! I said What the !!! That bank account ( the one they deleted) and card is still active I just don't use it much. I double checked everything and yes I used the correct bank account and card when I made the payment. EVERYTHING was correct And Paypal confirmed this in the original payment conformation email. So then how did everything get all screwed up? How THEY decided to change the payment method and switch to my other account and then LIE to me and say that I used the wrong bank account and card (when I still have their original email proving otherwise) and how they proceeded to tell me that the bank refused to pay it. I checked the other account and there were NO transactions. PERIOD. They LIED and they DELETED my other bank account and card for no reason.
