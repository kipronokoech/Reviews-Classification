In addition, their customer service was inconsistent and misleading in communication, and ultimately unable to help.\n\nI got in touch with them because, having been granted around £2000 in PayPal Credit, the option to use Credit was withdrawn at checkout on eBay after I had won an auction. At that point, backing out of payment can go on your record as an eBayer. So I went ahead with the purchase, and called PayPal to ask why the Credit option had been denied, and to ask for the payment to be moved to Credit.\n\nThe customer service advisor told me Credit had not been an option at checkout because I had selected 'pay after delivery.' I know this to be incorrect. Before and since, I have paid with PayPal Credit while 'pay after delivery' was selected.\n\nIn future communications over email, customer service advisors either misunderstood or deliberately misled me over this point, refusing to accept they had given inaccurate information.\n\nThe email back-and-forth was frustrating; I frequently had to repeat information from earlier messages to get my point across. In the end the payment could not be transferred to Credit, but my negative review is as much for the customer-service experience as for the policy of suddenly withdrawing Credit without the option to transfer later.\n\nA further discussion on the phone resulted in their cutting the connection - not for the first time. In fact, I’d already asked that if the connection cut out, they call me back. They failed to do that, and when I emailed explaining what happened, they played ignorant and asked me to once again go over every issue I’d been encountering. After hours of frustration and corporate incompetence, I ended up on TrustPilot.", 'review_date': '2018-03-06', 'review_time': '12:42:46', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

Receipts of items that have never been sold as ive never used it and a bunch of sensitive identification which there is no way im sending any of it to some 2 bit minimum wage freak who works there.

I feel sorry for anyone hoping to make a few quid as youve no chance if using this lot!

I wish id bothered to look on here and their facebook page all of which are inundated with complaints of theft. Limited accounts. Lying customer service (which ive experienced 1st hand myself) and every fraudulent activity you can think of. The best lie was when they told me they were a bank. Ive held a bank account since i was a child and never had one lock me out of it or steal funds from it or ask that i provide business invoices or receipts when making a deposit!
