I\'ve been an user for 3 years, went good for the first 2 years, then when I had my first problem with getting refund from a seller, Paypal ignored my 10 times requests to get help on the process, because it was using the Ebay Guarantee so not the usual way. Also by not having direct international competitors, they are with their monopoly abusing tax charges, for example if you as a seller on Ebay refunds a buyer for any reason, you get penalized as the initial Paypal\'s tax fee isn\'t included in the refund, so you have to pay on top of the refunded amount. Another example of abuse from them is the terrible currency conversion rate, seriously the same level as scammers in the street of any major cities around the world. And this poor rate is not justified, Revolut for example proves it. Seriously this is the perfect example of "What happens when a company has the monopoly". The others cashless ways are ridiculous & not even comparable to this.
