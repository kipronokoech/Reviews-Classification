Previous, had a bad time and difficulty dealing with how PayPal was delaying and hindering my access to my money. Since that horrific experience, things have improved. Transfers went more smooth, had no difficulty with transactions, although limited by a set weekly transfer amount. Of 3k. So since I could not transfer my money out fast enough, I simply used that account for all expenses.\nI like crypto. Especially Bitcoin, and Ethereum. They had a little crypto exchange. It was convenient, easy to use. Exposes this new technology to people that otherwise don't know anything about it. Which is good. More people need to use what crypto has to offer. Investing is a start. Paypal made it pretty simple! So, my previous outrage and frustration with PayPal has subsided.. And everything has been handled smoothly since.. Hint:: Make sure all info is totally current and verified. PayPal security gets nervous handling larger amounts of money. For example, $10k. Trying to transfer anything over $3k a week typically won't happen. They do tend to overkill with their security demands and verification of verifications that have been verified, should be enough.", 'review_date': '2021-09-29', 'review_time': '19:11:21', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

What a complete waste of time and effort. When someone finally responded on chat they repeated the same stupid thing over and over again. This took over (3+) hours of my time. Their response was - they couldn't close my account and didn't know why they couldn't. Their answer to the problem was for me to try again. Pathetic and very unprofessional call center.
