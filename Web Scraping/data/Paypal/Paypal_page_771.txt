This was done on the 21st of  December.\n\n\nAfter this i waited until the 31st when i got a email saying the dispute was closed in the sellers favour.\n\n\nThis made no sense to me so i looked on paypal to see the tracking information was there but the item was delivered to BRISTOL. Whereas i live in DAGENHAM 5 HOURS AWAYYYY.\n\n\nSo of course i called paypal up that day thinking it was a simple mistake and i should recieve my money back, to whichi spoke to a woman and she told me my refund should be sorted within 48 hours.\n\n\n2 days later i then called back as i still revieved no email or money in my account only to find the dispute had been closed again in the sellers favour.\n\nThe woman i spoke to then told me the case would be reviewed she would put a note against the account saying to check the distance and the money sent within 48 hours again to which i said thank you and put the phone down\n\n\nYet again 2 days later i still recieved no refund or email and i called again only to find for a THIRD time the case was closed in the sellers favour. I then proceeded to call again and spoke to a woman called Bea, her id was 1317.she told me the case would be reviewed again and she would put a note against the case saying the distance and that she would vouch for me to which i then again said thank you and hung up\n\n\nI then proceeded to call the next day to make sure that they was actually reading the case rather than just automatically closing it which i assume they must have been doing, i then spoke to a woman called brian who told me it is under review\n\n\nToday (07/01/19) i got an email saying that i got my refund and it would be back within 30 days BUT i also got an additional email saying my account was limited for violating terms and agreements  and i would not be able to use my paypal for 180days\n\n\nI tried calling paypal, when i was put through to a woman called nicole.\n\nShe was very condesending and extermely unhelpful. I asked her why i was blockedand she told me i was blocked for violating the terms. When i asked her howdid i violate the terms she said when i sold a ring a few days back. She then asked me where do i get the items and do i have reciepts which i do and she told me im not allowed to sell jewellery. I said how comes i didnt recieveany warnings or advances and i asked her whether i could stop selling jewellery and unlock my account. She then said ermm let me think pit me on hold for 2 minutes and said no thanks i dont want to i then asked for her name and id and she said nicole and promptly hung up.\n\n\nNot only did they not give me a warning or even a reason why i am being blocked but they gave no fair chance to unblock my account\n\n\nI then asked my mother for advice and she found quite a few similar cases wheee people ask for a refund on an item for a large amount of moneg and get limited or blocked for no reason at all\n\n\nI am writing to you because i believe this is a serious issue if a company that literally works as a bank account can block and hold your money with no reason or warning', 'review_date': '2019-01-07', 'review_time': '14:40:36', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

They are limiting accounts now on mass without warning nor explanation. They must be holding many millions in customer funds which surely cannot be legal. To do this PayPal must be protected by some very high power in their industry, or governments etc... (In my opinion), I am pretty sure that PayPal are illegally holding our money and as a result are growing much richer at our expense.\n\nPayPal allow websites to use their services then penalise the website users when they do business with these sites. (Usually small businesses) This is insane business practice. Surly the agenda here on PayPal’s part is to allow a company to use their service even though the company do not comply with their terms (which are plentiful and contradictory). That to me means PayPal are knowingly allowing transactions to take place in order to then hold funds from said transactions. They then limit all account involved but usually not before a significant amount of money becomes involved. Crazy!!\n\nPayPal are responsible for letting website owners establish a business using their services. Then grow that business to a point where the website owners and customers of the site rely on the income from that website. Then without warning or explanation PayPal pull their usual account limitation act on all involved parties. Surely PayPal should never have allowed a business to get started with their service that doesn’t comply with their policies. Or should there be a policy change notify any business owners and customers of the specific terms that would need to be changed by the business in order to continue using PayPal.\n\nPayPal play Judge, Jury and executioner with their customers when in their policy section 1.1 of “Our Relationship with you” they state: (PayPal is only a Payment Service Provider. PayPal helps you make payments to and accept payments from third parties. PayPal is an independent contractor for all purposes, except that PayPal acts as your agent only with respect to the custody of your funds. PayPal does not have control of or liability for the products or services that are paid for with our Service. We do not guarantee the identity of any User or ensure that a buyer or a seller will complete a transaction).\n\nIt would seem PayPal have more control than they are claiming to have above. In the event of any limitation PayPal should be dealing with these cases on an individual basis and sorting them out in real time. Instead they place 180 day or longer limitation on their customer’s accounts and hold any funds. Then ignore the customer. Charge back amounts could be held and anything over and above released. Or in any event of suspected illegal activity funds held with all parties notified of the specifics and the relevant government authorities involved.\n\nWho do PayPal have to answer to? It would seem they make up their own laws and the customers are the ones who suffer. The larger they grow the more they do as they like at our expense. All of the folks here on trust pilot who are giving them a good score have yet to see the bad side of PayPal. I hope this won’t be the case but sadly, sooner or later it probably will.\n\nWe need an alternative to PayPal to break the monopoly and shake them up. A threat to their business will be the only way they will change their ways. Or maybe proper regulation from governments removing the power from PayPal. As you look around the internet there are quite a few new processors popping up now. They have a long way to go to challenge PayPal for the top spot, if they are ever allowed to do so. Fingers crossed that in the future other processors will arrive on the net that do the job fairly morally and legally correct.

I then called ebay and asked for some advice... ebay stated if buyer and seller can MUTUALLY agree it’s fine to cancel sale and put item back on auction...\n\nI said I don’t mutually agree and therefore will dispatch item to buyer. Case closed. Being it the bank holiday period of 31/12/18- 01/01/19. I was going to dispatch the item on the 02/01/2019. Buyer was fully aware, as he made payment on 30/12/18.
