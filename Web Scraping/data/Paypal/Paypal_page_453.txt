I sold on Ebay an item I purchased 5 years ago. Never sold anything on Ebay, it was my first time. After the bidding was closed, I went to PayPal to confirm the funds have been received. But my account is frozen.\nPayPal thinks that everyone that sells on Ebay is a business. I am not. I sold a personal item. I mean, I get it, they have to hold the funds in escrow till you fulfill your obligation as a seller. That\'s fine. But not what they are requiring to "resolve" the issue.\nSo; I had to provide a copy of the listing. A copy of my ID. They asked me for a receipt for the item I sold, but that has to be less than six months old. Hello!!!! I had the item for five years. Still looking for the receipt. And they also want proof of mailing the item. Well if I am being blackmailed into shipping the item without actually having a guarantee about being paid.... I call that a vicious circle. OF COURSE I am going to ship the item, that goes without saying.\nI do not trust PayPal with my money. I don\'t know why Ebay is working with them so they must be in cahoots together.\nI understand, there are millions of scam artists out there. But PayPal assumes everyone is a criminal. I mean, they have my bank account, for the love of Pete. But not for long.
