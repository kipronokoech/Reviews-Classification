They had a good buyer protection policy that was clearly articulated, and it was reasonably easy to contact them when things go wrong.\n\nNot so any more. I have had several issues with them recently, but at the heart of all of those is the utter impossibility of communicating with them in any sensible grownup manner. Like many online platforms they have started using an automated chat-bot, which is almost always completely unable to resolve your issue and drives you up the wall by sending you around in circles. And if you aren\'t able to resolve your issue with the chat-bot easily it resorts to repeatedly just saying "thank you" - over and over, ignoring your further attempts to activate its issue recognition software.\n\nApart from the diabolical and completely pointless and time-wasting chat-bot, there is no way to send them a message or an email. So, if you are unlucky enough to have to work for a living (as most of us do) and do a job that doesn\'t allow you to spend an hour on the phone during the day trying to resolve a Paypal issue (as many of us do), and don\'t get home until late evening due to a commute or busy work period - you are stuffed.\n\nWhen you do finally get to speak to a human you are already at the end of your tether.\n\nI wish I could say that Paypal is the only place that this has happened, but it seems to be commonplace these days and I am guessing that it\'s due to a combination of staff shortages, greed and incompetence.\n\nDear Paypal - most of your customer\'s work for a living, so try making yourself available at a time that they are. And if you can\'t deliver then don\'t offer the service. If you don\'t have the staff then cut something back until you reach a level of business where you are able to provide an adequate customer service (as every small business is having to do right now – only the greedy incompetent multi-nationals are arrogant enough to think that they don’t need to do this too). It\'s not rocket science. This is not acceptable. I don\'t expect you to work 24/7, but I do expect to be able to communicate with you.', 'review_date': '2022-09-14', 'review_time': '22:21:26', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
