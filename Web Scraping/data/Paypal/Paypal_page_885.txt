Now that my rating is up a bit I get the funds straight away but my problems with PayPal are far from that.\n\nI had £1311.50 gambled away on a gambling site. That much went via PayPal and another £100 straight from my bank account. I won't bore you all with the big details but basically £70 of that money my bank was able to stop going through due to it going through as a direct debit for some reason.\n\nThis put me in negative £70 balance with them and for over a month now I've been phoning them up and emailing them saying these transactions were fraudulent but they keep saying they've investigated more than enough times to find out that they're not fraudulent. But now that department doesn't want any more to do with me, I keep getting threatening phone calls from their 'collections' department demanding I pay them this money. Even when I say they were fraudulent and I refuse to pay, I just get ignorant response back saying that they've investigated enough and I either pay them or they'll send the bailiffs around. The emails also say this.\nI've continued arguing and saying these transactions were fraudulent and even sent them the police fraud document but they're still demanding this money from me.\n\nPeople keep saying to me that they won't send bailiffs around just for £70 but from google searches it looks like they have done before now. But at the end of the day all I can do is refuse to pay them also and show them proof of documentation.\n\nI've also recently heard of over 20 people on my Facebook who have also had money stolen via their PayPal lately and they refuse to help. So a little word of advice, please don't use this horrible service because they are a joke. It's a shame really because I love buying things on eBay as well but I've had to take my business elsewhere now.\n\nEdit - April 5th 2016:\nI've just come across this in my reviews, and more happened after they were pestering me and threatening me with collection agencies. Well I actually received a letter from a collection agency demanding this money, I just put it aside and shortly after, they phoned me up. The lady from the agency was very friendly and asked if I knew about it, I explained the situation, she asked me for the crime number, I gave her it and I never heard anything after that.\nPayPal wanted verification and bank account details but I never gave my details to them so that they didn't take this money off me, in the end they closed my account down. I do have another one, with a different bank and slightly adjusted name (initials instead of my full name) because I need PayPal for eBay sales and I earn money from YouTube from a network who pay via PayPal only..\n\nI just don't really pay for things via them anymore unless it's eBay.", 'review_date': '2016-04-05', 'review_time': '19:59:26', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
