I was told I could not with an error message. I called and was told I was flagged for security purposes because I had not used PayPal before and would have to wait 72 hours to try to re-submit, but no promises that it would then be approved?? And because I did not give my SS#. Begrudgingly I gave my SS#, then also my Passport picture, and also a credit card statement. I received an email stating that my "limitations" had been lifted. Now late sending my payment that I agreed to send by contract (believing I would not have any issues since I verified before using this service) I tried again. Same error message. Thought, there is something wrong. I logged out, and back in. Same message. I gave in and gave my Debit card info just to get my VA their money. STILL, was declined. I called again, and was told now I needed to relinquish my banking account information! And we wonder why we have a security issue here in the united states!! That was the last straw for me- I closed my account, signed up to money gram, and within a few minutes without issues or having to call or give any information- I was able to send my VA their payment- GOODbye Paypal!!!', 'review_date': '2022-06-19', 'review_time': '05:52:46', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

I call rep 1. she cant go off script and cant resolve the problem. so her solution was to put me on hold permanently. second rep flat out lies. now even though it is none of their business what transpired to prompt the deposit into my account they require my transaction records. during the first call I emailed them over. the 1st rep says give them 6 hours to read 2 receipts. a five year old could accomplish that task in five minutes. I asked for a supervisor hence the endless hold. rep 2 tells me after I tell her the paperwork although none of their business has been provided. she says the lock is lifted and I can access my funds now. I said now? she said now. so off to the atm i go. total lie i cannot access my funds. call back and get rep 3. again telling her all of the details (none of their business) and tell her that the last incompetent useless person I spoke with there said my paperwork was reviewed and the account was unlocked so why can I not access my my my money. she starts to tell me that I have to provide the paperwork for the transaction. a monkey really would have been less frustrating to speak with. I ask for a supervisor again and after 50 (that's fifty) minutes I get transferred to someone identifying themselves as Dylan. I go through the details of the last 3 and a half hours with what should be his team right. he starts running the same script at me. then in an effort to condescend to me he stated well this is just a prepaid card not a real account (take note of what they think of all you paypal prepaid customers) well silly little incompetent Dylan doesn't know how many accounts I hold with paypal who in a profound lack of judgement let's this group interface with their customers but in his statement he should have been able to extrapolate, as any thinking person would that this account he looked down his ignorant nose at imposes no possible threat to paypal . the money is in the account. my money. so paypal is doing exactly what? meddling into my life? holding money that does not belong to them(some would call this stealing) for the purpose of acquiring interest (all would call this illegal), what. and is your big plan if you find your intrusion into my personal affairs isnt adequate. will you send the money to someone other than to whom it belongs, keep it? pretty sure both of those actions are illegal. I swear if you put any of these people in a human sized paper bag as you left for the day they would still be in it when you returned. do not, if you care about your money and having trust in you financial businesses, if you care about your blood pressure levels, if you care about trust and acting reasonable and in good faith, entrust a dime into the care of paypal. ebay has a close relationship with paypal so I will be hitting them up to for at the minimum poor judgement and at the maximum putting their customers at risk and through hell just to conduct simple business. by the way dylan. you do not qualify as a supervisor. I wouldnt let you supervise my shoe laces. you hung up on me. if I were your boss you would be fired. if you hold a supervisory position then the actions of the group there make more sense but are still absolutely embarrassing to your business and any business who does business with you. leaders lead. you are not a leader. finally paypal. you are outside of the scope of your business model. if a horse clip cliopped in there and crapped money into my account it is my money and none of your business what compelled him to do so. get back on your side of the net.", 'review_date': '2022-06-18', 'review_time': '23:33:56', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

I always felt safe to use it as they offer easy payment management using many different credit cards, bank accounts etc. Almost 7 years I was happy with their payment service. However, "customer service" was a different story. I bought a digital subscription from a seller who promised 6 months of subscription. The subscription was cancelled only after a few days. The seller never responded to my requests. I reported fraud to PayPal and provided the proof of purchase, item description and communications with the seller. First PayPal asked me to return the product and show the proof of shipment. It was a digital item received in email, no physical item to ship. The phony seller knew his game. There was no human interaction. PayPal refused my claim. I contacted PayPal again and explained the situation. They rejected the claim once again saying "your purchase is not protected under our user agreement". I was frustrated to see that PayPal would rather team up with the swindler to make more money. Of course, fraud sellers and PayPal would make a great team.

I logged in to my account after the 180 days passed to discover that PayPal stole my money and transferred all my balance to themselves under the false claim of nonexistent damages. There was no damage to PayPal and I believe their claims are false. Any disputes or returns were settled and all my customers were happy with their product.

I wanted them to contact beyond body (another scam company). I made a purchase through an Instagram ad, I just want to lose a couple of pounds. I did their stupid little quiz to get my personalized book with their recipes (which made me want to throw up). I know I made a big mistake pushing that purchase button. But, it seemed legit especially with all of the reviews which clearly were fake. I should have known better. But, I was deceived and the product was garbage, and not what I anticipated. The company said they would give me a partial refund because I was disappointed with their product. They charged me US funds which wasn’t made clear when I purchased the product either, I canceled the payment immediately after. I canceled the subscription and stopped automatic payments through Pay Pal. I did this all within the 72 hour window. This company that scammed me was giving me a hard time obviously. So I thought I would contact Pay Pal to demand them to give me a full refund or the partial refund that they promised me. They decided to side with them. Saying they didn’t have to give me a refund at all! They said I didn’t cancel the payment before I even paid it. What the hell is that? I purchased a product and I am demanding a refund because their website also says 100% money back guaranteed. Then in their policy it said if you are disappointed then contact us within 14 days for a partial or full refund. Then it says on another part that they don’t give refunds. So what the heck is it? What kind of return policy is that? So basically their policies are extremely contradictory. Another part of their scam. I am not the only person who had these issues so at least I don’t feel so dumb for falling for their bull. I guess upon further research (should have done that before, I know) there are so many bad reviews about this company. There is even youtube videos on it. The company promised me all of this and of course was giving me the run around. I have been in talks with them for over a week now. I am so frustrated, They just have to issue the refund to my card. Instead of Pay Pal helping me out with this, they made up this response and it makes zero sense. The money wasn’t charged automatically it was still pending on my visa for a while. They claim that I should have done it before it processed and I did. I cancelled within an hour after I realized how much I was charged and that I was deceived. The company responded within that time offering me the partial refund! I should be getting a full refund! Especially after all of this. Now they said to contact my bank… Are you kidding me? I still don’t know why this service exists. I used my visa through them. There’s literally no point. I just thought that I could use this service in case I had any fraudulent purchases. In this case I did! I was literally scammed, I thought they were to be used to protect customers, but I guess they are just as bad as these scam companies. Then when I tried to close my account with Pay Pal because I am so infuriated over this situation, they said they needed their “engineers” to fix the technical issues on their website. I want my account closed now and it says you cannot close your account and you have to contact customer service. At this point I can’t deal with them any further. I reported all of this to my bank in hopes I can get something back. I wouldn’t recommend any of these companies at all. This has been just such a waste of my time. It’s not like they took $15.00 like I thought I was paying. It said $15.00 per month also in the description of payment options. I ended up paying for a six month subscription which was around $95 US, then exchange rate cost me approximately $125 Canadian! That’s a huge difference.
