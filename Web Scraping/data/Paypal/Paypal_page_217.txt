I had never had it happen before and was nervous and scared to contact the company, LOL. I submitted the problem to PayPal though their built-in system and they got back to me and refunded the money!! I actually couldn't believe it. Huge stress reliever and a pleasant surprise. I have to say that I have just not had very bad experiences with PayPal. Sure though, a lot of things stink like their holding money thing. I have both the business app and the normal PayPal app. I found other ways to handle big chunks of money being transferred. You just...deal with it. I wanted to write a review because of the bad reviews I saw on here...guys...it's not thaaat bad. PayPal is CERTAINLY not a scam and if you treat it with the same caution and careful suspicion that we should treat all things that handle our money, it's a decent option. And, hello--what else are we going to use to do, oh, I don't know--EVERYTHING? If you are nervous about using it for the first time because you feel like you have to but then you see these bad reviews and are about to run the other direction, I would say just have courage and use good sense and you will probably be fine. They are not a scam company.
