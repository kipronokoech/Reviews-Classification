The nature of the emails were about his account which was in arrears or didn’t have the correct information or other missteps apparently on John’s part. Why was I receiving those emails? Because this clown, John Deuberry, used MY EMAIL ADDRESS to set up HIS PayPal account!\n\nI tried to contact PayPal every which way from Sunday, but all roads at PayPal lead to: “Please log into your account” in order to send a message. But I don’t have a PayPal account. And there is no way to send them a message if you can’t log into an account.\n\nSo, I called them. And I spent an hour on the phone with one of their completely incompetent employees. He kept asking me for my phone number and address and I kept telling him he didn’t need to know those things. It was his client that stole my email and he should contact this John Deuberry and get the problem solved. After more than an hour on the phone, I was assured the problem would be resolved even though I had absolutely no confidence that it would.\n\nAnd a few days later I get more emails addressed to John Deuberry at my email address. Next I emailed Dan Shulman, CEO of PayPal. I laid out the problem. I got no response what-so-ever.\n\nAfter that I wrote a snail mail letter to John Rainey, CFO of PayPal. No response.\n\nYesterday, December 7, 2021, I used Facebook Messenger to send my complaint and I actually got someone to respond to me. But he/she could not understand my problem. What the actual ****? Then another person jumped into the fray and she seemed to understand the problem. She told me to write an email using the email account John Deuberry commandeered to unsolicitedemail@____ and describe the problem in that email. Because, I dunno, I forgot to tell someone at the company what the problem is.\n\nAnd . . . oh, you’ll love this . . . moments ago I got an email addressed to John Deuberry at my email address asking him if he authorized a change to his email. OMG!!! John Deuberry has not received ONE SINGLE EMAIL from PayPal because he’s using my email address and they all come to me!!!! Helloooooooo!!!! Ugh. Ripping my hair out.\n\nStill not resolved.', 'review_date': '2021-12-08', 'review_time': '18:34:38', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
