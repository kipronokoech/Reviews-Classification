Now, however Paypal is worthless with no protection what so ever to your funds. Had two bad experiences recently:\n\n1- A seller sent an item to a wrong address, I have disputed while proving a wrong address error by seller. PayPal have denied my dispute because the item was shipped, to whome it was shipped?! and has the seller send it to the correct address?? They couldn't care less!! So didn't received my item and lost my money $180.\n\n2- Another seller sent my item, but the Item got lost in shipping. Contacted the seller and he agreed to refund me. However neither the seller could get the money to refund me, nor I could get my refund. Money is stuck with paypal for nothing. Contact PayPal, received Auto reply and never heard from them!!\n\nTheir system is now build so to make it very difficult to find your way to contact them, and once you are able to send email, you get auto reply and never hear from them again.\n\nPaypal Protection today is a big scam, I dont feel that my money is safe with them, I'm canceling my account.", 'review_date': '2020-05-15', 'review_time': '04:06:36', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
