Some months ago they close my account after 18 months of using them after I sought permission to sell within the vaping categories!\n\nNever once in the 18 months of using PayPal did I have a dispute let alone a chargeback. Didn’t touch CBD or anything even related to CBD and I kept well within the rules.\n\nSo randomly they close my account after informing me that they do not accept accounts to sell within these categories. They don’t respond when you email them they just literally send a generic reply.\n\nI mean they don’t accept within these categories however! You look at any major distributor and they are using paper not only on the distribution of wholesale side of things but also on the retail side of things.\n\nBut hey they don’t accept companies within the Vaping category any longer.\n\nI know, it had me laughing as well. If I’m honest when you actually look around at the company is that I allowed to use PayPal for vaping products they are companies that turnover millions. So I mean instead of just saying we don’t accept it they do actually need to change the terms and conditions to state you need a certain level of turnover.\n\nI think it’s in really poorly!
