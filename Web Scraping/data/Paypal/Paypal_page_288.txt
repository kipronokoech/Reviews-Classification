They seem to arbitrarily hold money sometimes for some people without forewarning you so the poor recipient who\'s waiting in good faith for their payment now receives nothing and is told their funds are "on hold". Leaving us to explain and apologise profusely thus putting people in an awful predicament.\n\nI negotiated a purchase on a rare designer bag. It took a day of negotiations and finally, when all was agreed, I asked to make payment via PayPal. They didn\'t use it often but did have an account so they agreed. I sent the payment through, it left my account and I thought all was well. Then I started getting angry messages from the seller about wasting their time.... I had no idea what was wrong and they sent me a screenshot saying their payment was "on hold" and would not be released until the bag was delivered. I was mortified and spent another hour apologising and explaining...it was awful. Its not the holding funds that is the problem, its the fact that they don\'t tell you before you finalise and send payment. If I had known, I could have prepared the seller or maybe made alternative arrangements. The seller lost trust in me and PayPal completely ruined the delicate transaction. I had used PayPal very regularly and had never had them hold funds before so I didn\'t even consider that this might happen.\n\nI had another two terrible experiences this week. The first was with a dispute which PayPal kept messing up and prolonging.\nThey gave me an address to return my faulty item to. I sent it using a tracked service and it was attempted delivery a day later.\n\nThen I got an update on my claim saying that I should send the item to a different address!! I was furious. I called them and they were all so friendly and polite but talk in some weird circular way so that you never actually get a straight answer and they make promises to sort it out for you but don\'t actually (because decisions are made by the mysterious Back Office who no-one is able to speak directly to). I explained that I sent it to the address that they supplied me with and they couldn\'t locate the email and claimed it was maybe a spoof or spam email. It wasn\'t of course, it was just one department not knowing what the other department is doing and not passing on information. It\'s absolutely mind-bendingly stressful trying to get anything sorted with them. I actually spent 7 hours over a week on the phone with them just because of their errors on this dispute. I had to threaten to make a formal complaint and all kinds of things just for them to finally hear me and to finally properly review all the info I had sent them and see I had done my part exactly according to their instructions.\n\nThen today, a friend sent me some money but, because he is not a regular Paypal user, he accidentally clicked on the wrong button and instead of sending it as a personal payment/transfer which is free, he clicked on payment for a service. This incurs fees and I was charged £51 for this. It was a total accident, human error and has never happened before. I rang them to explain and ask if, on this one and only occasion, they would refund the payment so we could re-do as a personal transfer as it was a completely honest mistake and they would not budge an inch. So I have lost £50 to the PayPal because my friend pressed the wrong button! My friend feels absolutely terrible about it and I do too as well as being £50 out of pocket. Another day messed-up by PayPal. And it\'s easy mistake to make because the sending by "friends and family" was always obvious and visible and clear....now, it\'s still there but they don\'t make it as clear at all.\n\nAnd the other thing is receiving limits. They put receiving limits on people\'s accounts but don\'t tell them how much or even that there is a limit. So again, after negotiating a purchase from a lady in Spain, I sent through payment and it was blocked because of some sort of receiving limit. They wouldn\'t tell her or me what it was and it was such a stressful process for her to try and increase the limit that she had to cancel the transaction with me.\n\nIf they would be transparent with people so we know we have limits on spending or receiving and we know that they payment we are going to send will be put on hold, we can anticipate this and work with it.\n\nWhen we are completely in the dark and these issues pop up suddenly without warning, it completely ruins the trust between buyer and seller. I have to agree with a former comment that their practices are scandalous and shocking.\n\nI will never use PayPal again after this and do not recommend them to anyone.', 'review_date': '2021-08-24', 'review_time': '17:47:49', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

In my case by sending i lost 300 rail and the receiver did not get the amount that paypal promise the deliver. But no they also charge on other side. Which means they steal 300 from me and by delivering another 300. That makes it in total 600! Is 100 euro on fee! The funny part is that by sending they also charge with a fee from 2 euro something.

At the end i have to wait 30 days to get my money back. Is funny right. They can charge you in seconds but to send your own money back you need to wait 30 days . This the worst exchange ever exist .
