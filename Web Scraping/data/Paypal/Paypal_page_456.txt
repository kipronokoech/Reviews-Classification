You set up your account pretty easily not much is asked and you get on with it. For the most part you will maybe struggle with silly things like the bank account association will consistently be denied because PayPal doesn't recognise the IBAN spacing, if you manage to fix it of course it will be due to your own ability because the step-by-step guide provided by the help centre doesn't consider stating do not enter the spacing...... Anyways as you get on with it one day for no reason you find out you can no longer transfer money to your bank account even though it is one of the actually useful features of PayPal, it might just stop all of a sudden, you will just get a message stating “the amount you are trying to transfer is too high, please enter a lower amount” but let's not kid ourselves, you are not rich, and five euros is not a large amount of money.... but never you mind, PayPal will insist is too high even if you try sending something as low as one cent.\n\nSo, one would think, hey how about we hit the good old help centre, since they are there, they might actually be helpful!\n\nWell, no, do expect an endless parade of help desk agents with names ranging from John smith to simply Agatha, do expect them to ask you things like, have you tried sending a lower amount? It doesn't matter how many times you state it, they won't bother to read through the chat history (well they don't offer an actual phone number to call at least not through their standard channels) In fact at some point they will tell you things like direct money transfer to one's account is not possible (hell what have I been doing until now then?) Or that I should contact the Irish help desk centre (How do I do that, I am contacting you using your provided steps, I assume if I am doing so from within my Irish account, I would be referred to the Irish help centre) In the end they will just ignore you, like if you were some sort of crazy person that just had a lot of free time.\n\nEventually you might find a way around it by simply using xoom (another PayPal provided service) they might charge you for a service that was supposedly free but at this point you are just tired and want to get on with your life.\n\nBut if you thought that was it you might be surprised by a random email a month or two later that will state “Your account has been limited” (A genuine one and not your average scammers one although at this point, I am not sure if there is a difference) You might be puzzled by the news that there’s some unknown figure you weren't supposed to surpass and if you did you would have to provide “further information about who you are”\n\n- by the way you will never find out what this limiting amount is neither will you receive a warning of sorts telling you, you are near it. -\n\nSo basically, you will need to provide some sort of ID and a proof of address.... oh, but remember, when you set up your account you were at your dad's place, you don't live there anymore so you don't have a proof of address, well since this is an online service surely, I can just update my country of residency, I am after all, still living in the EU......wrong. You can't change your country of residence; you have to set up a new paypal account.", 'review_date': '2020-11-18', 'review_time': '12:28:07', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

In the future, I would not recommend anyone to deal with PayPal if they want a just decision. \nI had the case where clearly the merchandise purchased was a much lower quality than what it was advertised (it was 100% polyester instead of 100% cotton that was promised). The shipping arrived from China, which was completely unexpected as it was an American website, so when I had to return the products I had to ship it back to China. The cheapest shipping was £11.25 (1/3 of the cost of the total purchase) and it was not trackable, however it had a Royal Mail internal (PRN) tracker. The online trackable package would cost ~£20 which would be 1/2 of the cost of the total purchase. I have provided a picture of the package to PayPal where one can clearly see the stamp, the required address and that it was taken inside the post office (already behind the counter glass). The merchant has clearly received the package and didn't bother to process the refund, while PayPal didn't want to go out of their way and call Royal Mail (if they really needed a further proof) to see if the package arrived using the internal tracker provided. Instead, they blamed that I have not sent the goods back. So I have now lost the total cost of the purchase (~£40.00) + £11.25 for shipping and I don't have any purchased goods. It does feel like a day-time robbery to be honest. \nI will make sure to leave bad reviews for both the merchant and PayPal and try to get media on this case. The merchant probably doesn't care about it as they are based in China (and the review I already left on their website wasn't published). However, PayPal might care about it and change their internal policy on how they deal with cases like this. \nPublic has trust in PayPal to protect them from scam. They also trust PayPal to do due diligence on their merchants. However, this is a clear case that PayPal wants to be seen in the same bucket as their scam merchants.", 'review_date': '2020-11-18', 'review_time': '10:08:49', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

The quality of their service is really going downhill. I bought an item from China and it never arrived. I had to open a case with PayPal. The seller then sent a tracking number for another item they'd sold to my country, but the postcode on their tracking number didn't match my address so it was clearly fraudulent. Despite that, PayPal sided with the seller and I didn't get my refund. I sent dozens of emails pointing out that the tracking number was not related to my item, but the automated systems and the bots didn't listen and kept siding with the seller. So I ended up with no item and no money.\n\nFrankly, the unscrupulous Chinese sellers have found innovative new ways to scam buyers and PayPal hasn't kept up. I started a support thread on their forums describing my experience, and dozens of members have reported the same scam happening to them - and PayPal's buyer protection didn't protect them.
