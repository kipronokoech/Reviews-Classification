I did this because I opened up a new bank account and was closing the old one. By doing this it had made, in theory, the new account listed as the primary defaulted funding source, and the old account as a back up funding source. On May 3, 2022 to May 6, 2022 I had made some charges through by debit Mastercard with them. A total of 5 charges in which they now refuse to collect the amounts on the proper primary defaulted account that I listed with them. Instead they continue to try and charge my old bank account which I have since deleted from the platform. This has caused me to incur a large amount of insufficient bank fees and the account will not close now as a result of their poor actions. I have been on the phone with them twice, both times told that they would fix this and both times outright lied to because it keeps happening. I have resorted to electronic communication with them, and now I am on my 5th attempt to get this resolve as they keep pretending they have no idea what I am talking about. This is CRIMINAL behavior. At this point I am putting them on notice that since they do not want to do the right thing, that they are 100% responsible for all my banking fees and will be going after them for paying. On top of all this they have of course restricted my account because they refuse to collect upon the charges I made through the right bank account. Paypal is the worst and they are a rogue company now.

Some years ago when I was a minor I had PayPal and rarely ever used it besides once or twice. Then one day a guy gave me $700 then charged back $700 leaving me with a -700 dollar PayPal balance, I thought “okay this is probably a common scam and it should get resolved quickly” ohhh boy was I wrong… I went through weeks every day calling them speaking to 100s of different people, probably 20 hours combined of talking to brick walls, just to get told by some high ranking employee “there’s nothing we can do” so I hang up, and refuse to pay my negative balance, PayPal literally robbed me of $700 so there’s no way I should be expected to pay that, afew days later I got a letter from a creditor demanding I pay $700. Luckily I was a minor at the time so I was able to pull that card and get out of it, if I wasn’t I would’ve been robbed $700. Anyway recently aka yesterday I was forced to use PayPal to sell items of mine for quick money which I need badly at the moment for personal reasons, as much as I dreaded signing up again I had to, so I sold $1000 worth of items and guess what?? Despite the buyer of my items already having the items I now have to WAIT 21 DAYS TO GET MY MONEY, they are holding my money, of which should be mine for no reason. I would rather drag my balls across miles of rusted nails, cutco kitchen knives, glass, lava, sharp cut diamonds, literally hell itself then ever, ever, EVER have to use this terrible service again.', 'review_date': '2022-05-13', 'review_time': '08:05:28', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

I’ll always hear the stories about getting your account banned but didn’t pay too much attention to it wondering if people did really violate their policies. Then it happened to me, I had a personal account for over 15 years (which I successfully closed today thank God) and then opened a business account and got banned right away for 180 days. No apparent reason, just an AI doing his job and beautiful algorithms designed by a nerd with no human social skills. No customer support whatsoever nobody could tell me why they banned the account. It had money in it, so I will have to wait till December to start a dispute. PayPal outlined in the email they sent me that I was a high risk customer, but you know what, in reality PayPal is the one who should be tag as high risk, freezing accounts, withholding money with no explanation, no investigation, making accusations and assumptions, impossible customer service, etc. Switch to Stripe, they have better reviews and so far are working fine. Bottom line if you want to gamble with your money of one day waking up and watching your money be taken by an AI and bots, I think it is better to go over to a casino at least here you have a better chance of not losing your money.', 'review_date': '2022-05-13', 'review_time': '05:36:45', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
