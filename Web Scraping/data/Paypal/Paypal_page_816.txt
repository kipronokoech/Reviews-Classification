At the most 48 hours.\n\nPaypal will be losings customers for sure including myself.\nSoon to be left behind by Crypto based blockchain tech which is close to being available so soon goodbye PayPal.\n\nUTRUST is the first cryptocurrency payment platform in the world that provides buyers with a purchase protection. The next-gen version of PayPal is Blockchain-based and designed to make online payments safer, faster and cheaper.\n\nApplying the blockchain to, for example, a payment service essentially automates the role of the middleman. If person A wants to securely send money to person B, he can rely on PayPal, that will carry out all the labor that's required to administrate and secure that payment, while in turn taking a fee.\n\nThat fee needs to cover PayPal's payroll, employee benefits, inventory, materials, supplies, overhead, operating expenses, taxes, and insurance, after which it can finally yield a profit. Fortunately for PayPal, its competitors all need to account for those same costs, so any competitive advantage only comes from the margins and/or scale.\n\nBut that same payment service, founded on a decentralized network like REQ and UTRUST is free from those tremendous costs. The blockchain, not salaried employees, administrates and validates. This is true efficiency, and it is a COLOSSAL competitive advantage.\n\nPlease research for yourself.\n\nGoodbye the middleman PayPal!\n\nI cannot wait!!", 'review_date': '2018-03-30', 'review_time': '12:10:45', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
