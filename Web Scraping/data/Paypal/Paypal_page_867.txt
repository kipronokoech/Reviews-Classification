Without doubt if you are a business starting out please read the reviews from other businesses whom have experienced dealing with PayPal and warn other newly formed enterprises to not engage with them.\n\nThe reason for this warning is that their consumer protection policy, whilst great for those who purchase through PayPal, is seriously crippling for a small business that requires cashflow. We are a company whom sells a service and gains payment before delivery. Upon processing a sizeable revenue amount through PayPal and trying to withdraw it to carry out our business operations we were told that we would not be able to access 38% of the funds due to PayPal's policy around maintaining a capital amount in the case of refund requests. Whilst i agree with and am happy to accept PayPal putting aside an amount around 10% for customer returns the amount of 38% was unconscionable as ultimately it put our business at serious financial risk due to us relying on those funds to deliver the service.\n\nThe worst part was that having put us through all amounts of stress to find debt funding to cover the amount PayPal informed us that they would be keeping the amount for 6 months beyond successful delivery of the service. Our customers had received their service and signed legal contracts waiving their right to claim refund through PayPal or us directly and yet PayPal would not recognise this and provide us our capital.\n\nEscalating this basic and logical request to executive complaints and the financial ombudsman in Australia, PayPal has refused to even consider the idea of providing us the funds. Thus we are in a situation where we have not been able to access funds to carry out the specific operations relating to purchase and will not be able to access them for 10 months since opening the account and 8 months post closing our relationship with PayPal- 9 months after the service has been delivered.\n\nThis company is blatantly unethical and the worst company I have ever dealt with. Even despite the thousands of negative reviews on this website and others I feel it is my duty to all other business owners out there to highlight these practices and warn against considering PayPal for anything to do with your business. Fortunately there are other options available out there now and, in our experience, consumers have not blinked at processing funds through them as they trust our company and reputation- not something I can say for PayPal.", 'review_date': '2016-10-06', 'review_time': '23:44:24', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

Six weeks ago PayPal emailed me to inform me they had put a 100% reserve on my account. The reason being an unusual rise in the number of disputes opened by my customers.\n\nAt the time I was using another pathetic company, a courier company called MyHermes, who had misplaced and lost a numerous amount of parcels. This obviously led to some unhappy customers, but because MyHermes\' customer service is painful, it took a long time to get a response from them on the whereabouts of the missing parcels.\n\nMeanwhile, I had impatient customers emailing me demanding refunds. I did explain the situation to them, but was obviously cautious of issuing refunds until I had a response from MyHermes on the whereabouts of the parcel. This led to the customers opening disputes through PayPal which resulted in the 100% reserve.\n\nI called PayPal at this point and was told if I could resolved the disputes that are currently open, they would then review my account and I should have access to my balance as normal. So after reinvesting on stock that MyHermes had lost (which was more than £2k) and resending to customers, and inputting the tracking details on PayPal, I then contacted them the next day to ask why the disputes that I had fulfilled (again) were still showing as open. There explanation was it\'s up to the customer to close the dispute. So I then had to email each individual customer begging them to close the dispute so I could regain access to my money.\n\nPayPal still held 100% of my balance even whilst I was still bringing sales in through PayPal. Any sales I made would go straight into my "pending" balance, and even if a customer decided to cancel the order and want a refund, I would have to source the refund amount from my bank account, whilst PayPal held the original transaction.\n\nSo after explaining this situation over and over again to different people each time I rang PayPal, eventually on the 22nd September they decided to "review" my account and asked me for certain information such as projections for the next six months, information about the business, and even a bank statement to prove my business could cope with the amount of transactions going through the system!\n\nOnly today (4th October) I had a response saying they have decided to close my account and any "pending" funds are held for up to 180 days! They apparently review this every 30 days and release "some" funds each 30 days but there are no guarantees they will release anything.\n\nWhilst I understand they are a business and they obviously have liabilities, such as customers putting in disputes and asking for refunds, which they explained this is the reason they are holding my balance. However, of the £5.5k they are holding, the majority of that balance is orders that I have fulfilled (twice on some of them due to the missing parcels mentioned earlier) therefore they are holding payments from transactions that have been completed!\n\nIf you are a seller and sell via a website other than eBay, go for Google Checkout or ApplePay. On this occasion the disputes were no fault of my own, but as a seller you are highly likely to experience impatient customers from time to time and disputes are unavoidable at times, but PayPal don\'t seem to see this from a seller’s point of view.', 'review_date': '2016-10-04', 'review_time': '19:24:13', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

At least that’s what the company claims.\n\nBut just how happy are the customers on the receiving end of those payments? Not very, according to those who’ve been subjected to their so-called “security checks”.\n\nAround Mid-October Emma Fox sold a bag through E- bay. When she then tried to withdraw the funds a confirmation screen appeared to advise it would take 4 hours, followed by a subsequent possible 2 hours.\n\nAfter the 6 hours the money hadn’t appeared in her account so they decided to email PayPal. Paypal did write back to say it was because of security checking reasons, although they couldn’t tell them why the security checks took place and that it would take 72 hours for the money to reach our account.\n\nPayPal’s security processes are designed to combat fraud and money laundering. But in September a technical glitch in updating their systems led to additional checks and delays for a number of customers.\n\nAt the start of October, PayPal claimed it had fixed the problem, and said all transfers should take place within 6hours but this was a surprise to Emma.\n\nLater in October Emma had a further 2 items to sell, one being a vehicle which was close to £1000 and they experienced the same problem. They had to wait for 3 days for a lot of money to be transferred into their account.\n\n“You want to know your money is safe and secure yet they cannot give you an explanation as to why they need to hold onto it for that long.”\n\nAt least Emma eventually got her money. But for others, PayPal’s “fast, safe and simple” way of paying has been anything but.\n\nJosh Sewell’s friend owed him money for a holiday and decided to pay Josh back by PayPal.\n\nSo he sent £810 pounds into his PayPal account and withdrew it to his bank but within an hour or so Josh got an email saying it had been stopped and that there was an enquiry into this transaction.\n\nPayPal said there was an “unusual pattern of activity” on Josh’s account. It held on to the money for 2 weeks – then sent it back to his friend, without permission.\n\nLuckily for Josh it was a friend but if he was selling something on E-bay which was worth that much money and didn’t know the person, then that could have caused real trouble.\n\n“I thought the customer service was terrible...We made numerous emails and calls to the company but the people at the other end were like robots.. they just gave the same answer.. no one had any authority to deal with the situation.”\n\nJosh now has his money after his friend paid him in cash but his problems continue as his account is still limited. His girlfriend’s account is also limited because they linked their accounts and thought they were the same person. So neither of them can use E-bay or paypal.\n\nLuckily for Josh, he doesn’t rely on PayPal for his living. For online traders and businesses, a frozen account can spell disaster.\n\nJake Wright ran a business selling video games through websites including E-bay and the money was handled by Paypal.\n\nOne day he got a notification that his PayPal account had been limited and in turn his E-bay account had been suspended.\n\nThey had to send all company documentation such as supplier invoices, his own identification, bank statements to E-bay but were then told by them that this was not sufficient - because the documents were illegible. They checked and resent the files - again to be met by the same response every time.\n\nPayPal told Jake his account was considered high risk and to make matters worse E-bay contacted his clients directly.\n\nJake says, “E bay contacted all of our customers with a fraud alert notification. They told them they should raise a resolution in their resolution centre against us. Even though the customers had already received the products they’d paid for. Ultimately it meant we had to sell the assets of the company, and wind down trading...there seems to be no sensible appeals process.”\n\nNo-one can doubt the importance of internet security to PayPal but by freezing accounts and holding onto thousands of pounds of customers’ money for months at a time - for some customers at least, could it be that PayPal itself has become an online risk?\n\nCompany Response\n\n\nWatchdog has been in touch with PayPal who have looked at the customers cases and sent us the following statement:\n\nMost of our 15 million UK customers find that things go smoothly with PayPal, but we don’t always get it right. We recognise the need to improve and are investing significantly in our customer service centres in Ireland, where we are recruiting an extra 1,000 people by 2015.\n\nWe don’t arbitrarily freeze accounts. Sometimes we have to apply restrictions in response to negative buyer feedback; to comply with financial regulations; or if there is an unusual spike in payments. While our security measures can seem frustrating to some customers, they are essential tools that ensure our customers can make fast and easy payments.", 'review_date': '2016-10-03', 'review_time': '13:41:00', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

This will give you the upper hand. PAYPAL ENCOURAGES BUYERS TO FILE DISPUTES : When you call PayPal the first thing you will hear over and over again is PayPal telling buyer's to file disputes. PayPal does this on purpose and buyer's abuse the dispute system. They will hold the seller responsible for PayPal telling buyer's to file all sorts of disputes for whatever reason. PAYPAL WILL ALWAYS SIDE WITH THE BUYER ESPECIALLY IF THE BUYER USES A CREDIT CARD They do this because they know they are the ones that legally charged the buyer's credit card. So in order to save their own buts, PayPal will screw over the seller each and every time. PayPal is not a bank but a merchant with a credit card machine charging accounts. PayPal MUST comply with the disputes process set forth by Visa, Mastercard, Discover and Amex. The seller has no recourse of getting their money because PayPal is holding it and there's no financial way of getting it back. PayPal will never go into a sellers bank account or charge their credit card because they know the seller can dispute the charges PayPal initiated. That's why they screw sellers over each and every time because in order to avoid PayPal having a lose, they will steal everything from sellers to avoid the possibility of a buyer calling their credit card company, filing a dispute, and having the credit card company take the funds away from PayPal. DO NOT FAX ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION TO PAYPAL LIKE DRIVERS LICENSE UTILITY BILL ETC. The reason and only reason why they ask for this information is so that they can (1) send a collection agency after you and (2) have information connected to you if you try to open another account. Once your limited you say limited, if you were on a 21 day hold all of the sudden for whatever reason, any type of dispute filed by the buyer - fraudulent or not, your one step away from having your account limited.
