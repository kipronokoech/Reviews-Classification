First they get to keep the transaction fee, then they get a service fee, then a dispute fee, then they make .05% on the currency exchange. I sold a LP for $25 on the Discogs website, the buyer claimed a inner sleeve was missing, this was a 50 year old recording, so I didn't know anything about this inner sleeve. I offered a partial refund, which he refused, and filed a complaint with PayPal. His complaint had several untruths, however, even after sending all messages between us, PalPal ruled in his favour. He put a mark on the vinyl, when he pulled it out its sleeve. But a photo time stamped even if it doesn't prove anything, I guess is good enough for PayPal. I ended up paying back $87, despite the fact that he lied about the condition of the LP, when the inner sleeve complaint was exhausted. PayPal also doesn't feel that a buyer harassing a seller with over 30 emails - which I had to answer to stop my account with Discogs from being suspended - is out of line. The irony in all this is, after I played the record I no longer wanted to sell it, because it was an exceptional recording. I decided it was good customer service to let him buy it, seller's remorse big time.", 'review_date': '2021-01-22', 'review_time': '02:19:34', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
