Once I realized I had been duped, I filed a claim immediately with Paypal via their online forms. It was totally impossible to contact any live person during this dispute. The fraudulent Web site produced a tracking number from my local post office showing the item was delivered, but the tracking number referred to some other residence in my zip code, not my house. I obtained a letter from the post office verifying that the tracking number was not my address. Paypal refused to consider this evidence and dismissed my case, with no way to reopen the case on their site. Paypal clearly has no interest in protecting its customers from nefarious merchants. In this day of rampant fraud on the Internet, I strongly urge others to use their credit card and not Paypal.

We bought an oil delivery for £1055 from Boiker Juice (don’t ever use them also). Basically, the oil wasn’t added to the tank when they delivered as they didn’t find the tank so they left my property. I rang BJ and was pretty annoyed, cancelled the order and ordered from a local delivery agent. BJ then re delivered when we had already had new oil delivered and could only fit a small amount in the tank - which of course we didn’t want. We advised BJ to refund, they refused. Not only had they taken my money without authorisation and delivered something we didn’t want, they refused to even give us the rest of our money back for a huge under delivery. So, we presumed PayPal would help. It’s been 3 months and PayPal have again found in favour of the oil company. They seem to pay no attention to the facts - even if I was to pay for the oil I didn’t want the company should refund me about 780£ as they couldn’t deliver the whole order! PayPal repeatedly loose evidence provided by myself and merely say ‘no evidence submitted so case closed’, say the description of the case doesn’t match the claim (there are no suitable titles to submit under!) - today they’ve dismissed my claim as the title was ‘significantly different from description’ - but totally dismissed the fact that a) the order was cancelled so BJ shouldn’t have delivered or use my money and b) they only delivered a fraction of the oil agreed and therefore owe me £100’snkf pounds. Assistants promise you they will help - and the. Never make contact again. You can’t speak to anyone in disputes so no one understands your case.\nPayPal are bullies who are not members of the finance committee which govern uk finance since we left Europe - hence they are getting away with financial murder,\nI will delete my account and have to go to small claims court now.

Here\'s how they\'ve insulted me enough to receive my indignance and this review:\n\nSuddenly the default payment by my credit card on my paypal account was no longer an option. And the default was now a credit option with a zero interest rate.\n\nI tried paypal\'s "pay in four payments" zero-interest option a few times in the past with zero problems, so I simply completed my transaction with their credit option default.\n\nI repeat: my original default credit card payment option was not even extant. I wasn\'t there to be found.\n\nSo I used this credit default a couple times. Not a large total. (Hundreds, not thousands.)\n\nWhen I called to make a payment --hopefully by my normal default credit card-- I was told by someone they had to transfer me. Then that happened from the second person, too. Then I was at Synchrony bank. I don\'t like Synchrony bank, I learned from the folderol through Amazon "credit" that I never asked for, too. I cancelled Synchrony after the Amazon credit fiasco.\n\nWell, now, here they are from paypal --again without my having ever asked them to become my creditor. (I did make the mistake of presuming the credit option that was the default by paypal in place of my normal, usual default credit card pay-in-full option was paypal. I had no idea I was suddenly in bed with Synchrony again.)\n\nSo I called paypal again. And again. Asking for a supervisor. I was told a supervisor would return the call. That day. "In an hour of two." Nope. No return call.\n\nAnd now there is an interest charge --of a usury fee rate, no less-- on my few hundred dollars.\n\nThis is crooked.\n\nThis is what we used to call "rip-off."\n\nAnd can one speak with anyone live?\n\nNot at paypal, no. One can get transferred to Synchrony after much folderol.
