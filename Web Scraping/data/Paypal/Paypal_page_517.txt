I completed PayPal\'s dispute / resolution / claim process and requested reimbursement for the one item - noting that I\'d be keeping the other 5. The Vendor responded within the process and offered a full refund of my entire order if I returned "all" items with their original packaging, tags, etc. Since I intended to keep the 5, I no longer had the packaging. The resolution process however stated that I had only one option - return everything and get a full refund. The system is so automated that it can\'t go beyond the structure established. I had no way of letting PayPal know what was going on and that the Vendor\'s response was in fact abusing their system. I did send an e-mail to their customer service, but got back what appeared to be a "canned" response which was of NO help. I will NEVER trust PayPal to protect me from such abuse.

Paypal was being so argumentative that the address was correct when it was not and refused to give me back my money OR reopen my case!!!!!!!!\n\nPaypal is one of the worst company that I have ever came across/experienced in my life. Not only did paypal give my money to a dishonest customer but they also blamed the third party organisation for the fault of the situation.
