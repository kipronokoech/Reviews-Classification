There is Zero way to talk to someone live. You send them a message on their "chat" and the only thing you get back is generic copy paste answers. The same stuff you get when following the directions before giving up and trying to talk to these losers. I had an unauthorized transaction. Someone somehow got into my account and tried to send themselves several thousands of $$. My bank declined them all except one for $750.00. I marked it as unauthorized in the paypal app and they respond telling me it was authorized. I can\'t get anyone on the phone since the number listed just says the call can\'t be completed and hangs up.
