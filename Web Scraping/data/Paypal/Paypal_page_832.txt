Since May 2, 2016, I have received a total of 51 payments to my PayPal account, all of which have come from the same company. There have never been any disputes, problems, chargebacks, etc. with these payments or the associated transfers of these payments to my linked bank account.\n\nI received a payment on November 16, 2017. When I went to transfer the payment to my bank account (as I have done with no issue for the past 50 payments from this company), I saw that there was a 21 day hold on my funds with what appears to be an explanation of "eBay non-performer." I do not sell, and have never sold, anything on eBay. After looking into this issue on the PayPal site, I found that a hold may be placed on funds for the following reasons:\n\n1. You\'re new to selling and accepting PayPal as your payment method. (No issue here)\n2. Your customers indicate issues about your selling performance. (No issue here)\n3. The payment you received may be considered unusual for your selling pattern. (No issue here)\n\nI called PayPal on November 16, 2017 and explained the issue in detail to the CSR. He advised that I should mark this transaction as processed, which I did (this reduced the hold from 21 days to 7 days). He also stated that he would submit the hold on my funds for review, and that it generally took about 1-2 hours before they would review and I would receive a reply by email once the review was complete.\n\nOn November 17, 2017 (after 15 hours with no reply), I called PayPal again, briefly explained the situation to the CSR that answered, and asked to speak with someone that could review my account and remove the hold on my funds. After roughly 20 minutes on hold, I spoke with a woman who identified herself as a supervisor. After she reviewed my account, she told me that there were no issues with my account and that the "system" periodically does this to accounts to make sure there is nothing wrong. I reminded her that she stated there was nothing wrong with my account and asked if she could remove the hold. She stated that she did not have a button to click to remove the hold, and that the system had designated that the hold would be removed and funds would be available on November 23, 2017. I asked if she could connect me to someone that could remove the hold on my funds, and she told me that there was no one that could do that. Surprised by this reply, I asked her again if there was no human that worked for PayPal that could manually remove the hold that the "system" had placed on my funds. She told me there was not.\n\nI was essentially told that the computers are running the show at PayPal and nobody is able to override the "system\'s" poor decisions.', 'review_date': '2017-11-22', 'review_time': '01:35:49', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
