They changed my transaction to one that incurred a fee.\n\nIn April, I made a person to person payment and there was no fee applied. On my mobile device, I visited PayPal again. There was a link to "Send Again" and since I wanted to send additional money to the same person in the same manner, I clicked the link. Only this time, a $58.30 fee was taken out of the amount with no warnings or any indication that any fee would be charged. I was agreeing to make the same person to person payment that I had made in April and had no way to know that PayPal would change it to a business transaction. I did not agree to pay a fee for this transaction since I can pay the person in cash and will be able to trust that there will be no hidden fees.\n\nAs soon as my friend told me that she had not received the entire amount entered, I attempted to contact Customer Service. I tried many times to call and, after staying on hold, it would always hang up. I finally decided that I had to resolve it online. Not having had a problem with PayPal before, I thought the Resolution Center seemed like a good place to start in getting a problem resolved. Turns out I was wrong. I filled out the electronic form the best that I could. It asked for the disputed amount and I tried to enter the entire amount ($2000), but it wouldn\'t let me so I put in the closest that I could: $1999.99 and then in the free text part of the form, I described my problem indicating that I had a problem with the fee. I have no issue with the person I sent the money to. I only have a problem with PayPal, since it changed the transaction type without approval or notice and charged a fee. Neither my nor I were sure what to do, and she approved the penny refund. Now they are saying that my case is closed and it was in my favor. But my issue is with PayPal and their unfair $58.30 fee. I still have not been able to talk with anyone at PayPal about the problem. I\'m frustrated and disgusted. I will always use another method of money transfer.
