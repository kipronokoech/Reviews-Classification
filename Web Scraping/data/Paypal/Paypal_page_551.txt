In my case, I run a hand crafted jewelry business and scammers where getting a $300 handmade ring and then their $300 back also because PayPal never looks at these cases. I ended up removing PayPal as an option from my website after 7 years because they would not protect me as a seller from the scams.

I was notified via email of a recurring charge to my PayPal account. I have never set up recurring payments, signed up for subscriptions, nothing - not even for monthly bills. I contacted PayPal about the unauthorized payment and they refused to stand behind me. Said I'd have to contact the seller, and surprise, surprise, the seller couldn't be reached. I went into my PayPal account to remove my banking information and close it, but received a message that neither could be completed and to call or message PayPal directly. After several phone calls where an automated machine let me know that no one could be reached, I moved on to messaging. For that, I was quoted a 3 hour wait time and roughly an hour and a half later, finally had someone responding. I clearly explained my desire to close the account, and received a bunch of pre-generated responses. Went back and forth a few times and kept pushing to close. Finally, the person on the other end actually typed a response and said I'd have to wait for the (unauthorized) transaction to finish posting to my account. I asked about removing my banking info and got the same response. (Meanwhile, I'm on the phone with customer service through my bank and succeeded in blocking all payments submitted from PayPal.) Getting no where through messaging - a bunch more pre-generated nonsense, I let them know this and further stressed that I just wanted to remove my banking information, and they closed out the conversation! So, not only do they not have your back in fraudulent or unauthorized payments, but they'll block you from being able to remove your banking info or closing your account. It's truly scary. I may try one more time to close it, but without success (which I'm thinking is pretty likely at this point), I'll be closing and reopening a new checking. Truly a pain in my bum, but I'm highly uncomfortable having my personal information just sitting out there and I clearly can't trust PayPal.", 'review_date': '2020-07-20', 'review_time': '16:24:15', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
