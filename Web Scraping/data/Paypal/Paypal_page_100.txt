Below is a message they sent me holding my money being a genuine person with all the documents can be proven correct.\n\nDear Chaminda Gunawardena,\n\nWe appreciate your interest in PayPal; however, our decision to leave your account in a permanent limitation status is final.\n\nPayPal reserves the right to limit access to any account reported to be involved in possible fraudulent or high risk behavior. In the event of a dispute, PayPal will seek to recover the funds from you by debiting your PayPal balance and, if there are not sufficient funds in your PayPal balance, PayPal reserves the right to collect your debt to PayPal by any other legal means.\n\nIf you want to refund your buyers, you are able to do that any time as long as the status of the transaction is completed. To issue a refund, go to the activity page, click the payment you want to refund, and click refund this payment.\n\nIf you do not have the ability to process a refund, you can reply to this email with the transaction details. We’ll send a refund on your behalf using money from your PayPal balance.\n\nDue to the potential risk of chargebacks and other risks of funds reversals, your balance will be held 180 days from the date of the limitation. At that time, any remaining funds will be available for withdrawal.\n\nI advise nobody to open new account with them and choose alternative platforms.', 'review_date': '2023-02-25', 'review_time': '02:26:46', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
