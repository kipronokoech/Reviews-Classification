Four months into my paypal credit agreement I have experienced nothing but trouble. Every month there has been a problem at their end with taking payments. Again this month, I have had another issue. After another conversation with one of their managers, it emerged that every purchase I have made since has also gone onto my paypal credit despite the fact that I have never been informed of this. I have just had to pay off credit that I assumed had been taken from my bank account over the past few months, rather than added onto a credit (with an APR of 17.5%) that I had never knowingly agreed to. It is a very sneaky way of make money by paypal. Stealth credit. I wanted to let you know as it's a poor partnership by Apple and I think people should know about the terrible service and disgraceful and shameful way paypal are getting people into debt.", 'review_date': '2015-04-06', 'review_time': '12:13:04', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
