I received an email 3 days ago stating I can no longer do business on PayPal my account was suspended permanently and they were holding my funds. PayPal would not give me an exact reason as to why I was suspended just stated restricted items. Then I filed a claim with the BBB. PayPal responded with complete lies on the BBB report. They stated I received $2600 in friends/family payments then when I called PayPal to show me where I received that money they could not tell me because I didn’t receive it. They also stated I had one or more accounts associated with my account which is also a lie too I only have 1 account. So PayPal literally shut me down for no reason and then made up reasons for my suspension which they could not back up! Apparently PayPal thinks no one has authority over them and they can just lie to the Better Business Bureau. I will be suing PayPal and they will pay for what they have done to me. I caught them lying to the BBB and I have literal proof.\n\nPayPal needs to be shut down they are a bunch of lying dirty crooks. They will suspend you at will for literally no reason and freeze your funds for 180 days and maybe even take it. Do not use PayPal do not pay using their gateway if you can avoid it for every payment you make using their system they get paid. We need to wake up the masses to what PayPal does to honest hard working people and hit them where it hurts. If everyone stops using PayPal there will be no PayPal. Who’s with me? Do it now before you too are suspended!!!!!!!!!!!! Dirtiest company in the world! Why would you shut down a legitimate business after doing business for 9 years with no issues. More and more people are currently getting suspended PayPal is up to something and it should be highly illegal!\n\nAlso because I’m smart instead of PayPal stealing my money at the end like everyone else I never kept my money in PayPal. I ended up with $12k of their money which I will hold for a year and pay it back as slowly as possible.

I ended up asking paypal to step in. It seemed clear cut to me. The seller sold me earrings that he confirmed (in writing and in his ad) to be 14K. Then, I realized they were not...because they caused me to have an allergic reaction. This usually happens if the alloys are less than 14K. A jeweler confirmed the mark is not 14K and I have many pictures. The stones are also not what was in the ad. I sent paypal the ad, the clear pictures of the 10K (not 14K) and the message screen shots of the seller offering me $50.00 (which was not enough but an admission of guilt). Paypal denied my claim and stated that I had "altered the item" and yet they gave me no evidence of this conclusion. They quite simply don\'t care that I was frauded. I would have been better served by going straight through my credit card company. It\'s too late now. I\'m shocked that I spend so much with paypal and I believed they would protect me. They don\'t care. They don\'t seem to do what\'s right but what\'s easy. I am no longer a faithful customer and will find another way to pay. I feel I was frauded twice.
