Then i tried to open an ebay shop, and, after having done everything correctly an made ONE sale, Paypal put a hold on my account. Then Paypal put a hold on my account under their Acceptable Use Policy. So, now, vaping breached that policy where before it was fine. This is all because everything is controlled or influenced by Big Tobacco. These decisions are purely political.\n\nElectronic cigarettes have been shown many times (Royal College of Physicians, Royal College of Surgeons, Royal College of Nursing, Public Health England) to be 95% less harmful than smoking, yet still this corporate prejudice persists, so the big boys can stay mates with Big Tobacco.

They locked it because my wife has sent me money a few times & I pull it out or use my PayPal card to buy things. ummm ain't that what PayPal is for ? I'm very confused. Anyway they want so much from me that I feel is none of there business & my private things. So I called & the lady was Hella rude until I got her to understand my wife sent me money on multiple occasions because I'm old school, I like my money in cash in my wallet or my safe, so I don't use plastic much & for a long time was happy using PayPal for the few things I needed a card for, then her attitude changed & she told me don't worry about 18 of the things they wanted & just upload my ID & Proof that the card linked to paypal is mine. & that's all I needed for them to unlock my account. so I did upload those things & even like 4 other things they wanted but not all 20 because some of it is private & not their business. But here it is about 4 days after I called & account is still locked & they sent me another mail saying they want to know what every money in account was from, what every purchase I made was for, if things were shipped, if things were shipped to me, shipped from me, really why is that even they're concern. I'm sure there are tons of people who use PayPal to send money to their wife for their wife send money to them what is the problem? So I talked to them online after talking to her they said they needed all those things I said I was not comfortable giving them some of them & I don't feel like I should have to tell them what every purchase was what every dollar went to So they threatened to on December 3rd put more limitations on my account OK what else are you gonna do? make it where I can't put money in the PayPal account because right now I can't use none of my money in there but can put more in, who in there right mind would add money somewhere that you can't use it? is that even legal? can they keep my money. I guess it's time to try someone else maybe cash app or oxygen. There are so many in competention with them now it's ridiculous. highly doubt Ill be going back to using them this has really made me angry & screwed up things I needed to use a card for.
