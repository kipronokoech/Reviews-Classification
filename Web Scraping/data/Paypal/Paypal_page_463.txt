I\'ve been using them for the longest time and this incident is the final straw. About 3 nights ago, they locked me out of my account due to "suspicious activity" under the guise that they\'re "watching out for me." Yeah, whatever. I couldn\'t answer the 2/3 of the verification questions, because 1.) I did not have a mobile phone with service at that time and 2.) Who the hell remembers their security questions from so long ago anyways?! Apparently, for whatever asinine and stupid reason, paypal made that an absolute factor in getting back into your account. So I decided to email and call them. Long waiting time, so I had them call me back. The agent made it seem like having a mobile phone would solve my problems so I immediately went to my nearest mobile store (Boost) and bought their cheapest option (costing around $150), so now I\'m stretched thin with money. So, I called them back again yesterday and even the mobile phone didn\'t help me and the guy kept apologizing for taking so long getting back to me with each thing he had to say (20 minutes sometimes >_>). Ultimately, he couldn\'t help me either and he said he\'d get his supervisor to handle it and they will call me back in 48 hours at a time of my choosing. Still waiting. Also, I can\'t even log in at this point without an error message saying they can\'t verify that its me<- you know, the same guy who has been using your stupid service for so long without any incidents this major -_- Now, I can\'t even pay for stuff that has a deadline and these sites are probably going to block me, even though I\'ve been an avid patron of these sites for like 5 years.
