I used Paypal as they offered security on transactions, in reality they dont, they seem to protect sellers more than customer, obviously as they make money from them.\nI made a transaction and the goods were never received, Paypal investigated and erred on the side of the seller, even though i categorically did not receive the goods found in the sellers favour.
