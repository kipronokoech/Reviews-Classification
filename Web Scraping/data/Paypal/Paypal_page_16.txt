I trusted this service completely until recently when two online transactions, totalling ¬£133,80 were debited by PayPal from my bank account.\n\nI did not order/agree to buy the goods in question. Nor did I authorise the debits for such from my account. The goods were unsolicited; the payments unauthorised.\n\nI notified the seller, Label Products, and PayPal of these unsolicited goods and the unauthorised payments for such via PayPal. I informed both parties that my intention was to return the goods and seek a full refund.\n\nWhat followed comprised poor management of a customer's concerns by Label Products and, more disappointingly, PayPal.\n\nIn essence, both parties inferred I was being less than truthful about my claim. The seller argued the two sales were legitimate. Paypal's resolution facility determined the debits were authorised.\n\nLabel Products then embarked on a path to convince me not to return the goods by offering me a 20% discount on the purchases. I refused as I did not want or order the items, or authorise the payment for them. This was followed up by a further offer of a 30% discount if I kept the unsolicited goods. I refused and advised that, as they were not listening to me, I would pursue the matter through the small claims court.\n\nIt was after this response to the seller, that I was contacted by PayPal. Surprisingly, they stated that, following my appeal, they now considered the transactions were unauthorised and they would refund my payments in full.\n\nWhilst happy the correct decision had been made - eventually, I was somewhat confused regarding the sudden u-turn by PayPal. Also, I had not appealed their original decision as inferred by PayPal, as I was considering my options.\n\nI still await an explanation from PayPal why a decision that the debits were authorised was changed to their present unauthorised status.\n\nWhen I queried PayPal about when the refund would be made, they responded by saying they had no knowledge of my refund.\n\nLater that day, however, I received a refund from PayPal for the full amount.\n\nI still await further contact from the seller relative to the return of the unsolicited goods.\n\nI have lost all trust in PayPal after these events. They have been less than transparent with me over this whole fiasco.\n\nI have since emailed PayPal's enquiries section and stated my intention to close my account with the company. No response received.\n\nI have attempted, in vain, to close my PayPal account via their app. On each of eight occasions, over several days, I was confronted with the message, 'We are sorry we are not able to process your request. Please try again in a little while.'\n\nI have contacted PayPal's enquiries section again and given notification that, with immediate effect, I was closing my account and they were no longer authorised access to any of my bank accounts.\n\nI have waited more than, '.. a little while...' for Paypal's explanation why they initially declared the debits authorised, then changed their finding to unauthorised.
