The agent said to come back to them after the delivery date which the seller cleverly put 3 months ahead to hope customers would forget and then steal their money.\n\nI explained this to the agent but s/he wouldn't listen so I closed the chat. 3 months pass and I go on Paypal again and explained the situation once more. After waiting 3 months, I found out that Paypal won't give me a full refund to my credit card. They offered me only Paypal Credit and it was set to expire in 2 months. Seriously???
