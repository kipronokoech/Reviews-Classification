Well the name first of all should be ScamAssist not PayPal tbh the only thing in the name that’s right is you will Pay because they are definitely not your Pal.!

And After what I’ve been put through by this unprofessional time consuming uncaring company im lucky I still have my sanity and my hair..\nI did although learn a thing or two and I did come to two very important conclusions! my first conclusion/lesson after being dragged through their jump through hoops, wait 48hrs for replies, only to get generic answers, then try to message again only to reach the end of explaining “AGAIN” what happened only to be taken back to log in and start again tactics! I Realised/learned that if I was a scammer I would be elated with PayPals time consuming pathetic efforts to help their customers as it gives me (the scammer) time to disappear with your money! then there’s the fact they don’t check sellers names, fake emails that end in numbers or even link a name on an account that money is paid into to the all the different websites that coincidentally share the same pay name but 10 different store names! Not cause for alarm? No it’s not says PayPal! I typed in my scammers pay name on simple ole google I couldn’t get much info on the website name as it was only 6mths old plus it disappeared less than 24hrs after my purchase but the account pay name? well that was a hit on google, so popular in fact, it had made headlines on all the scam watch pages, even a mention in the Pennsylvania news! But that was not enough for PayPal to get my money back for me! they dont care about me and they don’t care to take extra precautions like checking out scam pages or having an alert system to warn them that they may potentialIy have a scammer in the midst!! I mean with that kind of out of date system it’s a scammers Paradise... if I was a scammer PayPal would be my wonderland and the greatest platform for me to showcase my scammer skills!! My other conclusion? Why the hell was I using PayPal when the only reason I did was because I was under the impression they were safe and that the customers were protected! Turns out I was delusional and PayPal is a vortex to hell where the scammer is protected and safe.. just read their community page you might just be sick.! My scammer ripped off people during the height of the COVID-19 Toilet papergate and a tonne of others were ripped off buying something off their “website” that either didn’t come or was significantly different from what they bought like ordered a Mustang got a rubber ducky different! Now why I say you might be sick? Well they are still a PayPal legitimate seller with the same pay name as the COVID19 scam company just a different website name and that’s only 1 of about 10 they have... so good luck dodging them and if you’re scammed by them good luck getting your money back without a damn good fight from ScamAssist I mean PayPal... minus 5 stars and I wish I could kick PayPal in the “trust pilot won’t let me write it” but you know where!', 'review_date': '2020-08-16', 'review_time': '20:09:26', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
