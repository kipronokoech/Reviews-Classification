On 25th September I paid the balance as a one off payment from my bank account registered with Paypal. Although the money was taken from my account on 26th September it still shows, (2nd October) as pending. After eventually getting through to them on the phone, they said that as it was an e-cheque payment it wouldn't clear until 9th October, so still waiting. It didn't say when I was making the payment that it would take 10 working days and neither did it say that it would be an e-cheque. Just about every other company, the transfer is immediate or within 24 hours. Customer services are very poor, their response was as below:\n\nThank you for contacting PayPal and for being a part of our community for 18 years! My name is Rossetti. I understand how important it is for you to know why the payment is pending. Upon checking, the amount of £58.32 was paid using an echeque and this will take 7-10 business days to clear. To provide one of the safest online payment services our internal security system reviews every payment before it's approved. Occasionally, we only allow a payment to be sent as an eCheque. It's not a reflection of you or your account activities, but rather we've noticed a pattern associated with higher-than-normal risk.\n\nWhat pattern? I have been a member for 18 years and always paid by direct debit, so what pattern is there to a single payment to clear my account? It seems that the modern way with Paypal is to treat customers with contempt.", 'review_date': '2020-10-02', 'review_time': '13:52:43', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

All seemed well as I received an email confirmation shortly after the purchase and later a tracking number. Although alarmed by the Chinese tracking number - I figured that I would let it ride through and see what happened. After the usual 2 plus months of checking the status of the shipment from China - I finally was surprised to see that the shipment was on it's way. When my package arrived - it dawned on me that when I saw the cheap, substitute merchandise that I received instead of what I had ordered - I knew that I had been scammed and shame on me. I immediately contacted PayPal and started a claim on the purchase and was asked to tell my side of the story in detail. PayPal advised that they would contact the seller. The Chinese seller replied back to PayPal that I had indeed ordered from them - but that I actually ordered the cheap junk that they sent me and that I had gotten what I ordered - which was dead wrong. When advised of the seller comments - I immediately contacted PayPal by phone (which consisted of waiting in line for over 45 minutes) and when I finally reached a PayPal rep - I was told simply that the case was under review and no further assistance could be offered at this time. I waited at this point - figuring that PayPal would refund my purchase price after figuring out that this was obviously a scam seller and all would be well. I then received a notification from PayPal that I would be required to return the merchandise to the seller in China - that I would be required to pay the return shipping and that I would need to enter the tracking information in the resolution center by October 8, 2020 or my case would be automatically closed and I would not be issued a refund. I again contacted PayPal and after waiting the approximate 45 minutes listening to the endless recorded messages. This time the PayPal rep told me that they would email the seller - but if no response was received - I would still need to return the merchandise at my cost and enter the tracking number or forfeit the case. PayPal would not send me an email confirmation of this conversation for my records as well. I did receive a follow-up message notification from PayPal - after I had no alternative but to message PayPal - this message reintegrated the original PayPal contact that they were only responsible for refunding the purchase price and that they recommended that I contact the seller for a prepaid shipping label to return the cheap substituted merchandise which wasn't worth returning at any cost. I replied to PayPal that I had little chance - if any - of getting any response from a Chinese scammer for a return label before the end of time and certainly not before October 8, 2020 so that I could enter a tracking number to preserve my active status of my case. The whole point here is that my experience with PayPal is that they are not interested in protecting the buyer who obviously made a bad purchase and they could care less about any buyer protection whatsoever in respect to the business they generate with these fraudulent sellers. I have made it very clear to PayPal that this will have been my last purchase using PayPal and that I have already contacted my credit card company to file a dispute with PayPal for this practice. I have spoken to our credit card company, started a claim and uploaded any and all documentation on this purchase. I am reviewing my experience with PayPal here for the benefit of others who may want to think twice about using PayPal thinking that they will have any buyer protection in cases such as mine. I freely admit that the purchase mistake was mine and lesson learned - but I have also learned that PayPal is not a trustworthy company and that they have probably the worst customer service department that I have ever contacted.", 'review_date': '2020-10-02', 'review_time': '12:30:18', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
