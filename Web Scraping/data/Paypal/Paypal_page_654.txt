I ordered a piece of furniture and paid with paypal because I assumed with their buyers protection it was a safe form of payment. The item I received was a necklace. I spent way too many hours on the phone and e-mailing paypal to resolve this. Ultimately paypal said they would refund me but only if I sent the necklace back, the cost of shipping the necklace back with a tracking number paypal required was $50, and IF (thats a big if) paypal decided to reimburse me it would be a max of $30.\nDuring my multiple conversations with paypal I have determined they facilitate sellers who scam. They verified that no matter what someone orders a seller can ship whatever they want as long as they provide a valid tracking number. And then once you realize you got a completely different item YOU the buyer are now responsible to return the item you didn\'t want if you ever want to see your money again for the item you actually ordered but didn\'t get. They explained the buyer is responsible for shipping back the item because they seller had to provide materials to ship, and it cost them gas etc. so the seller shouldn\'t be responsible for return shipping because they were already responsible to ship it the first time. I also had someone tell me "it\'s like when you go to target and they leave the security tag on, you are responsible for the costs to go back and get the tags taken off. that\'s why you have to pay return shipping" Not the same thing at all.
