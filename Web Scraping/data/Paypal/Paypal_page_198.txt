Support useless, as they cant release money (so why to heck they needed there at all?). So i HIGHLY RECOMMEND NOT USE PAYPAL AT ALL to any Business Owner that provides any kind of service. As small business i cant afford my money sitting on hold for 21 days, and even with confirmation that they asking its different timelines that not even exact... poor platform for money", 'review_date': '2022-06-02', 'review_time': '06:01:48', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

We needed a way to accept credit cards for our business and had a PayPal account, they boasted all these great things you can do with a PayPal business account so we signed up.

We provided tracking that shows it was delivered and accepted and did everything PayPal said we needed to do to release the payment and it\'s still "Pending". This is the worst experience I\'ve ever had with any company and will be cancelling it if and when this payment becomes available. We are a growing business and expect many more large transactions and after this experience WILL NOT be using PayPal from here on out.

I phoned them and explained that I could not return something I did not receive and provided again the tracking number showing the order was redelivered to the seller, rather than to my address. A week later, they emailed me stating the seller has proven the item was delivered by giving them a new tracking number that showed that an item was delivered to the same locker, but obviously that wasn\'t mine. I have explained to them the tracking number did not match the one in my order, but they insisted that, as an item was delivered to that address, I have definitely received it and therefore closed the case in favour of the seller. They told me to complain to the delivery company if I did not receive the item. Really? So I have been scammed by a seller who posted something to their own address, then sent another order to the same locker (to which I cannot access without the shipment code), and they failed to refund me?
