We have only had one compliant filed and tis was for a $30 tshirt that arrived to our customer late. Paypal is putting our company in jeopardy with no explanation and zero communication. They ignore all emails and managers tell me that they cannot tell me what is going on, and they themselves cannot contact the "back office" for answers. Shortly after they froze our account we switched to Square and everything was great there. Please DO NOT USE PAYPAL if you are a business owner.

However all they said was that "Paypal would like to apologise for any inconvenience caused when attempting to log into your PayPal account" which is similar to an apology for a late running train! Paypal also decided to deny the facts and claim that I had been able to access my account all along; effectively accusing my of lying! The mistake I made was not keeping a detailed log of all the live chat and telephone conversations which is difficult to prove years later. This is the worst company I have ever had to deal with as they never reply to your requests and cannot resolve anything.
