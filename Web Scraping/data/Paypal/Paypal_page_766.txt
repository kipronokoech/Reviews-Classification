There is usually someone lurking about on forums or review sites waiting to quote the small print and agreements that people enter in to when they deal with PayPal so to those people in advance I’ll say don’t bother, this isn’t a forum for you to read word for word the user agreement...the pertinent fact here is that for a lengthy period of time PayPal was forced upon people who wished to use eBay! They charge an inordinate fee, as do eBay! And they hold people’s money while masquerading as an advocate for ensuring “credible selling”. The customer service is an absolute farce, you send an email and it’s met with a copy and paste, automated rehash of information you’ve read through while trying to open the email facility and then it has the temerity at the end to invite you to reply to the email if it “hasn’t answered your question”, fair enough unlike eBay (who getting in touch with is like sticking your head out of a crowded bus and shouting the name of an acquaintance as it races along the road) you do get connected to a human being at PayPal but they’re no use really. I feel sympathy for them having to uphold this utterly ridiculous and ill informed set of practices but when you try to explain to them that you have dispatched an item, uploaded the tracking, have a flawless transaction history and have taken all the risks really...they seem completely unable to conceptualise why it is you’re out of sorts and ringing them. They reiterate that your money will be available 3,000 years after the last of your ancestors has perished in a Cyborg War on Planet Eart IV and that they’ll “email the buyer to confirm delivery”, they continue to say “as a businessman...” well I am not a businessman, I am not a businessman and my simple £119.11 may not break the bank for a global enterprise like eBay or PayPal, but that £119.11 was for an item that a very dear friend of mine wanted to sell on eBay...someone not altogether computer literate, someone who’s had a rough time of late and needed a bit of quick cash to keep the wolves from the door. Someone that was optimistic and given back his smile when he knew the item had sold on eBay...5 days later I’ve given him the money. Because I can’t bare the thought of someone being made to wait while the most outrageous process in the world takes place with PayPal pretending to be a bank. When I was little I used to play Monopoly and I was always amazed at the banker, my cousin was always the banker and he would count the money he handed out twice as if it was real, as if it was his ha ha.
