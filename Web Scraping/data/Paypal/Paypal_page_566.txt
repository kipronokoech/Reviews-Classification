It transpired the first line of my address was being left off at each Paypal transaction. (The address in my account profile has not changed.) After a week of ‘messaging’, I lodged a formal complaint with Paypal & spoke to someone who finally accepted the problem was at their end. This decision was rescinded the next day by Customer Services and Paypal determined the companies involved had to reimburse me. I complained again and was then told ‘gift addresses’ for previous transactions existed in my account which were incorrect, and were now being used as the default address for current purchases. I have NEVER set up a ‘gift address’. I traced the problem to an online Click and Collect instore order where my home address was incorrectly transposed and it is that address which Paypal has used as the default in subsequent transactions, not the one in my account profile. I am very upset that Paypal refuses to reimburse the companies who have had to refund me through no fault of their own; the fault lies with Paypal.', 'review_date': '2020-07-01', 'review_time': '08:39:02', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
