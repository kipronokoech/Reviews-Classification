Last year I was hacked through PayPal so my card had been hacked and the hackers managed to do this through PayPal, it had been hacked over 10 times in a very suspicious way, the location of the transactions were odd but also the timing of the transactions, it took up to 10 times for me to be hacked before paypal decided to send me a security alert. Over £200 had been stolen, I’m a student so £200 to me is an insane amount of money, I had the biggest panic of my life and tried to ring paypal probably over 50 times, every single time I would be “put through to an adviser” however every time I was put through the phone would cut off, I then tried to contact them via the PayPal app on the chat, which was beyond unhelpful and absolutely did nothing, transactions were still being taken out of my account at this point so it was literally a race against time to stop more of my money being stolen. I then contacted my bank which of course were so helpful and cancelled my card etc. I honestly think if it was my card that had been hacked I never ever would have got my money back which would have been completely detrimental to me. PayPal then (after being contacted by my bank) decided to “block” my account, which is what should of been done initially, I still to this day am still blocked on my own PayPal even after sending off the right proof of identification, a year on I still am owed £30 by PayPal which I cannot withdraw apparently because my account has been blocked, the response on email is non existent and the replies on other socials is absolutely appalling I’m still waiting for a response now, a year on. Not only to add to this I recently sold an item on Depop which meant I had to use PayPal as Depop only associate with PayPal, for some reason. The person I sold the item to had received the item over a week ago now but my money is still “on hold” on PayPal and now my new account for PayPal has been blocked yet again! PayPal are genuine scammers and I cannot understand how they are such a large company. Please if you are a business owner take your business else where I would hate for anyone to be scammed thousands and thousands of pounds from this vile company. I hope PayPal respond to this, but from looking at the rest of the reviews and judging by the response time on social media and email that will be extremely unlikely.', 'review_date': '2021-05-04', 'review_time': '20:59:28', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

Most of my sales have been 200$ + or at the very least 100$+. I’ve been given various reasons non of which make sense, and after two days of calls, I was given my money, and a voucher only to have another 170$ held the following night. I need my funds to purchase new products, and get them listed and sold, if this is how they are going to do business going forward, they can count me out. The customer service agent answering the phone(after a 45 min. wait) has no superior? what kind of call center is this? I’ve actually set up call centers, and it’s scary to think that PayPal has one person supposedly calling all the shots handling all my money from sales as well as yours. I had no issues and still have 100% feedback on all platforms, but these guys answering the phones think they are where the buck stops. That’s what they don’t get, I have the option to not use PayPal, and after this experience, I can promise you, it’s not worth the hassle. I see people selling 10k plus items, what happens when these sale. When I have zero negative feedback, no complaints to PayPal and each person I speak with says something completely different, it’s scary. I wouldn’t give anyone $500 and let them say, “draw a card, and what’s on this card will be where and when you will get your money back, but your product has already shipped to buyer”. I have two college degrees and PayPal seems to be cutting corners, seriously, aiming at cutting costs, BAD IDEA! I’ve always said, customer service should always be the first and most important aspect of all operations, maybe after the product functionality, but if you follow my train of thought, a good product is only as good as the people that represent it. If my recent dealings with PayPal are any clue as to how the company is doing or the direction they are headed, I’d get out now! EBay is dropping PayPal and moving towards their own system which is scary as well, but I have more faith than I do in PayPal. Too bad it’s illegal to record phone calls without consent, because these were a mix of SNL and what not to do or how to lose customers the fast way!
