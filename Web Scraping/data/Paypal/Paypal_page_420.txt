This item was from my personal collection from years ago so I dont have a receipt. I contacted paypal and they said it was to help me with my business model. I informed them I'm just some get selling a few personal belongings not a businessperson buying and reselling stuff for a living.\n\nI dont do much business with paypal so at this point I just want my account closed and my bank account and debit card info removed from their system. I dont owe them any money and I dont wish to do business with them anymore, just close my account. I spoke with customer service and they told me I had to provide a receipt in order to resolve the restriction and then use or close my account. I spoke to supervisor Marty and she said the same thing. She said she could tell her resolution team that I didn't have a receipt and they SHOULD be able to remove that requirement and I would just need to send a photo I.d. (again, no idea why I need to do this if I dont want to use their services any longer but whatever). She said if they refused to accept the fact that I dont have a receipt that I will not be able to use the account OR close the account. It will just remain permanently locked but that I would not be able to close or remove my bank information.\n\nThis is ridiculous. I want my account closed. I want my banking information removed from their system, not locked where one of the thousands of hackers I read about every day can get to it.", 'review_date': '2021-01-05', 'review_time': '23:34:23', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
