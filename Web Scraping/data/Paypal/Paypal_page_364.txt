I can't remove ANY personal information including my SSN so i can get hacked again, EVEN THOUGH PayPal locked my account for absolutely no reason. I can't close my account because it's now locked. They claimed there were no agents available because it isn't business hours. It's 3pm. This is the absolute worst program to use. Use anything else but this one. Negative stars if i could.

Since becoming a member about 3 years ago, I have been the victim of collection scams directly related to PayPal on two occasions. I have never had a balance over $150 and always paid the full balance within a few days and more frequently within hours of the debt. However, these scammers were able to obtain information via PayPal that allows them to harass me with demand letters for amounts of $317 and $222 coupled with threats. Having been an Amazon customer for nearly 10 years I have never experienced anything of the sort PayPal allowed. Given this unrelenting scam effort, I closed the PayPal account with a warning to other customers, be careful.', 'review_date': '2021-03-25', 'review_time': '01:17:23', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

I used PayPal to receive money from selling an item on Swappa. I attached a tracking number on PayPal, but they still put my money on hold. A few days later, they tell me I need to provide further information about myself even though the person I sold the item to confirmed their receipt of the item. Even after I provided all of the necessary information, they continued to hold my money for another 2 weeks. Finally, it said the money was ready to be transferred. I go to transfer it to my bank, OPTING OUT OF giving them 1% and just waiting 3 business days.... OF COURSE there was an “error” when trying to find my bank. Only when I opted into the expedited transfer that gave them 1% did it actually let me confirm the transfer. OH, but no. After confirming the transfer, there was ANOTHER error saying it will STILL take 72 hours for them to REVIEW my transfer! The error message said I won’t be charged the 1%, but I bet they will charge me anyways.\n\nTheir customer support is absolute garbage. You will wait on hold for an eternity before getting anyone on the line and that person will simply hang up on you if you’re situation gets too difficult for them to handle. Oh, and never try the “call back” feature. They won’t call you back.\n\nI don’t understand how this company remains to be a company. Just simply googling “PayPal has my money on hold” will pull up thousands of people who are going through this right now.
