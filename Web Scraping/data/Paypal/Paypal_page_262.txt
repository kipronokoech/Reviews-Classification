A friends and family transaction that went horribly wrong left me without the money for about a month (so far, because I still don\'t have it). Every time I called I was given false information. I tried everything they told me to try. This is absolutely ridiculous. I have realized their customer service team doesn\'t actually know what they are talking about. Every new person I talk to tells me the last person was misinformed and gives me more incorrect information or a few things I have found out to be flat out lies. Even when a transaction email states it would be 1 more business day before I finally received the money that I have been waiting weeks for, I was told after calling this was an incorrect email and it would be 3-5 business days. Approaching that date and without even a pending transaction on my account I call and was informed it would be AT LEAST 5 business days. This is after multiple weeks of calls to find out why so many holds were placed on my transaction. Even following their guidance of a "21 day hold for MY safety" I found the money still wasn\'t available to even transfer into my account until calling and complaining after 24 days of waiting. I don\'t know how a company can continuously hold money from people even when it goes against their maximum hold policies. On top of that all of the fees I encountered for a transaction I was assured would be free when I originally called to ask about it is enough to make me permanently delete this app and site from my life altogether. I have never wasted so much time and energy to only continuously be lied to, charged fees, and have my money held even when following 100% of the protocol I was told to follow. The customer service on multiple occasions told me I did everything correctly and then made another excuse as to why my money was still being withheld, or giving me a hopeless trail of lies to follow. I also have another issue. Since then I have had two breaches in my bank account and had to go through hell to re-secure my checking account. Since the first one was 2 days after adding bank account information to PayPal and I have never had any issues like this before, I am highly suspicious of their security and as soon as the money is in my account I am going to remove all of my information from them and delete my PayPal. I do not recommend using them, even as a last resort.

I talked to the card company and they say everything is fine and that PayPal must have the issues with it. PayPal customer service was no help at all resolving the issue!! All if the agents barely speak English and don't seem to understand the problem. All they say is it must be a glitch! Well duh!!!!
