I ran into a relatively minor issue trying to add a credit card. It shouldn't have been that big a deal. Four times they told me they fixed it. Four times they didn't. Every time, they made me start the complaint process over, including asking for the last four digits of my credit card about twenty times. This is infuriating. I can only imagine how people feel after their accounts are frozen for no good reason. I had no idea this was such a widespread problem.\n\nThe fact they've been unable to fix my minor issue (which started in July) was what first made me leery of them. They shouldn't need almost two months to fix an issue with adding a credit card. If they can't fix something so simple, they can't be trusted with my money.\n\nI foresaw the end coming, so a few weeks ago, I re-routed all my PayPal automatic payments through my credit card. During this process, I discovered I'd been overpaying some of the companies, so I guess I'm at least a little glad PayPal has terrible customer service. I won't be hemorrhaging as much money now that I've streamlined my automatic payments.\n\nAfter giving PayPal one more chance to fix the problem, I closed my account today. The low scores on Trustpilot and horror stories from sellers who had their accounts frozen were pretty much the coup de grace. I don't want to be a part of causing such misery. Again, I had no idea it was such a common problem or I would have got rid of them sooner.\n\nIn fact, I feel a bit guilty for not closing my account a long time ago after PayPal froze funds meant for a cancer patient. We only knew each other a little bit, but I still gave what I could. Maybe he would have died anyway, but PayPal's freezing of raised funds meant having to postpone a life-saving surgery. He died from complications that arose due to the postponement of the surgery, so at the very least, he might have lived longer had PayPal not frozen those funds. At the time, I mostly blamed his political enemies for contacting PayPal and giving spurious information. This was the main reason, but PayPal was complicit, too.\n\nI'm not sure how to pay eBay vendors and small businesses going forward. I suppose it's Google time.", 'review_date': '2019-09-07', 'review_time': '18:42:14', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
