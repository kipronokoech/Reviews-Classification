The rate at which they are holding people's money is terrible! Its too sad that even merchants are now undergoing PayPal's frustrations. I don't understand why someone should pay a merchant via PayPal and the money get held. The reason: You’ll get your money within 7 days of verification. Another observation is that some accounts are seriously monitored. The big bro, PayPal must ask what you are paying for? Whoever I am sending money to is my own concern (strictly between me, the buyer and the sender), we know where we got each other. Why should they frustrate the customers? Let them continue with the holding technique of stealing from people, but soon it will end up a failing company.
