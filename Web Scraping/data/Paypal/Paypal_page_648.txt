The order then arrived at my door WEEKS after Christmas, which was the point of the order originally.\n\nI received the item, but I can't get a refund. They are telling me this is buyers' remorse, even though I tried to cancel the order prior to it shipping. The product that arrived is smaller and cheaper looking than described on the website. Additionally, they were way overcharging for the item. You can get the same thing on Amazon for less than a quarter of the price I paid.\n\nI will never use PayPal again.", 'review_date': '2020-02-11', 'review_time': '14:57:01', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

Later, I ran into an issue where I needed to exchange and item in store. I was told that there would be no way for them to reach Paypal to give a refund. The cashier then suggested getting a Paypal card and I could transfer funds when I'm ready to purchase something, and use it as a debit card, still being secure. I have tried to purchase 2 items since. The transfers takes TOO LONG! I wanted to purchase a Valentine's Day gift and transferred the money on Friday (2/1) and today is Tuesday (2/11). That's over a week! My bank has already cleared it and shows it being cleared on 2/7. This will probably be the last time I use Paypal.

Unethical and lacking integrity\n\nI think a more apt name for the service would be "ScrewYouPal" because that\'s exactly what they will do sooner or later\n\nPaypal have destroyed many peoples lives and business\n\nAnyone that has been with PayPal long enough will know that this company is highly unpredictable, with account freezes,account closures, placing funds on hold, refusal to answer email etc. They engage in unfair business practice which often borders on criminal.\n\nEssentially PayPal ignore laws designed for consumer protection which are strongly enforced against ordinary financial institutions.\n\nIt it were not for Paypal\'s monopolistic control over Ebay they would almost certainly be out of business\n\nThere are many good alternatives available, for example Stripe. Although a European service, it can, with a bit of ingenuity, be used worldwide\n\nAny reviews listed here that give any more than one star will over the course of time realize that their trust has been misplaced\n\nFor those that have suffered the injustice of PayPal\'s criminal actions I would have suggested joining a class action lawsuit but PayPal have added a clause to their T&C\'s preventing such action with the excuse that it encourages swift and reasonable resolution as opposed to litigation. Tell that to the many thousands that have funds frozen for 180 days and PayPal refusing to answer any correspondence\n\nThis can only be described as abusive practice through legal channels and pretty much sums up PayPal\n\nBe warned you absolutely cannot trust Paypal and you will get burned, guaranteed !!', 'review_date': '2020-02-10', 'review_time': '15:07:55', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

They declined my claim, saying I\'d not provided sufficient proof / tracking I returned the goods.Yet, the same proof was sufficient for a different part of Paypal to refund me the shipping costs (return on us).
