The only payment media accepted was PayPal. I contacted the seller a few times because I had not received anything and when clicking on the tracking number, I was directed to a site that says, "Sorry, this shop is currently unavailable". On June 10th, 2021, I filed a dispute with PayPal. On June 23rd, I did receive a package from ByforOne with the tracking number referenced; however, in the less than one pound package, there were two 3-in-1 USB Cables, whatever those are. I updated PayPal and the seller with pictures attached. I never heard anything from either. On July 1st, 2021, my dispute with PayPal was denied as the seller supposedly supplied a tracking number that was delivered. Well, no kidding. I had already told them that. I tried to get help via chat and I was never answered. Any company that is (sadly) foreign that will only take PayPal might very well be a scam and what is unfortunately, mostly, is that I believe PayPal is in on it......and the end user customer (in this case, I) gets scammed out of money. Shame on you, PayPal. I have since canceled my account.', 'review_date': '2021-07-13', 'review_time': '15:09:50', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

They continued to say they will release my funds on 04 Jan 2021. This is extremely odd as my account was restricted on 08 July 2021, meaning they would make my monies available 7 months in the past.... Shocked is an understatement. After responding to the email informing them of their grave error, I received an email basically saying "Sorry, you cant appeal. Bye". Hideous service by a company ranked as 134th biggest on the planet.\n\nI then thought I would phone to see if I could talk to a human about my issue. I called all of the numbers listed on the contact us page and they all rang unobtainable. 3 numbers, none would connect. I come to find out you have to call them from a landline. A landline. Its 2021 and PayPal still thinks people don\'t use mobile phones. I finally find a number, that isn\'t free phone I might add, that connects and talk to a C/S advisor. To the advisors credit, they were helpful. They said they would pass my case to the relevant team and promised a response with in 72 hours. Progress, I thought....\n\n72 hrs on, I receive an email saying "Sorry, we cant help. Bye"\n\nI\'m now left out of pocket and I can\'t use use a service I have relied on to pay and receive money for many years. I also cant set up another account as they have blocked my card and bank account.\n\nHow a company this size gets away with such practices is quite frankly ludicrous. The stress and inconvenience they put people under is unacceptable.\n\nBy the reviews on here and around all internet review platforms, I see I am not the only one suffering from the wrath of this tyrant company. I\'m sure I wont be the last.\n\n*UPDATE* After this debacle, tonight I receive an email invitation to sign up to PayPal credit. This situation gets more comical by the day.
