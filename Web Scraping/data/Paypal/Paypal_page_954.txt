I waited in all afternoon and i never got a call back, and when i phoned them back they said they didn't have any record on their system of my first call and the call back i was supposed to receive.", 'review_date': '2012-01-02', 'review_time': '14:38:29', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

I was moving money from Euros to Krona and they froze my money due to "suspicious activities". My activities probably did look somewhat suspicious due to a sequence of events leading up to the transfer of funds.\n\nI managed to get it unfrozen, but not without a whole lot of paper work and run around. Paypal wanted to charge 7% of the sum to transfer the fees PLUS a really awful currency exchange rate. I would have lost hundreds of Euros in fees if the transaction went though!\n\nBottom line, don\'t use PayPal for currency transfers. They charge outrageous fees and have lousy exchange rates.', 'review_date': '2012-01-01', 'review_time': '15:37:20', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
