I provided eBay with all the information I had, to prove the buyer was lying (message correspondence mainly, where the buyer basically admitted to changing his mind about the shirt). EBay then closed the case, and I "won" the claim.\n\nThe claim was then escalated to PayPal, and even though I submitted the same evidence, Paypal told me that the buyer was entitled to a full refund once the item had been returned to me. However I was assured by PayPal that I wouldn\'t need to refund unless the shirt was in the exact same condition that I sold it. I received the shirt a week later, stained with a strong smell attached to it. I called PayPal to explain the situation and I was told that the buyer was still entitled to a FULL refund, as I\'d received it back. So they initially lied to me when they said I didn\'t have to refund unless the item was in the same condition. The insanity of this whole situation was starting to really get to me now.\n\nI then escalated the claim with photo evidence of the damage, and the case was closed a week later with no explanation of what the resolution was. I called PayPal and they told me that they would be giving me some "credit" back, but needed 72 hours to process it. Apparently I\'d not received any money because they credited the wrong account (so the buyer was not only refunded by me, but got additional money from PayPal that was meant to be sent to my account).\n\nIn the end, they did refund me the full amount back.
