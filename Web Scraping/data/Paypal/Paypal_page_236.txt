I can't see it on the mobile app and I know from experience that trying to first find a phone number and then getting anything out of a call with PayPal is pointless. I looked for an email address and found one (but it was very hard to locate). I emailed support and they have replied firstly asking what I wanted (when I had described it on the email) then telling me customer service had resolved it (when they hadn't), then telling me I had to contact a different department (why can't they forward the query internally?) and gave me a link to fill in the query (which is exactly the same place I filled in my initial query anyway). I have had experience of trying to deal with PayPal before and their service is shockingly bad. My advice is if you can do without PayPal (or use some other method) then do so.", 'review_date': '2022-01-14', 'review_time': '12:29:10', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

This was done on the 8th December, I provided tracking number, a photo of my Royal Mail receipt and expected my money refunded shortly. After no response and constantly chasing up the disputes department, they closed my case on the in companies favour, stating I had not provided tracking for the item? Then called and spoke to disputes who said what they had done was incorrect and the item just had not been delivered yet ( itâ€™s in transit, but clearly lost), they would reopen and continue. This was obviously not done and then speaking to a woman called Pooja, on the customer service chat asked me how to use tracking number. They still refuse to do anything to help apart from say they could possibly send a courtesy message the company and see what they say but apart from that itâ€™s my problem. I am somehow liable, Iâ€™m pretty sure that having received and proven the items are faulty PP should be doing more from my side?', 'review_date': '2022-01-14', 'review_time': '09:17:17', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
