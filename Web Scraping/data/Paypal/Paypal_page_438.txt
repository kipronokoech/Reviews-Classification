They prey on small business owners (especially during a pandemic) for their own corporate benefit. Paypal 'helps' small business owners collect fees for the products and services. However, Paypal, at any point, can decide to claim those funds (without any legislation) and never send them to the business owner.\n\nYes, thats right. Paypal essentially steals the money of Registered and Legal Small business owners.\n\nNext time you think about using PayPal...just remembered that any money spent does NOT go to the rightful business owner or service provider. Paypal, in many cases, ceases the money and claims it as their own, effectively stealing it from the business.\n\nIf you hesitate to believe this, just have one look at Paypal's Better Business Bureau, Reddit or any other online forum.", 'review_date': '2020-12-10', 'review_time': '05:10:30', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

Stupidly I did as all the PayPal advisors I spoke to said it is the only way to get my money back. On checking the courier detail, it was delivered back. PayPal then closed the case in favour of the scammers, firstly citing I put an incorrect delivery address (it was the one they gave me as I cut and pasted it) only to then change their story and said they could not see the delivery detail on the Hermes tracking (when it clearly stated it was delivered).

Unfortunately, they don't care about anyone, buyer or seller. Money on hold for no reason after years of solid custom with no issues. I've been a PayPal customer for years and have had many issues with them, but this is the last straw. I am a small business that sold an item to a customer on another continent. This payment is on hold for reasons that are absolutely nonsensical - my business standing is excellent, and my PayPal record for both buying and selling is flawless. When I called to dispute/enquire further, they told me the hold was 'standard procedure'. How, if this has never happened before in seven years of me using this service? It's not the amount, because it's never been an issue before. According to their ludicrous terms, they will release my payment only if I provide tracking details, and even then it will still take at least two weeks for my money. Meaning, they expect me to send the item before they release the money - to send a product worth $3000 to Australia, with no guarantees of it being safely received and of course I don't know the recipient (a customer I have never met), they could tell me it's damaged or concoct a lie at their end and then I will never see my money, and I will have lost my merchandise. Would you take that risk, as a small business? I can't afford to and I think most sane proprietors would agree with me. YOU DO NOT EVER, EVER, SEND AN ITEM WITHOUT BEING PAID FOR IT FIRST. That is the way that shopping works. We exchange money for goods and services. No money, no goods.
