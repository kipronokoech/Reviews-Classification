BE AWARE!!!\n\nI have been using PayPal for years, and I have NEVER had problems with my account. On the contrary, I\'ve always found it to be extremely handy.\nBut from October to now, I have been living in a CONSTANT NIGHTMARE. PayPal has been harassing me, threatening me, the employees I spoke to, said they would help resolve the situation and only made it worse. I have a serious health problem and it has now been aggravated because of the way I have been treated by PayPal!!\nI started my pay in 3 in August 2022 and I have been making all regular payments. I submitted the all 3 payments without issues.\n\nHowever, after I submitted my last instalments on the 30/10, I received an email stating that my payment for September FAILED and my account was in arrears.\nI went to my PayPal account and there was nothing to suggest that my payment had failed. Actually, it said that the payment was RECEIVED (the 24/09) even before my due date on the 30/10, as I personally made the payment.\n\nSince the day - after having submitted the last payment on the 30/10, I then started to be harassed by PayPal. I have been receiving calls, during my working hours - they call me and tell me that I need to provide my details to verify my account; I have been threatened that if I don\'t process a "payment immediately, we will make it harder for me to get a future credit"; they have demanded that I submit a payment immediately, as I have not paid.\nOn the 25/11 I decided to call my bank and find out what was going on. I called my bank and explained to them what had happened. My bank looked through my account and stated the "money has DEFINEETLY been REVEIVED by PayPal. It has gone through, there is no record of them sending the money back". As I expected.\n\nI then called PayPal, and on that day, I spoke to more than 5 employees regarding this issue.\nThey were transferring me to one person to the other, giving me false information:\n1. One person told me that the money was not received;\n2. another person told me that the payment was not proceed because ¬£0.01 was missing;\n3. Another person told me that the money was refunded;\n4. Another told me that I requested the money back because I did not receive the item;\n5. Another told me that my bank opened a dispute and that it has been favourable to me.\n6. I was also asked "how many more credits I am struggling to pay". When I asked the gentleman what he meant by that, he said that I sound like someone who does not fulfils their payment, on time.\n\nI felt so embarrassed, ashamed and discriminated by what he said. I even cried later that day and till today, my eyes start to tear up when I remember what he said and how he said it.\nAs you can see, the employees cannot seem to agree or know what is going on. And when I asked them questions, I was called rude and the phone mysteriously "hangs off".\n\nOn the same day I spoke to a lady (person n6) who spent her time trying to explain to me what (supposing) is going on.\n\nThe lady told me that bank opened a dispute, on my behalf on the 12/10. I explained to the lady that I NEVER asked or even consented for my bank to open a dispute, as I have proof that I received the product and I am using it.\nI also explained that I can send her proof that I received the item; nonetheless, why would my bank open a dispute and I proceed the last payment on the 30/10?!\nIT DOES NOT MAKE SENSE!!!\nAt this point, I asked her if she could send me my information, as this is new to me and she refused claiming that emails have already been sent out.\n\nThe lady then suggested that I call my bank so we can be on a 3-way call "and she can provide them with detailed information".\nI called the bank and again, they confirmed that THEY HAVE NO EVIDENCE OF A DISPUTE BEING OPENED, AT ALL!!\nThe bank told me and the lady that the payments have been proceed and nothing has been refunded.\n\nThe bank even gave me the following details:\nPayment Authorisation Code: 034856\nPayment Authorisation Ref number: 0226712352520\n\nThe lady then sent me an email claiming that that was/is the dispute they received from my bank.\n\nI was shocked when I saw it!!! It is literally an email that, even I can write. It does not have my bank\'s detail/logo or even my name/address. It just has my PayPal account email and the amount that is being requested back.\nWhat even shocked me more is that the amount in "dispute" is SUPERIOR to the original charge\n... by like ¬£100.\n\nI asked the lady how could they be so unprofessional and naive???\n\nHow can someone dispute a charge and request more money than what they actually paid???
