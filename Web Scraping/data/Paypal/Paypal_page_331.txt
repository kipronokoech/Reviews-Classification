However, my opinion has changed slightly.\n\nBack in 2015, PayPal decided to suddenly & permanently 'limit' my account, keeping Â£50! I was obviously upset & outraged as I'd done nothing wrong to warrant such action. At the beginning of this month they temporarily limited my account pending relevant ID and proof of my business. My heart sank as I had over Â£900 in the account this time.......which was all the money I had! I am SO relieved to say that after only one week and a few sent documents, I could access & withdraw my funds. This I did NOT expect to happen. I had waved goodbye to all the money I had in the world at that point.\n\nI am surprised as anyone that I got my money back as I seriously didn't expect it to be that straightforward. Maybe I am just one of the lucky few who successfully win these limitations. Or maybe it's just a case of supplying them with what they ask you for to regain full control of your account. Idk. But what a relief!\n\nI'm awarding them 3 stars, as in the end, I got my money. But 3 stars is very generous considering they blatantly stole my Â£50. In any case, I won't be using them again. Fighting daft limitations just isn't worth it. Plus, I doubt I'll be lucky twice.
