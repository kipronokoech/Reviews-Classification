I\'ve contacted their customer service on each occasion and been told varying things that don\'t add up like the seller "didn\'t claim the funds withing 24hrs" which considering each seller was different and all said they\'d received the funds and dispatched the item kinda sounds unrealistic to be charitable or "they accidentally charged an old card" which I definitively didn\'t use during the transaction.\n\nThis doesn\'t happen to any of my family or friends so I\'m very frustrated that it just keeps happening to me and then I basically just get told that it\'s just going to keep happening for no real reason.\n\nIt\'ll definitely make me consider other similar services in future instead of doing it via paypal.

I provided Packlink with a package as per PayPal and Packlink delivery instructions and received tracking details from them. For several days nothing happened, then suddenly the package had been delivered. Yet, the recipient had not received anything so either the delivery driver had not delivered it, or they had stolen it. Upon contacting Packlink to report this they said they would try delivery again, very strange considering they had said it had already been delivered. I waited again for several days for this but was now updated that no one was home in the second attempt so it would be returned to me. Fair enough I thought, but I never received the parcel back despite them again saying it had been delivered. I do not wish to say their drivers are thieves but clearly something is going on for this. The most disappointing thing is that this is the first time I used Packlink after PayPal recommending them as a courier. PayPal have been just as useless and have now charged me an additional dispute fee due to Packlink inability to track and deliver a parcel.

I got hold of FedEx and rectified it and I then received the items ( 2 x very rare irreplaceable guitar necks) and both were broken and not as described.\nThe box was nearly paper thin and could be flattened using a hand and it had a massive hole in it and both necks were in pieces and had oxidation on the metal parts so not in new condition as the locking nuts would need replacing.\nI opened a claim and sent all the pictures of the box the the broken necks and the oxidisation to PayPal.\nThey said I had to return them to the seller even though they are broken?\nI refused as I dont have a suitable box or the means to return at present.\nThe seller is saying it\'s not her fault but I am saying it absolutely is if you cant put them in a sturdy box when being sent from the US to the UK and citing her previous feedback which is irrelevant as it\'s my experience I have an issue with not anyone else\'s, her lack of apology is just coming across as arrogant and evasive.\nIt\'s not about the money, I needed those parts and have had no choice but to spend £100 on titebond and clamps etc to try and fix them because they cant be found or purchased again anywhere.\nSo not only have I had a terrible buying experience but I have spent a further £100 and now have to mess around fixing the necks.\nPayPal have done absolutely nothing, they can see the evidence and I feel I should at least get something back.\nOf course they aren\'t available at weekends to talk to on the phone which is ridiculous, I work weekends and I dont get why a 24/7 transaction company does not have 24/7 agents available. I simply dont have any more time to waste explaining myself to another agent and also trying to do that just before I have to get out the door as PayPal are 8.00 am til 6pm or whatever.\nUPDATE:\nI have since received an email from PayPal saying they have reviewed the case and it\'s been resolved.\nOMG! They are a joke, I closed the case because the only option available was to return the broken guitar necks but due to their extreme rarity I decided to keep them and mend them, I messaged the seller asking for her to do the right thing and give a partial refund for the inconvenience, damage and cost to repair.\nShe is completely ignoring me. BEWARE, if you make a purchase using solely PayPal as they really are incompetent, useless and extremely unprofessional and you won\'t get any buyer protection unless you send the item back at your own expense which of course in some instances is not possible.\nI since emailed PayPal and made a complaint and all I got was an auto generated email telling me how "Seriously!" they take all complaints. My response was less than calm and I did lose it and tell them to remove their fingers from their backsides and do something but of course its PayPal so they wont.', 'review_date': '2023-03-08', 'review_time': '06:40:04', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
