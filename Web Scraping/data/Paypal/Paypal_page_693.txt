I informed PayPal that the seller ignored my messages and did not refund the payment for the service I am not using (Mondeo, language learning system). PayPal refused to refund the unauthorised payment. It would never happen with any of my banks. It was time to close the account (which they make difficult to do).

The vendor sent a different item that was 5 times the price of the item I ordered. The vendor did not respond to me emails so I raised a dispute in the PayPal Resolution web page. After describing my problem in detail, PayPal denied my case stating that I ordered an item that was similar to what was delivered so my complaint of "item received is not as described in my order" did not meet the criteria of "not as described" since the items are similar. I found out there is really no clear appeal process for their ruling since they closed my case as I wanted to protest. So I opened a new case of "purchases not authorized" and explained why their ruling was wrong. I explained in layman terms that my software order was like purchasing a hammer for $20 and the vendor delivered a toolbox full of different tools costing $100. I said all I wanted was a partial refund of $80. Again my new appeal case was denied because they said "there was no unauthorized purchase". Hell No - Paypal is wrong. Of course I never authorized the purchase of a toolbox full of different tools. It seemed to me Paypal never bothered to read my detailed explanation. I said to myself that if I used my long-time credit card I would have gotten the support against the shady vendor. PayPal is a huge disappointment and so I have closed my PayPal account.', 'review_date': '2019-11-10', 'review_time': '16:55:52', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

He says his products are from NJ and then weeks after you order they show up from China and are crappy knockoffs. I reported this to PayPal and wanted a refund and they denied my case. I reopened the case after doing everything they said to do including sending the product back to yet another country Vietnam. Then they said they would reimburse my shipping and they did NOT.
