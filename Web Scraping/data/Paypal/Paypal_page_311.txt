If I was to say what i actually thought of paypal and its customer service It wouldn't be allowed to be on here! Words don't begin to cover how annoyed and frustrated I am. I sold an item via eBay been with paypal and ebay for numerous years aswell as im a regular seller. So decided to sell some motorcycle parts to put into my other project as they were taking up space so rather than have it sitting doing nothing i thought id sell. Everything was spot on buyers end fella was more than happy with the item left me great feedback but my end different story all together. After contacting PayPal 6 times after waiting over a week to get no where they said the money was on hold untill the buyer confirmed delivery and that he was happy via feedback. Once this was all done and received paypal stated they would then have to send an email to the already happy buyer to confirm that he was indeed happy with the item basicly stating I wasn't being honest wich wasn't much of an issue as there could always be an issue if someone says the item was not as described etc. Anyways that was never going to be the case so I thought I'd leave it be untill the buyer clarified everything once again! and he did this then freed up the money so it showed in my PayPal balance as available so I thought Great but it was short lived as i realised when I went to try and transfer the funds into my bank account. It was being held for another 24 hours as they need to do more checks im not being funny but how many more checks is there to actually do surely all the checks should have been done the week the money was held rather than when the money was made available surely were at the pont of no return now lol but like I said paypal says one thing and means another all together so basicly I can't access it unless I either spend it on ebay or wait until paypal do these other checks find it completely ridiculous and out of order considering the transfer i tried to do was to my actual bank account that I've used from the very start thats registerd in my name there quick enough to take payments out of zed account when I make a purchases in excess of £300-£1000 on parts etc. Theres no checks that need happen then to make sure its me spending the money via PayPal yet when I sell something and try to get my funds i get treated like I've hacked someone's account or im not who i say i am. What checks could paypal possibly have to do to verify the money is going into the same bank account as whats been registered since the very first day i opened the paypal account. Aswell as ive bought loads of items using the exact same card paypal shouldn't be allowed to continue trading as its fraud. Ive been more than fair with everything I've had to do paypal genuinely have more control over your money than you the actual seller have it shouldnt be this much of battle and there certainly shouldn't be this much red tape to get through after all the previous requirements. I've since took all my other parts off ebay id rather have them gathering dust in my garage than have to go through any of this carry on ever again every paypal representative is useless and unhelpfull. Also spoke to a paypal manager and he was about as much use as a fart in a space suit to be honest they all are id already jumped through more than enough hoops to make sure everything is safe and secure for me and the buyer yet I get treated like this even after the seller has confirmed everything is spot on. This is unacceptable how paypal is getting away with this its completely outrageous!! I thought I'd let anyone else know the aggro its caused me to hopefully save some other person all this grief and carry on!", 'review_date': '2021-07-04', 'review_time': '15:10:52', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
