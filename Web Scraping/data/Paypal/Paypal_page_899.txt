A few days later, I was notified that my buyer had filed a chargeback under "unauthorized transaction" .

I was selling an intangible item - bitcoins, thru a platform called Localbitcoins.com\n\nThe buyer agreed a price with me, and sent me the money in paypal. When i checked the money was in my account, i sent the bitcoins to that user and left my computer.\n\nWhen i got back some hours later, i saw some e-mails from Paypal with some dispute raised by the buyer. I thought it was strange since i was pretty sure everything went OK.\n\nSo they buyer started a dispute of item not received. 6 minutes later, he closed that dispute saying it was settled. 5 minutes later to that, the buyer claimed "unauthorized transaction" on his account, and Paypal hold my money while the investigation was under way.\n\n1 hour and 11 minutes later, Paypal sends me an e-mail saying that the case was solved and even stated: "Thanks for your quick response about the following transaction:" although i was never contacted. The case was closed in favour of the buyer and money was reverted back to the buyer.\n\nSo basically after all this, my money was taken from my Paypal account and given back to the buyer. And also i was left without my bitcoins that i had previously sent to him. After this I saw that the buyer did this to other users on localbitcoins.com, because 2 or 3 persons were leaving feedback stating the same experience i had.\n\nSo basically, this was my first and most probably last experience as a seller with Paypal. It really seems unprofessional to settle a case like this without even consulting me. I totally lost my confidence in this system, even though i\'m using it for years as a buyer...\n\nafter google search (search terms: "paypal unauthorized payment and reverse payment scam") i found that i\'m not the only one that has been thru this... and paypal seems to always decide in favour of the buyer... i even found stories like mine with 6 years already and still they are not protecting sellers against this???', 'review_date': '2014-02-14', 'review_time': '23:28:17', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

I decided to have clients make purchases using PayPal instead of the credit card processor on my website since PayPal’s interest rate was a little lower. Everything was going find for a couple of month until they held a two thousand plus dollar purchase. I was only told by email that I was not abiding by their terms and their decision was final and that I could not appeal. I took the time to read all of their terms and conditions and there was nothing there that applied to my business. I asked them to specifically tell me what agreement I was not following and they would not tell me. I talked to a supervisor at PayPal and he told me he did not see any reason why my account was suspended but that he was not in the department that did this. I was not allowed to talk to anyone from that department because the totalitarians at PayPal said there decision was final and could not be appealed. Now I could care less what terms a company chooses to have. If they want to prohibit blue eye persons from using their service I am fine with that and won’t use their service. But to say you are breaking their terms and agreement when you are not and not giving you any details is absurd. To make matters worse PayPal tells you that they are going to keep your money for 6 months before giving it to you. Paypal are a bunch of thieves. They won’t even let you close your account while it is suspended. Fortunately I reacted quickly and returned the money to the client who then paid me through my website. I would not suggest anyone using PayPal unless you want to be vulnerable to arbitrary theft of your money and dictatorial customer service.', 'review_date': '2014-02-14', 'review_time': '22:13:42', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

A little over 2 months after owning this device, on the morning of January 31, 2014, I was unable to use the T-Mobile carrier service on this phone, specifically a "Not registered on this network" error message. After trying everything I knew how to resolve what seemed like a hardware issue, I gave up and called T-Mobile. The first time, I was told the phone had been blacklisted and not much more or why. The second time I called, I was then told that, because the original owner failed to make payments on this phone, the account had gone into a delinquency state, and the device deactivated. I made the seller aware of this circumstance. His response generally indicated he couldn\'t be bothered with a resolution. After researching my ordeal, and finding several other victims of similar circumstances, I became concerned and irritated and filed a claim with eBay, Bill Me Later, and Paypal--to no avail. The seller became aware of this and retaliated by e-mail basically saying he was washing his hands of the situation and dealing with eBay directly.\n\nAt the time, his auction listing contained the following information: "This Note 3 Has NEVER been opened, It is still in the factory box SEALED! EMIE is Clear as of posting of this add. No Returns. I also have a White Note 3 in same condition. $20 Shipping cost covers insurance and will be shipped same day after payment is confirmed. NO new buyers!" No where in this listing did he specify that the item up for auction was associated with an account/equipment lease agreement that had not been fulfilled. He purposely left out this information, fraudulently sold an item that he had not completely paid for, and worst waited until the return periods of all three companies were up before he defaulted on his account obligations with T-Mobile. Thus leaving me with a near $700 paperweight. Upon contacting all three of the mentioned merchants, Bill Me Later, PayPal, and eBay, they all said there was nothing they could do because of their policies, i.e. past the point of return. Paypal suggested that I submit a report to all the major fraud investigation entities. As it stands now, in my opinion, eBay, Paypal, and BillMeLater, by allowing this seller to get away with this travesty, played an integral role in providing the platform for this man\'s deceptive trade practice."\n\nLong story short: for eBay, Paypal, and BillMeLater, their company policies are more important to them than common sense, our legal system, and worse yet--basic ethical practices. If you\'re thinking about making fairly expensive purchases through either of them--DON\'T. If something goes wrong--even criminally wrong--all you will receive is regurgitated policy and "too bad" if it\'s past their grace/return periods. You\'re better off using your credit card since their fraud protection actually PROTECTS you from FRAUD.\n\nConsider yourself warned.', 'review_date': '2014-02-08', 'review_time': '17:48:24', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
