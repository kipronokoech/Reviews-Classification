They allowed purchases through Paypal, so that reinforced me thinking they were a good seller.\n\nI was so wrong. Eneba sent me a PlayStation Now key that had already been activated. I went through their support and they wouldnâ€™t refund or replace it. I opened a dispute with PayPal, waited 2 weeks, and when Eneba responded to them they closed the case. I provided everything I had to PayPal but they didnâ€™t have the decency to check with me before closing the case. I called PayPal and the customer service rep indicated to me that because I had no way to prove it was a fraudulent key (besides screenshots of my account showing it wasnâ€™t active, and a screenshot of me trying to activate the key), they would not take action against the seller.\n\nSo, goodbye PayPal.
