Went to webchat and tried at least 6 times and got no response. Emailed 3 complaints through and got no replies there either. Even tried email their CEOs but even there got no reply. Facebook and twitter paypal messages and complaints also gone unanswered. I actually believe this company will only respond to you if you're paying them by having an expensive business account. My neighbour has a business account and on his contact us page he has all the means of getting in contact including a call us option. If you're not on a business account that call us option is not available. So if you don't pay them by having a business account they're not interested and will ignore all communication. Company is a scam and they have shown that they're not interested unless they're getting money.

I have been scammed because I called customer service and the guy who was “helping” me had me to download an app (actually 2) AnyDesk and QuickSupport. I got emails saying to se d the buyer money through zelle , that was so my account could be upgraded. So as he was helping me he needed to see where I sent the money to zelle , then we proceeded to do “dummy accounts” the first one he had it reversed instantly, so there were a few more and as we talked and tested the system 3 transactions didn’t get “voided”. Then we moved to my cash app so they could pay me in full and apply it there . I was instructed to put money on my account and delete my cards and put in a gift card number (which he provided) while we are doing this he is going from one screen to the next , I paid out the amount on cash app because it was all going into my account right ? Hell no !!! Then as I continue to question the money that wasn’t “voided”or “reverses” he said he would have to call me back In the morning because the banks are closed and can’t get any transactions to go through !! He took me for over $3000 and I have paid to ship the wedding dress $75 which will be there In a few days , paid the buyer $400 and plus I still don’t have anything showing in my PayPal account and my bank accounts are In the negative which yes that’s our life savings !!!! I am left here sick to my stomach , with no money , no dress and no pride because I let this happen because I trusted someone !!!! God will take care of the final ending but for now I am ashamed how this happened , I’m not a stupid person and yet this crap happened so I can look at my family knowing I am to blame and hope like hell his guy “Harry” will call in the morning and get this straight !!’ Please beware because this happened and I never seen it coming !
