They are involved in mass corruption. They claimed I did a $1,227.90 fraud return Aug 7, 2023, however, the money was in a virtual wallet I could withdraw at anytime. I noticed my money gone out of the virtual wallet, when I called them, they lied and said I called it in as fraud, I demanded proof I called it in as fraud because I didn't. One of their workers told me the Fraud department did it and opened a new account.\nI researched and started running into feedback where I wasn't the only one they did this to. People were getting hacked, and they were double dipping. As, I believe the fraud department needs to be investigated, as they are doing mass fraud. They often do this and than act like they never received the money back and make you pay for money you didn't have access too. The morning of the recent attacks, they forwarded the balance they got back and now want me to pay for it.\nThere is a lot of youtube video's consumer affairs reports and other things of them doing this to others. The hackers, people doing paypal scams are actually doing it from within paypal themselves. The scams are a inside job from the fraud department working with overseas programmers and hackers.\nStay away from them, turn in reports to the FBI or other fraud reporting agencies, as there is huge amounts of people they are doing this to.", 'review_date': '2023-10-26', 'review_time': '02:06:37', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
