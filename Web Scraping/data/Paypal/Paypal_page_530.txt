Made a purchase assuming Paypal would help retrieve refund if there was an issue with the product. However the robotic humans manning resolution centre are unable to grasp the concept seller has provided a non existent returns address, which means i cant actually arrange to return the product. Paypal constantly rules in favour of seller as am ‘unable to upload proof of returns’ - which is obviously not possible in this instance. Lesson learnt - if making purchases over £100 you’re better protected using credit card alone (less complications when claiming chargeback as this incompetent third party is not involved).

However, when I tried to log in to close the account, I still can\'t gain access. They claim their is no phone number on my account, which is not correct because I get a notice saying I will receive a one time text code to my listed phone number, that never comes. So, I can\'t log in and they don\'t know how to fix it and won\'t update or close the account. Their last response to me was that they would send it to support and support would call me. Really?
