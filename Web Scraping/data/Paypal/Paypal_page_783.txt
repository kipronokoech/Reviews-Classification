Despite telling the seller I wanted a refund already, they have now sent an automated email saying they have the item back and do I ant it re-sent or refunded? Obviously a delaying tactic, as they do not want to refund. Paypal meanwhile deicded the case in the seller favour, despite them having the item back and my money. I won;t be using paypal again.
