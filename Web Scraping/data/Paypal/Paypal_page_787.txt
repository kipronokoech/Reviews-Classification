After a charge to my bank account didn’t go through I paid right away via by credit card. Then a week later PayPal tried to charge my bank account again, resulting in a returned NSF fee. This is a week after the payment went through on my credit card - saying complete on my PayPal summary page, and my credit card statement. I waited on hold for over 2.5 hours trying to resolve this, and most likely would have waited more if my phone hadn’t died. After finally getting to communicate with a PayPal representative, either through email or phone call, I got further disorganized and inconsistent responses. One person told me the credit card payment takes 3-5 days to go through, another person told me 5-10 days for a payment to go through. I demanded they pay the returned NSF, and so PayPal sent me a complete bogus “Bank Letter” saying it would result in my bank waiving the returned NSF fee, but my bank didn’t even care about that letter. And why would they? They didn’t do anything wrong - PayPal did. And they should of had to pay for their mistake. All of this caused me such distress that I have decided to close my PayPal account - a process that had taken over a week! - and will never recommend PayPal to anyone I know. At least, do not let them have you bank account information. Even my bank told me that.
