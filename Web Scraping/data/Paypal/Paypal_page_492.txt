I bought a reborn doll from the Chinese,hadn't realised it was coming from china to begin with of course the doll came only made to look like the one they advertised, different clothes completely different features random hair looked nothing like the doll advertised. There was no way I was going to present this to my daughter on Xmas Day! So opened a despute (not as descripted) seller sniderly offered £30 partial refund! They know what there doing...declined the offer! I just wanted full refund so I could go purchase another from a verified retailer as I should of done in the first place so then Seller offered full refund if I send the doll back and upload tracking which as then I will get the full refund! I complained about this under the consumer rights act 2015 as the seller is obliged to pay for return postage costs if an item is not as described and they did not give 2 f**** seriously they said i know what ur saying but to get a full refund you need to send it back! I got quoted £33 from myhermes and £45 parcelforce £52 DHL ect so was basically backed into a corner. PayPal just kept saying but you can get the postage cost returned through the return postage scheme £15 max! Who was gunna pay the other £18???? You literally want shutting down, I guarantee you got all ur fingers in all pies with loads of companies doing everyone out there hard earned money. We are the victims when we are sold an item that doesn't look anything like what there advertising! Not the person sending this item! Sort yourselves out Paypal.

When I made the purchase, PayPal suggested to pay with my PayPal account so I would have Buyer's Protection. That made sense to me, and for the first (and last) time ever I paid for the purchase with my PayPal account. The seller sent a mirror for a totally different car which, of course, did not fit and could not connect to the electronics of my car. When I tried to return the mirror, the seller requested for it to be sent to INDIA, even though he had shipped it from Utah, USA. To send the item to INDIA would cost way more than I paid for the item. Additionally, the address provided did not even look like a legitimate address. Long story short — PayPal has not helped in this matter at all. They have come up with more and more outrageous requests what I have to do to get a refund: sending the item back to India which would cost about $100 for the $50 part, then when it gets returned because the address is fake, show them the receipt, filing a report with the FBI, getting an official letter from the post office showing that the address is fake,(impossible to get) etc. etc. The buyer's protection is obviously more of a seller's protection. With a policy like this, the seller can use PayPal to send whatever they want, get paid, and then leave the buyer with no recourse for reimbursement, and no repercussions for the criminal seller's action. I have communicated with PayPal for over 3 months now, and they are not willing to do anything at all. Please be ware, if you use PayPal, the Buyer's Protection is completely useless.
