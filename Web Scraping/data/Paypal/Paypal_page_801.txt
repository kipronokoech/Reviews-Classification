I always pay through Paypal for on-line shopping. This April, I placed 2 orders online, totaling 11 items worth more than $150. By the end of May, I only received 2 items, one from each order, and tried so many times to communicate with the seller with no success. I opened 2 cases with Paypal against this company. Very soon, Paypal closed both cases because they received the proof of delivery from the seller. I appealed their decision and explained the proof of delivery was only for 1 item shipped but there were still many missing items. Then I received a stunning Paypal decision------if I return the 2 items received to the company's main office in China, I could get the money refunded. Sending these items to China would cost more money then the amount I could get for refund. I addition, there is no tracking system for shipping in China, so I would not be able to prove the delivery. This company has a branch in California but I had to send the items to China. Also, I only wanted the refund for the non-receipt items. Paypal did not do a thorough and fair investigation. Never read my case details carefully. Every time I called and talked to the staff, they were cold and brief. Nobody cared but just want to end the conversation. This is a terrible company doing business in a very irresponsible way . When things are smooth, it is convenient to use paypal, When things go wrong, Paypal just would not protect and help you.", 'review_date': '2018-07-12', 'review_time': '17:37:01', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
