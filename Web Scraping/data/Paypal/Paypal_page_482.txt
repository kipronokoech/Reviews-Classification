Even when the seller does not respond to disputes opened. For this, it is five stars to PayPal for support excellence.\n\nNow the things that PayPal can improve on (PayPal can consider these):\n\n1. Allow refunds x 150% of original price guaranteed by certain sellers who say they will refund up to 300% of the original price, if their product does not work as promised. (Currently right now PayPal only help refunds that equates to original price paid to seller.)\n\n2. PayPal states that only USA-based businesses can register for a business account. Does this mean individuals (freelancers and artistry housewives) won't be able to accept payments for cakes or other goods they sell online unless they send their customers and shoppers an invoice?\n\nAnd the integration procedure to website seems complex to a non-developer like me.\n\n3. I hope PayPal will also accept payments from those without debit or credit card but has a telco where PayPal can bill to. Meaning, money from shoppers' telco wallets can be deducted when they shop online.\n\nThis is about 82% of the India population not having even a single bank account but who has cash in their telco firms (for their mobile phone bills). Reasonable fees/charges can be billed to the online sellers - without the seller having to rely on using a registered business (eg. Own personal name) .\n\nThis feature could be a boon for all: convenience for the buyers without cards, profitability to the telcos and PayPal.\n\nSo PayPal can consider these four doable actions to scale their business and help people like me with no registered business (it used to be just $25 to register a business in SG, now you need at least SG$315 and more just so to start a new business bank account).\n\nP.S.\nAny direct carrier service who offer such a service as I describe above, please feel free to contact me. Thank you.", 'review_date': '2020-10-15', 'review_time': '11:00:17', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

I looked them up online and it turned out they scammed many others (onlinethreatalerts: article: is-dreamkis-vip-a-scam-see-the-review-of-the-online-store) with the same 'deal'. Others who had been scammed turned to PayPal and some said they received a refund and got to keep the cheap tennis ball. At this point I turned to PayPal to deal with the fraudulent seller. PayPal wanted me to RETURN the tennis ball to the vendor and provide a tracking number. I thought this ridiculous and took it to the post office expecting to lose about $10 for shipping which I would have done on principle. The post office wanted $70 to send the tennis ball to the vendor with tracking. Of course I did not ship the ball and PayPal closed the case due to my not providing a valid tracking number.
