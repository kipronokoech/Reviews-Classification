{'platform': 'Paypal', 'id': '632939736a3e1ed2c3d73f05', 'stars': 1, 'title': 'Most people don’t realize using PayPal is so risky.', 'message': 'PayPal is beyond terrible. It’s extremely easy to lose money when using PayPal. There are countless horror stories on the Internet about it. Just look at all the one-star reviews here on Trustpilot! Page after page after page of one-star complaints. PayPal is thoroughly despised!\n\nThe only time I use PayPal is when I have no choice. That is, sometimes my credit card won’t work for a certain merchant, which forces me to use PayPal. I had to do that a couple of weeks ago.\n\nThere are so many security issues when using PayPal, a book could be written about it. First off, to link your bank account, they want your bank’s login and password. That’s insane!! Luckily, I’m smart enough not to give out that kind of information to anyone. But PayPal pushes very hard to get it from you. So I have to assume the majority of people do it. They probably trust PayPal to keep it secure. (All those poor suckers will one day regret having done that.)\n\nAs far as them having my credit card number, I delete it as soon as my transaction is complete. Although I’m sure a talented hacker could get all that information anyway. It’s not like PayPal erases it from their records when you delete it from your account. I am a computer expert by profession, having worked in various financial institutions for over 40 years. Trust me when I say you should be very careful with computer transactions; especially where your money and identity are concerned. Don’t give your bank account number to anyone, because doing so risks hackers one day cleaning you out.\n\nPayPal offered me five dollars to open an account. But to get that money wasn’t worth all the hassle. You can’t just spend funds in a PayPal account with a PayPal transaction. Oh, no! That would be far too reasonable. Instead, you have to specifically transfer the money directly to your bank. That’s where the risk starts. Linking PayPal with your bank account is a very risky thing to do. To be cautious, I have a separate account at my bank for risky transactions. I keep only one dollar in it, except when I need to use it. Last month, some hacker tried to withdraw $65 from that account. Luckily for me, my bank rejected it. That’s a perfect example of why I keep a special account to give access to outsiders I don’t trust, like PayPal. Should anyone get that information, I can only lose the one dollar kept in the account.\n\nAs for PayPal, the instructions on their website don’t work. Instead, they pressure you to open all sorts of crazy accounts. You wind up going in circles trying to find out how to get your money. Take my advice—be very careful whenever you use PayPal.\n\nI was finally able to transfer my $5 to my bank account, but was forced to use their app on my iPhone to do so. I’ll be closing that bank account after I get my five dollars. When PayPal has that bank account number, I know it’s no longer safe to use.\n\nPayPal was started by the same crooks that created eBay. In my opinion, both were created by criminals, for criminals. (The kind of white collar criminals who never end up in jail where they belong.)\n\nIf you value your identity and security, stay away from PayPal.\nFar, far away!', 'review_date': '2022-09-20', 'review_time': '06:14:27', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
