So the day of vacation avis charged me the full rental amount, plus deposit. After I had already paid in full and should have had a $300 hold on my credit card. So now I have an authorization and have already paid a total of $1,049. This is day 1 of my vacation. I ask for my money back from avis and paypal. Neither company will look at it or try to resolve anything in anyway. I am quite upset at this point. But hey everyone going on vacation with a family of 4 has multiple extra thousands of dollars available to go with right? I end the vacation 1 day early. Lose the money paid for prepayment on the days activites. $260 gone. Come back home and return the car 1 day early. So a total of 6 days. I call avis and they are barely willing to refund me for the day I returned the car early. Only after arguing with the phone representitive for 20 minutes. Now 4 hours on the phone with paypal the superviser named Ron finally looks at the request. He told me for 5 minutes or more that it was not possible to close out the case today. I argued and kept asking him to look at the information from 7 days ago. FInally they agree that I should get my money back and they will send it in 3-5 days', 'review_date': '2023-07-30', 'review_time': '20:46:37', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

I am a single mother, an unemployed one right now at that because I'm attending college full time and focusing on my studies right now so all the money that we live off of or my student loans that I get once every 4 months and money from focus groups that I participate in here and there. I have a PERSONAL account on PayPal. I have $69 in my account to take care of my daughter on and to make it by with, to buy food and diapers for her and gas for my car. I get on there and it says that PayPal has permanently limited my account! I do not make buyer seller transactions whatsoever nothing but private transactions between friends and family. You would think that I would be some big ringleader of something according to them with my little bit of student loan money that I get! HA! Then they can't seem to tell me why my account has been done this way! Well I am absolutely positively 1,000% sure that there is no way I violated any of their terms! I've never had a transaction on there over $500 not one time. How this place has a A+ rating with the BBB is way beyond me, but since that right there is the case they are supposed to offer transparency and be transparent with its customers which they know nothing about. Customer service is terrible you can't even understand what they're saying to you. Nor do they ever understand what you're saying to them either. Look up and see how many class action lawsuits an individual lawsuit has been brought against them for this! MANY! SO NOW THANKS TO THEM KEEPING MY BIG $69, I have to struggle some more trying to come up with a way to get that money back so I'm able to take care of my 2-year-old daughter and that's a lot of money to us it might not be to everybody else but it is to us. I had just enough money to make it through until I got my next loan deposit.
