Paypay was the only available payment method. It turns out the whole thing was a SCAM--the seller had stolen some text and images from a Kickstarter campaign and was "selling" a device that was not theirs and had not yet actually been produced.\n\nTo complete the fraud, they shipped a small box of unrelated electronic junk so that they would have a tracking record that the order had been delivered.\n\nIt turns out I\'m far from the only person to which this happened.\n\nNow, my complaint about Paypal is that when I disputed the transaction and asked for my money back, Paypal both put every possible obstacle in my way, and, when they finally agreed that this was a scam, insisted on charging me $40 to ship back the unrelated and unordered junk and then I have to wait until the scammer notifies Paypal that they received the junk to get the remainder (less the $40) of my money back.\n\nWhy would I think the scammer would even be motivated to do that?\n\nI am immensely disappointed that Paypal buyer protection really doesn\'t protect the buyer at all.\n\nThe clear lesson out of this is no one should ever use Paypal to pay for a purchase. Paypal will NOT protect your purchase and will make things as difficult as possible to deal with Scammers (and with Paypal itself).\n\nCredit card issuers give the Purchaser protection that Paypal should give the Purchaser but does not.\n\nDon\'t use Paypal to pay for your purchases or risk losing your money!', 'review_date': '2020-01-30', 'review_time': '20:08:54', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
