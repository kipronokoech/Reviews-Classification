The company unbeknown to me (no evidence on the website and it is not easy to find an address) is in China. Paypal have said that I can get a full refund if I post the four stools back to China at my cost.\n\nPostage is going to cost me over £400 via courier and it's the cheapest we can find. Paypal also forced me to get a third party appraisal of the chairs as they didn't believe our photos or information.\n\nWe spend days finding a company to perform this appraisal and had to pay £225 to get it done which I expected to be refunded as they requested we get one. They have refused to refund us the appraisal and have said we can send the stools back at our cost.\n\n£225 + £400 postage = £625\n\nThe chairs cost £618 so now we have the dilemma of being £225 already out of pocket and sending them back or being forced to keep them so we dont loose anymore money.\n\nI have made over 5 complaints to PayPal and requested higher level management contact us to sort the issue out all of which has been completely brushed under the carpet.\n\nThey have absolutely no interest in protecting the buyer at all and have caused a lot of stress over the last month for all this we have had to do. The company from China have miraculously removed the chairs for sale and they cant be found yet PayPal are still insisting we spend £400 on sending them back at our cost?\n\nI am absolutely appalled by Paypals behaviour and expected more protection.
