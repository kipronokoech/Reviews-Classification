Didn't use paypal all that often but was convenient the few times I did use it. Back on 9/3, there was an unauthorized transfer for 1000.00 from my bank account to my paypal account. My account had also been changed from English to Spanish as well as my phone number. Within hours of the transfer, I noticed this happened. Paypal did nothing to stop the transaction from completing. In fact, they left me on hold for 45 minutes. I ended up hanging up on them. I wanted to remove my bank accounts from my paypal account and it wouldn't let me. I had to put a hold on my bank account so now they do not have access to it. As soon as this 1000.00 hit my paypal account, I transferred it back to my bank account (as it can still take credits even though the account was on hold). Now paypal says I owe them $1000.00 and my paypal account has negative 1000.00. I called paypal again and they claimed that I got 2 credits from them. One on the 2nd of September. It doesn't even make any sense as the unauthorized transaction didn't even take place until 9/3. I still have not resolved the issue as of yet as I have been on hold for the last 3+ hours with paypal and my bank trying to figure out why on earth i owe paypal anything at all. As soon as all of this gets resolved, I am going to close my paypal account of 10 years and never look back. As little as i used it, i certainly can live without it. I would never recommend paypal to anyone. They don't care about their customers getting hacked and getting money stolen from them. $1000.00 is a lot of money to some people especially in these trying times with Covid.", 'review_date': '2020-09-15', 'review_time': '18:04:11', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
