My sister had sent me money and it went to a close account.Since the money didn\'t go to an open account she sent it again to the right account. The bank had sent her money back without going through PayPal so PayPal in turn take my account negative. They had no reason to so I called and the lady I spoke with was incredibly rude and told me I had scammed someone so I need to pay them because my "customer" didn\'t receive an item. First of all it was my sister who was sending money to a friend through me and second she had already received a refund. They didn\'t have record of the refund because obviously it didn\'t go through them. I tried explaining this to the lady as she continued to yell at me that I was scamming people and the "board" had already sided with the "customer". Again I had to repeat myself 1000 times. The lady then proceed to tell me I was an awful person for scamming my sister and my account will continue to go negative till I pay them for the refund they will never send. She hung up on me. A few days later I check my PayPal and they had taken more money. Now my account is negative over $200 and the amount that was sent to me was only $100. I started to dispute the charges which could take up tp 75 days. I received a letter saying I was negative and it would go to a collection agency. My bf read the letter and paid it not knowing I had already had it disputed. I refunded the money instantly. Before they took it out of the account. Not even 20 minutes later the money is gone from my PayPal and now were out money. The refund was denied for obvious reasons so I tried to send it again. Now PayPal is saying the refund has to come from my back account because I TOOK THE MONEY. Why would I take money from my bf and my sister. Another thing they are too stupid to realize is my bf and I share a bank account the numbers match up perfectly. So when they are refunding the money they are taking it from my account and putting it right back in my account so its not really a refund. Overall my experience has been awful. I also forgot to mention this is my second PayPal account because they did the exact thing 3 years prior when I didn\'t receive and item from a seller. My sister has also had a similar experience.
