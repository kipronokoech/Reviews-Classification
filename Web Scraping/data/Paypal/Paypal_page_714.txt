Ebay encouraged me to send the item out and Paypal did too by providing me with an address. I sent out the item and then was faced with a Chargeback by the 'buyer'. It was all a fraud. Paypal took the money back from me and gave it back to the 'owner' of the card. The games console was over £300 and I have only just finished paying it off. I'm disabled and it totally devastated me financially. Paypal claim it was because I sent it to an unconfirmed address so they wouldn't protect me. If it was a false address then why did they forward it to me???? I feel I was owed a duty of care but Paypal don't see it like that. Be warned, even if it is a confirmed address you can be subject to Chargeback. Some people went on Rip Off Britain and Paypal gave them their money back as a 'goodwill gesture' but would not even consider my case.

{'platform': 'Paypal', 'id': '5d7e87f63585c70644a3301a', 'stars': 1, 'title': 'Paypal unaware of Consumer Rights Act 2015', 'message': "I received a severely damaged item from a UK company which led to a dispute that finished up with the Paypal resolution centre. I was hopeful that this would resolve the problem. The resolution process can take up to 30 days and there is no mechanism for speaking to any Paypal staff nor to send any photographs of a damaged item. The process seems to be all computer controlled. Paypal states that they will liaise with the seller and then make a judgement and their decision will be final and if it is not accepted within 10 days the case will be closed and I will not get a refund. In my case it was decided that I would be given a full refund for the damaged item provided that I returned it via tracked delivery at my expense. The item is bulky and would cost me about two thirds of the cost of the item. So Paypal consider it fair that I the buyer pay this even though the item was either despatched damaged or was damaged in transit. Furthermore, Paypal is disregarding the Consumer Rights Act 2015. This makes it clear that any returns policy of a company for supplying goods that arrive damaged should be borne by the company who should arrange for the item to be collected or will reimburse the buyer for the cost of returning it. My opinion of the Paypal resolution process is that it is unfair with an apparent ignorance of the law. It is not worth my time and effort to fight for my rights in this case but if a larger sum of money had been involved I would have considered legal action. I sent the points above directly to Paypal but they were ignored and they responded “We've reviewed the transaction(s) and are denying your claim(s). This decision was made because we did not receive valid proof or tracking that you returned the merchandise.” This was in spite of the fact that I told them I had not returned the merchandise and ticked a box on their response form stating that I had not returned it.", 'review_date': '2019-09-15', 'review_time': '18:50:30', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

You should not.', 'message': 'I have been using PayPal for over a decade, with hundreds of transactions under my account. Alas, there came a day where I needed to use their resolution center to dispute an order.\n\nI ordered several items online from a shop that split the order without my consent, shipping one cheap item with a normal tracking number and never shipped the rest of the order. The cheap item did arrive but nothing else ever did. I opened a dispute, only for the seller to provide the tracking number of the cheap item. PayPal\'s arbitrator closed the dispute in favor of the seller, ignoring the fact that the tracking number was for just one item and not for the whole order. I contacted PayPal and complained, resulting to reopening the dispute but only for it to close again with the same reason. I even gave them my login credentials for my account at the shop for the arbitrator to enter and see that the order is split and the seller did not give me a tracking number for most items, they ignored even that.\n\nBottom line is, I was obviously paying PayPal\'s premium fees all this time for nothing. If you think that you are in any way safer when paying with PayPal, you are sadly mistaken. All it takes is for a seller to provide a working tracking number and it will not matter if they shipped you just one item out of 20, PayPal favors the seller. It is safer to just pay directly and use VISA\'s/Mastercard\'s dispute process. There is absolutely no reason to use PayPal for shopping online, they will only charge greater exchange fees than a bank and, apparently, their greatly advertised "safety" is nothing but a visage.', 'review_date': '2019-09-15', 'review_time': '15:36:47', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
