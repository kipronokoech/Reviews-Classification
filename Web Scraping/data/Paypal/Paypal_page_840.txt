When that happens,\nGOOD LUCK!!!! I spent $250.00 on ebay ordering 2 coats from China. They were advertised as mink fur. I realized that was an improbably low price for mink, which is why I had to have them! I figured mink must be a dime a dozen over there like any of the other things they advertise on ebay that they sell\nfor a fraction of the cost we pay in Canada. Since I only needed the fur for craft purposes,\nI decided it wouldn't matter even if the craftsmanship was bad, because I only needed the actual fur in small strips. Coats arrived and were fake fur, which were totally useless to me. I contacted the seller and asked why she was advertising them as mink fur when they were fake fur? She said it is illegal in China to use real mink and everyone knows that. She refused to let me return them. Paypal agreed that I was in the right and told me to return them and keep the tracking information, and I would definitely be getting a refund. Seller would not accept the package\nand it wasn't returned to me. I had to pay $130.00 to send them back. Went through mental anguish over this for 2 solid years!! Was not the money, it was the principal, and I refused to give up. In the end, I got back the package from China, which had been opened by someone and one of the coats stolen. I jumped through all the hoops Paypal demanded and threw good money after bad and never received a refund. I was bound and determined not to give up the endless correspondence and phone calls with PayPal.\nAt first they'd tell me to go after ebay. Ebay would tell me to go after Paypal and on and on.\nIn the end, I had no choice to just give up because these crooks are smarter and more stubborn than I am and could torture me for eternity without solving anything. It is extremely hard on the nerves. I will live without the money, but I can't stand Paypal or Ebay now, because they both protected a dishonest\nseller and I paid the penalty for it. Oh well, I guess it was better than a bunch of poor little mink sacrificing their lives just so I could fart around with my little craft project . . . but that is beside the point!!", 'review_date': '2017-09-10', 'review_time': '01:20:38', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
