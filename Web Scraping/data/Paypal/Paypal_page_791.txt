Seems like the point the finger at me being the risky one, but tell me that cannot tell me why - and don;t even have the ability to tell me why - when I push to talk to someone who can offer more answers, they tell me I have "reached the right department", and basically no one in the company can tell me why - because the security rules are "hard coded" and basically no one is able to tell me what part of this transaction, or why this transaction, is risky.\n\nAgainst my better judgement, I have shipped the package. One way to have the money unlocked is to ship the package, and input tracking number. When it\'s received, a day later the money is unlocked. However, I pick the shipper, Canada Post, and when I click the finish button it always reverts to DHL, for some unknown reason - this telling me my tracking is invalid and PayPal will not release my funds for 21 days.\n\nThe accountant/auditor in me sees this as a very thinly and dishonestly veiled way to inflate the cash balance in PayPal\'s books. They get to keep your money for 21 days, and basically earn short term interest on your hard earned cash while you have to wait - interrupting your cash flow.\n\nAbsolutely criminal.\n\nSomeone actually called me a dinosaur today because I mentioned I use PayPal.

I let it go and a few months later, the account was working just fine and I've used it for years to receive money for my freelance work and make simple purchases online. I had a credit card and a bank account linked and then suddenly they're asking for proof of identity and proof of address and not accepting anything I sent nor letting me withdraw or transfer my money. I was using an Israeli account but had moved to the US later on and kept using my account but they wouldn't accept a proof of an american address nor an Israeli P.O.Box. Then the moment they found out I have a Palestinian address, they permanently limited my account with over $900 in it. I've contacted them throughout this whole problem at each step to get help but their customer service was crappy as always and they kept answering with the same email over and over which had nothing to do with the questions I actually asked in my emails. I now have an account with $900 that I can't withdraw for 180 days and then I have no idea how they will let me withdraw it but this whole experience was horrible and I don't recommend at all.
