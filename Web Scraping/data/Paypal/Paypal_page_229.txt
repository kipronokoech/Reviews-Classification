I thought that was fine, so went ahead & did it only to find I was charged a conversation rate for refunding the money I never requested in the first place!\n\nI rang them back & was told "yes, this is the conversation fee"... to which my response was "I didn\'t want to receive the payment in the first place, I don\'t know the sender, I\'m trying to do the right thing be returning the money & I followed your instructions to do so... now I\'ve been charged for it?!" There answer was "yes, we\'re just the intermediary. You\'ll need to message the sender & ask them for the extra back". Seriously? On what planet is that acceptable?\n\nAnd absolute joke, no ownership, no accountability & the support staff just make it up as they go along.\n\nI\'ve had issues with PayPal before & will be closing my account after this incident.\n\nUPDATE.. This gets better... So after my 3rd phone conversation with them, I spoke to a really nice person in customer service who apologised & credited a £20 voucher to my account for the issues I\'d faced & the poor advice from the previous two support reps. Thinking it was all over, I went about my business.\n\nA few days later I go to buy a course from Udemy using the apology voucher from PayPal and... Oh look, PayPal have blocked my account!\n\nI call them (again) and apparently there\'s been a "violation to their terms of service which had the potential to result in financial loses". They can\'t give me any more information at this time & they don\'t have the ability to communicate with their mysterious back office guru\'s who make the decisions. In the meanwhile, I\'ve wasted an evening changing all of my subscriptions from PayPayl to a credit card before I start losing all my services.\n\nPayPal genuinely are an absolute joke. The service works fine but if you encounter any issues you\'re in for a bumpy ride. The support staff aren\'t just unhelpful, they pretty much lie to your face. I\'ve formally requested the call transcripts from the last 4 calls with them, so I can demonstrate how their staff lie to customers & make up services that don\'t exist.\n\nMy advice would be to delete your account & stick to using a credit card for online transactions.
