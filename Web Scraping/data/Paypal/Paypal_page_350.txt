The wing span on this jet is as long as I am tall 5"4". So pretty hard to find an odd shaped box for the whole damn plane.\nSo, it\'s going on almost 2 weeks now, my husband is a mobile auto repair mechanic, he had a customer, who was out of state and coming through KC, and he was having car trouble. My husband repaired his vehicle and customer paid for services to my Paypal account. So what do they do, flagged my account, and put this much needed $ on hold. I have receipt of signed repair order from customer that already verified his payment to me. When I called CSR stated to talk with customer and have him confirm payment. So I did and still 48 hours layer, $ still on hold! Called customer and he was going to look into the situation also.\nThen I received today that customer supposedly is disputing the transaction.\nI have sent a picture of repair order and his dispute is that there is no where for the buyer to "confirm" payment. They say once customer does that the $ would be released immediately!\nThat is a lie! They have a receipt to show what his payment is for, and keep giving me a run around.\nJust very disgusted with the way they do business. The 3x I have called I was on hold for over an hour and I still don\'t have this problem solved!\nMost of the CSR can\'t speak clear English and talk over you when you tell them what the problem is. To me, it\'s horrible customer service! I\'m their customer. I, with the rest of PayPal account holders, are the reason they have a job in the 1st place!
