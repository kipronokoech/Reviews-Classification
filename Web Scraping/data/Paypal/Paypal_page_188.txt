My father's BF and business partner was from India and he was a gem dealer so I assumed that I could trust these people.\n\nWhat I received was gem glass not natural gemstones.\n\nI tested the items and found them to be fake/counterfeit and PayPal wanted me to spend my own money to send the gems back to get a refund.\n\nThe catch was the (fake) gems had to be returned in their original condition. Well, glass breaks. Gemstones don't. When you do a proper test, the stones are put under duress, heat and scratched.\n\nNaturally, fake (glass) gems will not fair like authentic gemstones. They will suffer damage. How can I return them in their original condition when after testing, they are damaged because they're glass and not actual gems?\n\nIf you want to purchase something, anything, use your credit card. Do not use PayPal. They do not protect consumers. PayPal protects their sellers and they're OK with their sellers committing fraud on purchasers.\n\nWord of advice, do not use your debit card or a PayPal account. Use your credit card. That way you can dispute a purchase that is fraudulent or or not what you expected.\n\nYou're welcome.", 'review_date': '2022-07-03', 'review_time': '03:04:47', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
