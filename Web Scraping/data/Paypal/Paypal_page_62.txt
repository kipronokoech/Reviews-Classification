But when it goes wrong, get ready for a LOT of stress.\n\nI was paid for the sale of an item through Paypal, who emailed me to say that they were holding the payment until I could provide them with some ID details to verify my account. I did so immediately, and received a reply email to say "thanks, we have lifted the limitations on your account"... but the payment never came. When I tried to ask them about this, they said that they\'d need the transaction ID number, to trace the payment. But I wasn\'t given one, as the payment never happened. So, they asked me to contact the payer, to ask them for the transaction ID (why should I have to do this? they made the error). I tried anyway, but of course I could not get one. This then went on for thirteen days. I would message Paypal through their only means of contact, their awful message centre that times you out randomly, doesn\'t save anything you\'ve typed, and gives your message to a new assistant every time, so of course you have to explain everything from the start again and again and again. Thirteen days of me having to explain the same thing to multiple assistants, who constantly assured me that they "understand my frustration" and "will do all that we can to help", and then just ask me for the transaction ID again. Very infuriating. At more than one point, they confused the missing payment with others that had happened smoothly, and asked me what the problem was. They also tried to suggest that the email from them, saying that they were holding the payment until I provided ID, was some sort of false email from a scammer. When I eventually managed to get through on the phone, after a 95 minute phone call, the assistant obviously realised the mistake that Paypal had made at the start, and sent me the initial email again (the one from 13 days previous), then got me to remove my email address from my account, then put it back in. This worked! Which proves that the error was totally on Paypal\'s side, nowhere else... so then I get a final message from Paypal, saying that they are "confident" that they did nothing wrong, and that the error was down to me inputting something wrong. They gave me no way to answer this, and ended the conversation. They deliberately showed no accountability for their obvious mistake, and allowed me no way to answer this. I continue to use them, but only because I have to.
