However, twice now in the space of eight months PayPal without warning or communications just locked our account making it completely inactive. This means customers cannot pay for their items won on eBay and no withdrawals can be made from the account. It's five days now since our account was locked and PayPal have failed to offer any reason or solution to the problem. Our email communications just fall on deaf ears and there's no telephone support, they say due to COVID-19, so how can eBay support call you back within 40 minutes? That's how customer service should be. This situation has pretty much stopped us from trading on eBay. As a result we strongly advise other businesses who use PayPal not to put all of your eggs in one basket. Instead make sure you have other good options for processing payments. Currently on eBay you are pretty much tied to PayPal but at the end of July eBay are moving to internally managed payments, which we think may be a blessing in disguise. I hate to say this, because I was a fan of PayPal, but from our experiences during the last eight months we believe PayPal have very much gone downhill and possibly have the worst customer service response of any company of this size. They really have managed to make me despair because they simply don't seem care anymore. We had roughly 19 years without any issues but in the last eight months our account has been frozen for a total of 13 days and still growing because its not fixed yet.", 'review_date': '2020-06-19', 'review_time': '21:41:35', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
