They were once a premier online payment processing service, now they are getting dumped at every corner by reputable businesses because they are thieves and criminals. They locked my daughters account and after 5 months of them basically ignoring us and sending form letters that weren\'t even related to our account (they had screwed something up and said the issue was over a year old when it was 30+ days) Finally after 5 months I decided it was time to retain council and file suit. I sent a last ditch email to the all but ignored "executiveoffices at paypal.com" email address where if they reply, it will be 30 days at best. I said I was moving forward with retaining council and filing suit in my local jurisdiction. I said I would allow for a reasonable amount of time for response prior to moving forward as a courtesy, mostly to show the court I had been more than accommodating. In the single most unexpected event of the 5 month debacle, they didn\'t respond but I got notice 24 hours later that the account was no longer restricted. I immediately withdrew the $2000 they had effectively stolen and refused to return and closed the account.\nShe had used the account for 8 months without a single issue. No chargebacks, no cases, no nothing. Suddenly one day the account is locked, says they need more information. This isn\'t unusual as you have to identify yourself so she did the three requested tasks and sent a copy of her driver\'s license within 24 hours of the request. The next 6 weeks were utterly unbelievable. The small business she was trying to start on ebay was shutout from taking payments. (ebay has since dumped them and fewer than 5% of customers now appear to be using paypal anymore based on our business records) We called 1 time a week for 6 weeks and were told every time, they couldn\'t do anything. The CSR\'s claimed to have no idea what was going on, but could see the account was locked. They said it was an internal review of the account and that once the info was submitted it should be unlocked within a couple days. Well by the 6th week they stopped saying that. I moved to finding the afore mention mostly ignored email address and went to the BBB site where I found them rated B. Never seen a company at B level, most horrible service corporations simply aren\'t accredited with the BBB. They had over 16,000 complaints in the last year a 1 star rating. No surprise there. I filed a complaint. BBB gives 30 days to respond, they respond the evening of the 29th day.....again not surprised. Their reply states they want shipping information for the items that were sold, personal identifying information for the account holder and a description of what is being sold as well as if it is a registered business. Well, all the transactions are sold online and shipped through paypal, paid for with paypal and tracked on paypal. That\'s BS reason 1. They want personal identification....BS reason 2 as the drivers license has already been uploaded, how much more personal can you get? A description of what is being sold is recorded at each sale and listed right there on the transaction...BS reason 3. Number 4 was the only legitimate question, though they had no business asking it. We responded accordingly. 25 days later they respond, asking for the same information again. Back and forth 4 times, BBB closes the case as unresolved. We then began trying to correspond with the executive offices via email. What a waste of time. Their response was always a form letter, and not one time did they have the correct account information. They were telling me about someone else\'s account for whom they had banned and refused to release their funds. Great, that\'s wonderful news and I guess that\'s the direction we\'re going? Last thing they sent said they were holding for 6 months, at which time they would consider releasing MY money. Time got away from me as I simply funded my daughter to move on, given the conditions of the country during Covid and paypals lack of caring whatsoever. My business was still running full tilt and we were in busy season so I had no time for these rejects. I had intended to file suit earlier, but time wasn\'t allowing me to get to the courthouse.\nAVOID these thieves at all costs.', 'review_date': '2021-07-22', 'review_time': '00:24:14', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

Could have got a better rate from a loan shark! Not surprised eBay has severed ties.\nUPDATE\nI am attempting to resolve this with PayPal & the reason for the charge of 3% is that it is a “transaction with”, not “a refund”. Yet both the payments to me by the seller clearly state “ refund for ……..invoice….”. This is clearly stated on both refunds. Yet the operative tells me that I am a seller & received a payment. When I questioned this, they told me that not only had they already explained, but also that I should check the transaction history. I have done both, have asked for details of where I am shown as the seller, what services/goods I have supplied - now I have silence! Saga continues\nFURTHER UPDATE\nAfter 3 days, endless message exchanges, being told that I would receive a call that day & keep phone free (call received 3 DAYS LATER), resolution achieved - exgratia refund of fees EXCEPT FOR A 30P CHARGE WHICH CANNOT BE REFUNDED.\nAlso got to the bottom of the problem. Once a transaction is posted it cannot be cancelled, it can be refunded. This results in the categorisation ALWAYS remaining & therefore the appropriate fees are charged. That in itself creates a tortuous route - via chat or mail. In the first instance the assistance stick to the script & simply explain the system & therefore justifying the charges. The solutions suggested do not reverse the fees. It’s only if you effectively post a complaint that it’s escalated to a complaint & then it takes days to hear from someone who has the authority to waive the fees. All this takes time & perseverance; most users don’t pursue; PayPal generally pocket the 3% fee ( nice if you can get the work - for effectively nothing!). PayPal need to make two changes: if a claim for error is submitted it should be reviewed & if found to be correct then the incorrect transaction should be CANCELLED & REVERSED IN FULL - this would automatically refund the fees. Secondly the 30p charge should also be refunded where it I found that the original transaction was erroneous.
