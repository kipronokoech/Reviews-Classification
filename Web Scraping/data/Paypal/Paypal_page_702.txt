I have Positive seller feedback and my buyers orders A high priority for me. Yesterday this happened to me where PayPal’s system decides to hold my funds. I contacted them and my funds will not be released to me until voter the buyer receives the order. I can understand when I was A first time seller starting out, but I have proven myself and their is no reason for PayPal to penalize me by holding what belongs to me especially if there hasn’t been a problem. The CSR basically said their system flags high risk products or something to that effect.What I don’t understand is what was so high risk? All it was was something along the lines that I usually sell and that was Kindle Oasis 9th Generation eReader. They only released under $15.00 so I could pay for the shipping. PayPal has already received their cut and decides to hold onto MY MONEY. I’ve done nothing wrong but yet I’m penalized because of something in their computer system! This is wrong on many levels! People need their money and PayPal should not hold someone’s funds who has positive feedback and makes sure their buyers get what they’ve paid for.', 'review_date': '2019-10-17', 'review_time': '22:32:45', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
