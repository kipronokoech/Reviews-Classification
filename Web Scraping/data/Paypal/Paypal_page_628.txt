Paypal are still randomly holding payments from buyers on my account. Despite ebay themselves saying they have no relevant reason to hold my payments. When trying to contact paypal i get the same copied and pasted message saying it is to ensure buyers receive the service they paid for despite none of my buyers actually opening disputes over any transaction.\nI have never in my life met such an inept company and how they can justify holding peoples money especially during a time of crisis with the coronavirus going around right now is beyond me.\nPaypal have no reason or logic behind these petty holds. Its not even like they are holding money from transaction totalling 100s of pounds they are now witholding small transactions as little as £6?? What on earth is there actual criteria on deciding what payments to hold?\nPlease i implore you everyone if you can use any other payment method then do so do not use this corrupt company', 'review_date': '2020-03-28', 'review_time': '13:47:05', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
