I decided to use their services to accept payments from clients as many people already have paypal accounts and with the current shutdown orders in place, it seemed like an easy option to continue operating as close to normally as possible. When I tried to accept my first payment through them, everything went wrong. I received a text to "claim" my payment and did so. I got a confirmation page telling me I had claimed it and to go to my Summary page. My summary showed no money received. My Activities page showed nothing. Now, it\'s a new account, so if there had been some type of hold, I could understand, but nothing was showing as pending or held or anything. I tried the self-help section of the site and it did not help. It simply referred to making sure the email used was correct. I contacted their customer service. The rep repeatedly kept referring to maybe my client entered the wrong email, even though my client sent it using my phone number, as the paypal app allows one to do. I received a text with a link to claim and I logged into my paypal business account using the correct email. The rep asked me for the transaction ID and I tried to send 3 times, but their chat system kept blocking some of the digits. I finally had to send it one character at a time. He still could not find it. I had to upload an image of the transaction confirmation. While I was doing retrieving that from my client and saving it in a form that could be uploaded to their chat system, he got impatient and advised he was putting me on hold. He then advised me he still had no idea what happened and advised I have my client cancel the transaction and redo it using a different method. I asked for a supervisor contact because of the time and money this has cost me because I spent 2+ hours on all this and was advised he\'d send my request but couldn\'t guarantee anyone will contact me. Needless to say, I will not be accepting payments through Paypal.', 'review_date': '2020-04-09', 'review_time': '17:37:51', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
