The whole paypal system is designed to screw the sellers.\n\n- Basically any scamer can do a chargeback and paypal wont protect you or your business. DO NOT believe the "buyer protection" - it is all scam. The crapiest thing -scamy buyers know how paypal works and they will use it to their advantage. And paypal ALWAYS will side the buyer no matter what. Basically you can go and buy a rolex. Once you receive the rollex - you can do a chargeback and you will get a rolex and 10000$ back... and the Seller wont be able to do anything! Or you can open a dispute that item is not as described... and then return the seller a brick. The paypal will get your 10000$ imidiately. Thats how it works.\n\n-Also paypal will try to hold your money for as long as possible. They deliberately will lock your account right before Christmas or after Black friday sale or at any time when you generate large turnover. Almost lost my business multiple times because of that. I\'ve noticed those patterns. BTW your account will be locked if you will try to withdraw money.\n\n- Paypal support is almost non-exsitent. Support will copy paste standard messages. There is no phone line. So if you need your money urgently and your account is locked - good luck.\n\n- If you have negative balance, paypal will try to take your money by force so make sure you keep your linked credit or debit card empty or disable it ASAP. Same with your link bank account.\n\n- Multiple paypal ex-workers confirmed the shady practices of Paypal. Its is a well known fact.\n\n- Please use other payment processors if you are starting a business. Or if you have a business - get rid of paypal as soon as possible.', 'review_date': '2021-04-28', 'review_time': '15:48:01', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

The seller had three weeks to reply but never did.\n\nLast week, PayPal\'s automated email prompted me to escalate my claim further. I decided to do that just before the deadline set by PayPal, unfortunately for me the ESCALATION button in PayPal Resolution Centre was not working at that time. I was repetitively logged out of my PayPal account when I hit it. I wish I hadn’t waited until last week to escape my claim but who could have predicted that the PayPal tool designed for escalations would not work at that time. (I have noticed since on PayPal Community Blog that other users reported similar problem, so maybe PayPal is deliberately turning it off before the deadline for users / or is keeping it broken ?!)\n\nSince the mentioned Escalate button was not working for me at the time and my case deadline was approaching I decided to send an email to the PayPal team instead.\n\nAnd here\'s another surprise…. finding an email to customer support! Unfortunately, sending an email to PayPal team is not easy! I managed to send it eventually via different section but that was either missed or went to black hole.\n\nPayPal sent an email after my deadline saying that I have missed the deadline and I cannot escalate my claim anymore :(\nMy further explanations and attempts to open the case didn’t work and this is how I lost my case.\n\nAnother reviewer on TrustPilot wrote that "PayPal is an automated call centre designed to make you go away".
