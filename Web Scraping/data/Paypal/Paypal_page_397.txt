I am not going to explain in details how they screw me, however, I would love to show you how to not fall into their trap.\n1. Cancellation of transactions - it merely does not exist there. You maximum can apply for a partial refund which means you are going to loose some amount anyways.\n2. What they always forget to show you is how much money you would loose by the time the transaction is complete. For instance, the sender would always see the transaction fee as ZERO. However, the receiver gets up to 10% less. (I’m not even sure if it is legal on PayPal’s behalf to not mention the amount that the receiver would get in reality.)\n\nHope you will not become a victims of those thieves. I just feel bad realising that such unethical businesses still exist just because we give them money to operate.', 'review_date': '2021-02-06', 'review_time': '20:56:11', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

My ebay acct was hacked, I found it and reported it to ebay, ten items were listed on my acct that were unauthorized and several purchased were made. Ebay took care of refunds on all but one which was around $572 which was in my Paypal acct. I informed ebay of the purchase and asked if I should just refund the guy, I was told NO, that they were issuing refunds and didnt want to end up with a double refund.\nSo, after ebay finished their investigation, cleared everything I told them the money was still in my PP acct and that I wasn't going to touch it since it wasn't mine. Later PayPal sends me a bill around $40 for fees related to the fraudulent purchase. They finally withdrew the $500 plus from my acct and still wanted me to pay about $40. They were informed of the situation but insisted I owed them, I told them to go to hell and although I still have a PP acct, they will not close it since they say I owe them money.\nSo, PayPal is great until they try to screw you....not me so Paypal can go to hell as far as I'm concerned.
