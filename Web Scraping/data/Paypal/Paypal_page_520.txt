PayPal staff are absolute morons who actively assist criminals committing fraud. The criminals have realised this fact and therefore PayPal fraud is dramatically increasing. As a major global financial institution they have a duty to prevent and fight fraud, but they clearly don't give a damn about their responsibilities as long as they are making money for themselves. I would very strongly advise everyone to find an alternative method of paying for goods because PayPal is appallingly bad and not secure in any way.\nUPDATE\nAfter months of dealing with stupid people on the PayPal webchat service, the day after leaving this review someone from PayPal actually telephoned me. What a remarkable coincidence.\nAnyway, like thousands of others, my wife was the victim of the Chinese scam where you order and pay for a quality item but receive an item of Christmas cracker junk, and PayPal expect you to pay to post this piece of junk back to the criminals in China.\nThis particular PayPal representative has now promised my wife a full refund without the requirement to post the junk back, and said that this particular seller would be investigated to see if they have done anything similar previously.\nWhilst we are grateful for the refund, if it happens, I made it crystal clear that it was not sufficient. It is essential that PayPal stops assisting criminals with their idiotic policies and actually becomes once again a safe place to spend money by protecting the innocent victims instead of the criminals.\nI am far from convinced that anything will come of this, and it will be interesting to see if these identical complaints persist. I have asked to be kept updated with the progress of the investigation, but I will be amazed if I ever hear another word about it.\nWhat I would say to anyone who has suffered the same thing is DO NOT GIVE UP!!\nMy wife was ready to give up as soon as she was told the case had been closed in favour of the criminals. I was not prepared to let it rest and I kept on and on at them until finally they actually agreed to reverse the decision. Unfortunately you have to deal with morons incapable of thinking for themselves and who stick rigidly to the script for quite some time, but eventually you will hopefully make progress if you DEMAND to speak to someone at management level.\nIf enough people keep making a fuss and refuse to give up, maybe eventually they will actually change their moronic policies, re train their brain dead staff, and shut down the PayPal accounts of the criminals.\nI won't be holding my breath though.", 'review_date': '2020-08-29', 'review_time': '11:43:50', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
