Then why the hell did you contact her in the first place? So fast forward, SAME DAY MIND YOU, she contacted her bank for refund because paypal wouldn\'t make it right then closed her bank account to prevent this from happening further since the Hacker had her information. So we call paypal, get transferred 3 times, and get told that the -$355 on the account is owed by her because they refunded her 2× in error (over a month after they denied that the payment was unauthorized to a closed bank account). Have failed to provide documentation showing that a refund was received, spent over two hours on the phone mostly on hold for them to "pacify" saying they will appeal the decision. All to get an email an hour and half later (interesting that it came through at 7 pm when they close at 6 pm) saying that the appeal was denied and she still owes the money! FU*K YOU PAYPAL!
