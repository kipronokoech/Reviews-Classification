We've made a huge mistake and used Paypal to process that payment. And to our surprise, they have put that money on hold for 21 days! For no reason at all. There is nothing that can be done to release it earlier and this is the money I badly need as I just bought a new home. I've just spent 2,5 hrs with their support chat, which was completely useless, unhelpful and who kept contradicting their own advice - I went nowhere with that. So, they not only stole my money and left me with nothing but had no problem charging me 5% of the transaction. In the end, I was advised that 'Well, you'll have to wait 21 days'. Easy to say for such a loaded corporation. Self-employed contractors can't afford to wait almost a month for their money, because Paypal wants to do some dodgy stuff for 21 days with MY money! Moreover, I enquired about me refunding the company the money so they can just transfer it via bank. Thier reply? It takes 5 working days, but for some cards/banks it may be 30... Oh, and they will keep the 5% charge after the refund. So, AVOID by all means. I never liked Paypal, and hardly used it, but now, as soon as this payment comes through I am cancelling my account with these thieves. They stole my money, and couldn't provide me with a straight reason. If I could give zero stars, I would. Awful experience, and even worse service.", 'review_date': '2023-07-20', 'review_time': '16:29:21', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
