PayPal owes my small business a measly $70 because they for no reason refunded my customer without my request or approval, and I cannot get a reissued payment from that customer now but I am still out the product. Paypal has completely washed their hands of it and had the audacity to compare my NOW CLOSED DUE TO COVID DESTRUCTION small business to their multi billion dollar corporation that is still thriving through this pandemic.. as if ours struggles are comparable?! HORRENDOUS. Not to mention I have been writing back and forth for nearly 12 hours now. Every response comes from a different customer service person so none of them really know what is going on, I reply instantly and it takes an hour to hear back again.

I sent my ID, company registration and invoices from my UK supplier proving that I purchased the items. I would even provide proof of payment and further explanations. Instead, the accounts team decided to close my account and make me wait (hopefully) no more than 180 DAYS to (hopefully) get my money FROM MY SALES from which PAYPAL WERE QUICK ENOUGH TO TAKE THEIR FEES and for all of which I HAVE PROVIDED PROOF OF DELIVERY.\n\nNaturally, there is no way to directly contact this account team it seems. It does make sense from PayPal's point of view. If you can't contact this team, then they don't need to fabricate a reason for closing the account.\n\nHolding money for 180 days is a very serious move for PayPal to make. Many people depend on their PayPal accounts being open for their BUSINESS TO SURVIVE. PayPal is single-handedly RUINING BUSINESSES IN AN INSTANT. Many people need the money in their accounts to pay their bills. It is ludicrous that PayPal thinks this is an acceptable way to handle thousands of pounds of hard earned money.\n\nPayPal are quick to take their fees and refund customers instantly, even when tracking has been uploaded to prove delivery.

Their customer service is crap and run by people who can't even speak English which is so frustrating since it's already hard with your current paypal issues when you contact them. 4.
