I was sent something COMPLETELY different to what was advertised, Cost me USD 45. What i received was so cheap that could be bought from a dollar store. The seller was willing to refund just 10$. I raised a case with PayPal. I sent them the pictures and all details of what the seller advertised and the pics of the items I received. There was evidence to prove that I was cheated. After investigating the matter PayPal informed me that the seller was willing to refund in full, but I needed to ship the items back within a week. Only on receipt of the items in good condition would they refund. It was going to cost me over 25AU$ to ship the items back as I had to send them by express courier. PayPal said that I MAY be able to claim the shipping cost, but I needed to take pictures of the items being weighed by the courrier, and then send the pics, tracking details etc. Too complicated. All this was during Christmas/NY season. I informed PayPal that this was not practical, they had the proof required, etc. And also I was not going to risk spending more money. Long story short, PayPal just informed me that since I did not send the tracking number I have lost my case.\nThis is just a long story short. It was extremely difficult to get PayPal to respond to my queries. I tried calling them several times, each time on the phone for over 45 mts and got no one on the phone. We will never use PayPal again. I read several similar complaints. Even when they have proof that the seller is a fraud, they still seem to support them.', 'review_date': '2021-01-09', 'review_time': '13:06:46', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
