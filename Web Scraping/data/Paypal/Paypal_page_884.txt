PayPal does not provide buyer protection for what they call "intangible" items or "intangible" deficiencies. PayPal used that excuse to avoid assisting me in reclaiming $80 from an online seller despite clear evidence that the product involved has serious deficiencies and there have been prior claims and evidence. PayPal simply did nothing to "investigate" the claim - they simply closed the case as being "intangible". Software is not intangible - it has to exist as code, it has to be measurable in operation and function, and it does or does not provide features that it claims. These are easily determined as true or false. My complaint was not about any intangible aspect of the product - it was clearly that there is a major flaw in the software and clear evidence that this flaw causes significant operational issues such that I could not and would not trust using the product.\n\nA software vendor could simply send you garbage and you will have no recourse through PayPal for obtaining a refund. Since PayPal is a very common payment method for foreign vendors, independent developers and many smaller software producers this becomes a huge risk for the consumer. Many software products such as browser plugins, WordPress plugins and independent apps are only payable via PayPal - for good reason - once you have paid you are on your own and all the evidence in the world that the product you purchased is flawed will not convince PayPal to take any action on behalf of the buyer (as long as they are making their cut of the sales, they have no incentive to chastise sellers for selling garbage and no reason to support refunds to buyers). Once PP has decided against you in any claim there is no opportunity for rebuttal, appeal or additional evidence to support your claims - something they do not make clear from the outset; users are lead to believe there is a process, but in fact once the seller responds you likely have no further opportunity to contribute.', 'review_date': '2015-07-11', 'review_time': '18:57:17', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
