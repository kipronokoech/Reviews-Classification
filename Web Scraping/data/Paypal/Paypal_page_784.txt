My mother had an account with them but was very unfamiliar with the process, so we called customer service.

While making an account, I put in my date of birth and social security number, as well as all my financial information. made an account and hadn’t started selling anything. In 2016, I started selling and buying online. I was eighteen at that time.\nI developed a successful business online that only supported PayPal. In March of 2017, I got the dreaded permanent account limitation (ban.) I was told that giving all the information to them, I would most likely get my account back. I appealed severely times but was denied. It devastated my business to say the very least. They destroyed me.\nTwo years later, my mom received the same email. She’s a 58-year-old woman who occasionally purchased arts and crafts online. They accused her of being affiliated with me due to our address since my address was on my account and they linked it. The appeal was denied even though they had no given reason, like a transaction ID.\nThey don’t investigate and are completely irrational when it comes to account limitations. My ability to sell online is over because of a misinformed customer service representative. While appeal was denied, they said I could not cancel my account since they didn’t want me to make account, which is rational. They promised me that they would not be using my information, yet used my information to ban my moms account. Trustworthy and reliable when it comes to making money and keeping messes behind closed doors but don’t really care about peoples online businesses, which was shocking to me at the time.\n\nUPDATE: After I left this review, I got an email from PayPal letting me know that a phone number was added to my account. (The one I called them from / was already on my account.) They said they wouldn\'t use any information given since my account was "basically" closed.

A few months ago a friend of mine scammed me into sending him gift money. He was planning on giving me a dog so I sent the money as gratitude. As you are already assuming, I never got the dog and lost $400. Being a college student, trying to fend her own, this really hit the floor of my bank. I live pay check to pay check. I called paypal customer service and they were very helpful, they told me to file a claim through my bank, and then have my bank send that claim to their bank. I filled out the forms EXACTLY as the customer service staff had instructed, sent it in, and WEEKS later got a response from paypal saying they were not going to return the money. This was terribly frustrating because the customer service lady said this happened to people all the time, and that I would be able to get my money back. So when Paypal said "no, you authorized that charge so we wont give you your money back even though it was stolen" I cried my eyes out. Losing that $400 hurt my credit pretty bad, my friend kept promising he would return the money so until then I was living off my credit card, assuming I could pay it off real fast once he gave the money back. So little by little I got into debt, and it was too late when I realized I was never getting that money back that I had filed the claim (it was past the 60 days). I think paypal is great, it has a lot of benefits. But I am sadly disappointed in the greediness of their bank for simply not returning $400 to a small broke girl, when you know they have billions in that big bank of theirs. I wouldnt recommend using paypal to send gift money, use venmo instead.', 'review_date': '2018-10-28', 'review_time': '01:06:07', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

I have used it for personal purchases and have integrated it into many websites over the years, all without much of a problem until the past two years.\n\nI have had issues with my personal account where I couldn\'t change my email address and other details and couldn\'t access my money for days. It finally got resolved over the course of several phone calls lasting at least 30 minutes each.\n\nMy bank doesn\'t have as many "security features" as PayPal like to boast about (which aren\'t really features, more flaws in an otherwise decent system).\n\nAs irritating as the issue with my personal account was, it pales into insignificance compared to the issues I have had to face over the past 48 hours.\n\nI was setting up PayPal on a Magento 2 website for a client who has been using PayPal on OpenCart for 5 years without a hitch when I encountered an issue I haven\'t experienced with previous Magento installations.\n\nI setup PayPal Website Payments Standard and logged into PayPal to set up new API credentials for the Magento installation, which I have done numerous times for clients, all without any issue. This time, PayPal decided that it needed to verify the account details despite obviously logging in with the correct credentials provided from the client.\n\nIt asked to verify the account by text message, which I tried to do, but unbelievably PayPal wouldn\'t let me send it to the Primary Mobile number held on the account. I had to get the account holder, my client, to call them to recitify this issue as it wouldn\'t let me update the number.\n\nMy client updated the number and verified the account, so I tried again to get the API credentials set up and the exact same thing happened. I had to ring my client again to inform them they would have to once more call PayPal to sort this out. I asked my client to delegate authority to me to speak to PayPal directly and they said they would.\n\nThis is when PayPal started exposing themselves to be nothing more than liars. The person my client spoke to said they couldn\'t accept the delegated authority and that I would have to physically be there with the client in order to speak to them, which is incorrect in the UK as the Data Protection Act 1998 offers the facility to delegate authority to a named person.\n\nMy client struggled to explain the issue to the lady who appeared to not understand English properly, so had to speak to someone else. Eventually, the account was verified (again) and I once more tried to log in and the same thing happened again.\n\nAt this point my client and I were getting annoyed at the lack of help from PayPal for such a simple issue. We finally got to speak to someone who actually confirmed they could speak to me on delegated authority and I rang them directly to speak to them about the issue.\n\nThey had the nerve to claim that the issue was absolutely nothing to do with them and suggested that I speak to Magento to resolve this issue. I pointed out that I had done several tests on Magento, not to mention numerous other integrations using Magento and PayPal, and that the tests clearly showed it was an authentication problem at their end.\n\nThey finally conceded that there was a "security lock" on the account and said they had overridden this lock and that it should now work.\n\nThey were wrong. Again.\n\nThe exact same thing happened and I had to escalate the complaint to the technical team as my client was past the deadline to launch the website due to PayPal\'s issue. Amazingly, the technical team said, and I quote "As mush [sic] as we\'d like to help you, this is not a PayPal issue, but a third party configuration problem. We don\'t support third party solutions, we don\'t develop their modules or have access to its configuration/code."\n\nBearing in mind that PayPal is the official payment gateway integrated into Magento, it is pure nonsense that they wouldn\'t be able to assist with a module they were directly involved in creating for Magento.\n\nI called them out on this obvious lie, and heard nothing back so I had to call them for the 5th of 6th time. Again, they failed to help out and insisted it wasn\'t their problem.\n\nI ran further tests on Magento and obtained indisputable evidence that the issue was with PayPal\'s API yet they still denied any responsibility, at which point I escalated the issue as I had now been locked out of using the API for 3 days and this was the only thing holding up the launch of the client\'s website.\n\nOn the final phonecall with them I spoke first to one of the customer support people and she claimed that the account was locked and that they couldn\'t override it and I had to wait a further 24 hours before it became unlocked. I asked her when this would be but she didn\'t know. I asked her if it was a joke because the account lock had previously been overridden not 12 hours earlier by one of her colleagues. She said it wasn\'t a joke, at which point I asked to speak to someone who had authority to deal with escalating this issue.\n\nShe passed me on to a chap called "Daniel" and he claimed to be a manager. I reiterated the preposterous claim that they couldn\'t override the lock and he denied that they could. I told him to point out where in their terms and conditions it specified that this lock would come into force and he said it wasn\'t in their T&Cs but was an "internal security feature". I informed him that his was against the law and represented a breach of contract which would render PayPal liable for any losses and damages from the client (who was losing hundreds of pounds each day this issue dragged on).\n\nHe simply repeated they couldn\'t do anything about it at all, despite acknowledging his colleague had, in fact, overridden the exact same lock not 12 hours previously. I told him it was against the client\'s SLA and he appeared to not know what an SLA was, so I asked him and he hesitated before someone in the background whispered "Service Level Agreement", which he duly repeated.\n\nI told him that this was thoroughly unacceptable and that I wasn\'t prepared to waste any more time trying to resolve this issue and that I would instead recommend that the client used an alternative provider, which, in the end, we did and got set up in less than an hour.\n\nI am honestly shocked at how bad PayPal has become, and the level of patronisation they subject me to was unreal. I am a professional software developer with over 10 years\' experience of developing websites and web applications, which have included sophisticated anti-fraud systems, and not once have I come across a system in which security couldn\'t be overridden with someone of sufficient authority.\n\nIt just doesn\'t happen because who in their right mind would allow an account to be locked for 24 hours with no means of unlocking it? Even my bank doesn\'t do that, and they are more heavily regulated than PayPal.\n\nAfter this incident, and reading the scathing reviews on here (which I never thought I would see the likes of considering how good PayPal used to be), I will never use PayPal again because it is clear that they condone staff lying to customers and displaying a general, wilful ignorance of the law in the countries in which they operate.\n\nI would avoid like the plague and use a company which is interested in providing a streamlined experience for their customers. We opted to use Stripe and the ease with which it was integrated was amazing (and like PayPal used to be before it got too big for its boots). I also recommend using WorldPay as their integration is excellent although you do have to jump through more hoops with them.\n\nRIP PayPal and may you reap what you sow.', 'review_date': '2018-10-26', 'review_time': '19:51:51', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
