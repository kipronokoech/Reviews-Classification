First seller didn't want to reimburse the full price (I bought a dress for 51$ with shipping and they want to return only 17$ after I will ship them an item), after I said no to this, they didn't want to give their return address in English. The other seller was especially ridiculous, they put lots of items on their website and after you purchase it, you'll never get an e-mail notification, tracking number or anything. Literary you are just sending someone money on their PayPal buying fake stuff. Both of this purchases where reimbursed for me with Pay Pal in full amount.
