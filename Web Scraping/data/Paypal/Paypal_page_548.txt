They did not explain their mistake at all, but instead emailed me saying my account balance is negative and that I owe them $250.\nI tried contacting their customer service. They are basically non-existent. When you say "Speak to a Representative" it asks for all of this account information then says it cannot find the account. Then when you finally are on hold to "get through to a real person" the automated voice tells you that no one is available to answer phones at this time and suggests you place an inquiry in the help section on their website.\n\nThe "help" center on the website is very buggy. When I try to input a request, I get a screen that says "Something Went Wrong" and I am unable to contact PayPal any other way.\n\nSo I decided to message some of their higher-up employees on LinkedIn and was finally given a direct contact in ENGLAND to discuss my issue. (BTW I found out I was charged for international calls for this conversation).\n\nFINALLY they "figured out" that they had refunded me twice so I did, in fact, "owe" them $250, which I had not noticed and spent already on groceries for the week. I could not afford to pay them and my rent so after explaining the situation over TEN TIMES on the phone to different representatives, I finally was able to tell collections that I could pay them on my next pay day.\n\nThere was no follow-up after receiving my payment and I just shut down my account for good.\n\nMoral of the story: THIS COMPANY SUCKS DO NOT USE THEM.', 'review_date': '2020-07-23', 'review_time': '18:52:11', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
