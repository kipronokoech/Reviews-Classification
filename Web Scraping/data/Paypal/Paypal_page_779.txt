I attempted to send my sister money via paypal for an emergency. Turns out, you don\'t have an option as to how your money is sent after you click "send". I tried this and immediately found out it was going to be processed as an "echeck" transaction instead of an immediate transfer. I immediately contacted paypal customer service to cancel the payment as we were going to attempt a different transaction to get her money sooner than the 3-5 business days they told me would it would take for her to receive these funds. They told me they cannot cancel this transaction as it is an echeck transaction. I informed them I didn\'t choose this option, that\'s just how it was processed. They said I would have to contact my bank to stop the payment (and of course incur stop payment fees from my financial institution). I contacted my bank who proceeded to tell me they cannot stop an echeck transaction as they have no idea what check number to "stop" because it could be presented to them any number of ways...so back to paypal I go. I was literally told I would have to wait 3-5 days for the money to be sent to my sister...she has to refuse the funds....and ANOTHER 3-5 days for it to be sent back to me. So, this morning all the money I sent her is no longer in my account....and it still shows a pending transaction to her so she has not received the funds either....so there is no way for me to get her the help she needed, my funds are gone and she has nothing. The 3 different service reps I spoke to at paypal all gave me different information, I was told no supervisor/manager was available to speak to, that I would have to wait up to 24 hours for a call-back from anyone and yet my money is gone.

If that isn\'t enough, after about 2 years now about every week pay pal freezes out my account, doesnt send me a link via email or text or verify any of my information, not even when I contact them by phone and talk with an inept customer service representative. They\'ll just tell you your account is suspended but give you no reason. I order 40 items on ebay in one day once. 2 days later my pay pal account is suspended and I get an email saying my password was changed (?) but I did not change it nor would it allow me to by any method. Again, nothing could be done to verify my account despite all my information being accurate. Pay Pal operates like it is run by people in 7th grade or are developmentally disabled. I don\'t benefit from using this service whatsoever. They only create issues. I have no reason to call someone or go through constant hoops just to order something I could on my debit or credit card without pay pal. If you value your time , why spend hours of your life on the phone, trying to change your password every week just to use a service that obviously does not value it\'s "customers" or cannot run a business properly. Companies who only use pay pal as a service online don\'t deserve your business. I am sure they know of the issues but must not care. You can make these purchases elsewhere. If there is any actual problem you encounter you are fooling yourself if you think these clowns will be able to solve it when they cannot even allow you to use the account you created. Don\'t expect them to resolve any issues involving money. That would be another headache altogether. How pay pal remains in business is a mystery to me.
