We share a child together and I depend on her to bring my child to me on a yearly basis, as I cannot travel to the states because I do not have a Visa. I use PayPal to send money to her to maintain our child on a monthly basis and for any other miscellaneous expenses I need to cover on behalf of my daughter. My "wife" and I had planned for her to visit me with my daughter and we agreed to split expenses right down the middle, with PayPal being the platform used. My wife was supposed to book the flight and I agreed to reimburse half of the money (Sent via PayPal) and I would book a hotel stay in my home country and she would reimburse half of the money (also sent via PayPal). Now we booked both the Hotel and the Flight months in advance we so get the best rates, and it so happened that my "wife" and myself were at odds before the trip was to take place, and she decided to be petty and filed a false dispute against me on their platform stating that she paid for goods and services she didn\'t receive. I responded to her dispute by escalating the case to a claim and provided all necessary evidence to PayPal support to show that the dispute was false. I paid $1040 from my own pocket to book the hotel and she sent me back $520 on PayPal. She disputed the charges because she wanted to cancel the whole trip and keep my kid away from me in USA, knowing I am not able to travel there. I uploaded the booking details of the Hotel stay showing CLEARLY 2 adults one child, oh and by the way the hotel stay is non-refundable. I also uploaded our marriage certificate, showing that me and the supposed "buyer that didn\'t receive their goods" are married. There is also a paper trail of consistently sending money to the "buyer" for our child\'s needs, all of which I noted down in my escalation to PayPal support, along with detailed screenshots of conversations with me and her where she admits that she is filing a fraudulent dispute against me because she is upset about an argument we had. I also sent in proof of our conversations where she agreed to reimburse me half the money back. And this company took all this evidence, and proceeded to refund my wife all the money, leaving me with a negative balance on my PayPal account charged for a supposed strike against my account, and also leaving me out $1040 for a booking for me, a woman, and a child, that will not be showing up, that is not refundable. I called in their support team (which seems to be based in the Philippines) and went at great lengths to explain this case to them over and over and 3 different occasions. Not withstanding that the contact center is based in the Philippines, on several occasions they tried to refuse me any assistance because I am not located in the US myself, and I had to get crazy and refuse to leave the line for them to even look into my case. I tried a total of three times to re-open this case and get them to do the right thing and all I received were promises that they understand and see that I deserve for the dispute to be reversed, and a rude supervisor who told me point blank she doesn\'t care about me and my wife (even though they enabled a false dispute on their platform, which is FRAUD). You\'re better off putting money in a sock and sending it in a suitcase overseas, or using Western Union. This is a complete incompetent sham of a Company that discriminates against people that do not live in the USA, even though we ALL pay to use the platform. You deserve -5 stars but that option doesn\'t exist unfortunately, so try ONE on for size, and you will be hearing from my legal team in short order.', 'review_date': '2023-05-02', 'review_time': '14:41:40', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
