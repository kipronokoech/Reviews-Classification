As a seller small business I ship my items with untracked regular mail I have been on Ebay for 10 years for no problem with buyers and nowadays the policies that they urge to sellers like pay return shipping if buyer makes fraudulent claim they always stay at buyers side and urge you to pay all fees.In my case buyer opened a return request as not as described because they chose it and they didn't like the colour I have explained them the case is not as descriubed and if they don't like they must pay return shipping and will get refund so buyer closed case on Ebay.Then opened case on Paypal stated item not received and I uploaded the return request screenshot from Ebay they have closed and explained them they have received the order and they abuse the resolution and escalated to Paypal. Like always Paypal doesn't care you they only look for tracking code they stayed at buyer favor even though it was clearly they have received and refunded the buyer. I have stopped from today selling on Ebay and working with Paypal! The Paypal is very bad service for sellers as they see us like slaves of the buyers' fraudulent claims.Stay away they have very expensive conversion rates and high fees also and I am not surprısed that they have such a bad feedback ın here trustpilot.Stay away from them use any other service or platform to sell", 'review_date': '2020-02-26', 'review_time': '13:04:56', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
