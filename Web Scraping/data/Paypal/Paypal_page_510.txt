They then provided me with a FAKE email address to contact to find out why my account was banned. I attempted to contact them @askpaypal twitter, to which they ignored me. So i called them up again today and asked the same questions. I was told my account was limited because of a verification issue. I then asked them why they where holding my funds for 180 days and they told me because of buyer seller disupte on ebay. which is Nonsense.
