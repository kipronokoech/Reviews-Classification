That was until they refused to delete my social security information. I created a personal account to sell some stuff on eBay and when I started receiving money in, from items that I had sold on eBay, they required me to provide my social security information before they would allow me to have access to my money. They held my money hostage so they could get my social security information. Not too long after this, I had some stuff pop up on my credit monitoring reports. When I called to complain about the fraud, the credit companies asked me if I recently provided my social security number to anyone or any company. Within that time frame PayPal was the only company that had requested (I mean forced me to provide it to them by holding my money hostage) I was so upset, the next day I called PayPal and told them to remove my social security information from my account because of the fraudulent stuff that was popping up on my credit reports. They PayPal associate told me that this was impossible, I asked for their supervisor and they refused to transfer me and hung up on me. I called back and finally got a hold of a supervisor by lying to a PayPal associate about what I wanted to talk to the supervisor about. When the supervisor got on the phone, I explained my problems and asked them to remove my social security information from their database. He told me that this was impossible and the only thing I could do was to close my account. I said, "Ok, close my account." He then told me that even if I close my account they will still retain all of my data including my social security information in their database. I have since spent thousands of dollars trying to rebuild and re-establish my credit score.\n\nLet me make it simple.

I also used eBay to buy lots of things at great prices. This was until I sent about $800 worth of comic books to a buyer who won an auction. I don't care if my items sell for $20 or $1,000 - I always shipped my items via FedEx or UPS with insurance, tracking information and a signature required upon receipt. I did all of this to ensure the safest shipping method possible. Well this guy who received and signed for the comics, claimed that I sent him fake comics. (I don't even know what a fake comic is) He opens a dispute with PayPal and I very easily provided the tracking number with delivery confirmation, I also provided his signature for the receipt of said item and PayPal ruled in his favor anyway. I contacted PayPal and they assured me that I would not have to provide a refund until I received my comics back, so I agreed that was fair. The buyer sent me a package pack that contained a dirty used puppy pad (the things dog pee and poop on inside an apartment or house) I documented it with photos and sent them to PayPal. However, since he paid the extra $1 or whatever for tracking, PayPal awarded him my $800 Back! SO NOT ONLY DID THIS GUY GET $800 OF MY MONEY, HE ALSO GOT MY $800 WORTH OF COMICS!
