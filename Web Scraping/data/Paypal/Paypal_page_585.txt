He sent them and gave me tracking number and sent me and address to return them tracking number worked at first but when I tried to track item again track number was removed and seller removed his email address. The charge was on my credit card april 10. Because I had no way to contact seller I immediately contacted PP to file a claim so I could recover my 29.00$per PP agreement. Well I guess PP failed to do their job. I tried several times in several ways to get my money back but to no avail because I received the run around you need to do this no you need to do that. And of course none of it worked. Terrible terrible customer service. I lost track of number of PP reps I talked to about my claim and no one advised mr that PP failed to file a claim. So they closed my case and I've been told there is nothing they can do to re open my claim and return my 29.00$.
