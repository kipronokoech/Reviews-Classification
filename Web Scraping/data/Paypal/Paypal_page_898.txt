An hour later he was told he would remain without access for 7 days. My red flags were screaming loud so I went to PayPal and charged back the purchase. After all, he no longer had access to the site and server. When my chargeback was filed, they reported that due to their No Tattling policy, he would be banned for life.

Their offers of Seller and Buyer protection are fraudulent. A customer contacted me to purchase a dress from my store and wanted it sent to Australia. She paid by Paypal. Once she receives the dress she immediately files with Paypal to get her money back and Paypal removes the entire amount of money from my account automatically. It cost $45 to send the dress to her b/c she wanted express delivery. That amount was also removed even though the post office has that money now not me. So Paypal says customer filed dispute and they are holding the money. Even though I don't offer refunds on formal wear, I just had near the same experience with another buyer that they filed a dispute and then returned a used and damaged dress back and still got their full money back even though I had to go get a notary and file papers with Paypal. I eventually got my money back on that one though, but I think they did as well. So I decided on this one I would just agree to refund the cost of the dress minus shipping since, as I said, that money went to the post office. So I offered a $195 refund. She accepted the refund and Paypal automatically gave her the money back rather than holding the money until she proved she mailed the dress. She immediately went on our Facebook page and left us a message that she was not sending the dress back.. So I call Paypal and let them know and they say nothing they can do! As if they can't just go in and debit her account as they did mine. Believe me Paypal will go in your account and take money out anytime they want, I have had it done several times. If no money is in the Paypal account they just give you a negative balance and let you know they will be removing that amount from whatever account you have linked to your Paypal account. So I said you are supposed to protect me to as the seller I was just agreeing to the return process which you encourage members to do and pretty much force it since you had already debited my account for the full amount. Now since she has the money I am pretty much like the buyer who did not receive the item I payed for. Still no help. Nothing they can do! Really where else can this happen? I can't buy a refrigerator from Best Buy then go in there and say I want my money back but I am also going to keep the refrigerator. Business owners it is so tempting to accept Paypal when you have a willing buyer but don't do it as you are giving up all of your rights and your return policy means nothing.
