I claimed that to PayPal and were asked to send it to eBay Luxemburg and I would pay for the shipment. I couldn\'t beleive that I would send the item to another country, I checked the address on Google Maps and it was a regular house in Luxemburg, it didn\'t look like an office. I contacted eBay Germany and it was very strange they said. I Contacted PayPal several times and they tried to force me to send it to Luxemburg, until last day one agent gave me "correct" address in Germany. I sent the item back to the seller, the package never arrived and was sent back to me because of wrong address.\n\nBecause the package never arrived, I lost my money and had paid extra for the shipment. PayPal closed the case. I called and told them that I did as they said, it was really hard to me to convince them that I did as they said and followed the instructions in details, it didn’t help. I called several times until one agent took it seriously and went through the files that I had attached; he reopened the case and asked the decision makers to take another look into the attached files. Apparently, PayPal avoided the info I provided them about the track ID and photos of everything and just closed the case. It was then, after the case was reopened and what the agent wrote to decision makers helped me to be refunded.\n\nSummer 2022:\nI purchased a lot of items from a store, one of the items was out of stock and would be shipped later wrote the store, the item costs around €60. And in the store\'s ad they ”promised” one free additional item worth around €40 when a backpack was purchased which I did.\n\nI received everything except the item out of stock which was expected, and the "free" addtional item was missing. The store said it’s only for local customers which the didn’t mention it in their ad. I claimed that to PayPal, the store first agreed to refund then asked to send back the items that I purchased. PayPal asked me to send back the items worth around 500€ to get my 100€ for the two missed items (the one I paid for and the free one). I asked them to read the conversation between me and the store which I had attached, they refused to do it. I told the agent about previous case in winter 2021 that was reopened, it seems your are not browsing the files that I\'m attaching? The answer was no, the case is closed, contact the store instead. I lost 100€ because of them.\n\nNever ever PayPal!', 'review_date': '2022-10-05', 'review_time': '22:21:18', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
