Customer orders in the knowledge that orders take 3 weeks to make and delivery. Our manufacturer will not make these until they receive payment. Once manufacture commences, there is a minimum 20% of cost penalty for cancellation. Product is in excess of $2000. After payment and one week later a customer decides to cancel the order. Customer knows there will be a penalty so goes to PayPal to inform them goods have not been delivered. The situation is explained to PayPal and within 48 hours they decide to ‘steal’ the payment from our bank account and refund the customer leaving us over $400 loss in payment to our manufacturer.\nSeems impossible to make any appeal and makes it impossible for businesses like ours to trust this business.\nPayPal are typical of a large organization with such a strong monopolistic- type grip on the on-line payment market that they do as they please. Would strongly advise any seller to stay away from PayPal if at all possible. They have no interest in understanding your business and refuse to negotiate,\nI’ve had other disputes with PayPal where it is extremely difficult to understand how we could be in the wrong.

I’m done with PayPal and I tell anyone reading to proceed using them with caution. They are tracking every payment, every purchase, and they will send it to the IRS.
