Why pay large fees and receive terrible customer service too? We used Paypal for a while everything was going ok, then they decided to initiate closing our account (something to do with risks during the COVID 19 epidemic) with over £2000 in the account! We might add that when they decided to do this, we had zero pending cases on the account, so this was completely unjustified. Obviously, while the account was locked we could no longer withdraw money, this meant it caused problems with cash flow which is particularly important as a new business. WE MIGHT ADD THEY CAN LOCK YOUR ACCOUNT AT ANY TIME THEY WANT, even if the only thing that has changed is you had increased sales!!! Avoid Paypal like the plague, if you use them as a payment provider for your business you will only regret it.', 'review_date': '2020-05-05', 'review_time': '13:14:13', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

Meanwhile noticed I haven’t received my shoes and dresses. So I contacted PayPal and follow up they said yes you got your shoes based on our record and guess what!! The fake and scam company sent me the Hoodie to keep the record of the shipping! That website was not exist anymore and they completely disappeared. I explained to PayPal several times but they totally ignored my request. I’m trying to report this case to media and take PayPal to court since this third party in USA should be responsible for us, not to protect the scammer. So far after several attempts PayPal didn’t do ANYTHING. PayPal is not behind their customers they protect the scammers even I took a picture of everything with proof but still they ignored me.\nHorrible horrible customer service and company.

Jesus Wept, what a fiasco. It began by a buyer on eBay paying me £100 (via paypal) for 2 stereo speakers. Unfortunately he read the ad wrong. He thought it was free postage. No, collection only. I immediately reversed the payment and thought that was that. Not so. Not by a million miles. Paypal got back to me and said 'Oh, we deduct £3 for the transaction ( thanks, at least Richard Turpin wore a mask ! ) That leaves just £97, and so, we must issue an 'echeck' I'd never heard of an echeck. I just thought it was another way of scamming more money out of me. I raged at paypal, What the Hell is an echeck?. Why not take the money out of my linked bank account? I must have contacted over 7 different people, or more likely, computer sprites, not real people at all and no one could sort it out. The buyer wasn't happy either. I demanded paypal stop their echeck and pay the buyer at once, as by now I had over £200 in my paypal account, plus something like £2000 in the bank account I use with paypal. Oh no Sir, we can't do that, we've started the process, so you will have to wait for it to finish. 2 weeks and it hadn't finished. I contacted my bank and they had never heard of an 'echeck' The said it all sounds dodgy to them and they would block anything that came from paypal that said echeck. Nothing ever came in. Utter tosh if you ask me. Then suddenly, 10 days into this fiasco, paypal suddenly took £100 out of my Halifax bank account. They now had £100 of mine and £100 of the buyers money too. I was arguing the toss with sprites for hours. I sent a formal complaint into paypal but still the sprites got through, wanting me to tell them the whole story again and again. 15 days and hours online, trying to sort it out and I get a message this morning from paypal, Your echeque payment has cleared... Every other communication with them, they called it an echeck. Today it's an echeque. Whatever. I'm just waiting for verification from the buyer that he's got his money back. Christ, I hope so.\nPaypal, your not fit for purpose. You couldn't run a drinking contest in a brewery and you don't give a toss about your customers.
