I informed PayPal that the business isn't what they claim, they're scammers, that the number they have listed on the website belongs to an insurance company and the rep told me they've been getting calls in asking if they're Sidedicatedashop. PayPal closed my case favor the seller i had to get my bank involved. \n\n\nAbout the scam business:\n\nThis business is a scam i ordered a drill from them and these people sent something that weighs 10 ounces. For one i never even received the package i paid $59.99, how i know the package weighs 10 ounces.... i called the post office after these people gave PayPal a tracking number because i called PayPal letting them know this is scammers don't release my money to them. After i bought the supposed to be drill something told me to call the number they have on the site. That number belongs to an insurance company. After learning this that's when i called PayPal, that's when this scammer gave a tracking number and sent the package to an address i don't live at. PayPal released my money to them closed my case favor to the seller. This when i got my bank involved.
