I bought clothes from an online clothing company just for fashion, when I received them they were poor quality and not as described on website and made of very poor quality, when I ordered it said nothing of the return address being in China, I contacted the company and there customer service was appalling and didn’t reply to my emails, I got PayPal involved as you have customer protection!!!!!! What a load of garbage. PayPal advised me to send the goods back at my own expense with tracking information which I did, by Royal Mail sent PayPal the tracking details and photographs of the parcel with the tracking information all over it. Received an email from PayPal thanking me for the tracking information and they would give the seller 30 days to reply. Now after 30 days PayPal are denying my refund because I didn’t send tracking information??????? Even though I have an email from them thanking me for the tracking information!!!!!!! I have sent many emails with the proof again asking for an explanation of why they sent me an email thanking me for the tracking information if they didn’t receive it?? I get the same automated response reply every time, saying they know it is not the outcome I expected and they will note my objection!! WHAT ?? This company are scamming me as much as the company I bought the clothes from, and now because of PayPal I am £74 out of pocket', 'review_date': '2019-09-13', 'review_time': '05:17:43', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

Just recently we sold a vintage gold watch through Shpock. The buyer asked us to request his money through Paypal and gave us his Paypal name...all this conversation was done through the Shpock messaging service...at no time did we give this man our email address or telephone numbers. We did as asked thinking that this was the safest way...so we duly requested payment. The Paypal site said pending + £1500 which to us looked like the money was there but waiting to be transferred into my account. We then started to get emails from Paypal to say that the money was waiting for transfer. We then sent the watch to the buyer through Royal Mail. But after we sent the watch another email came through from Paypal to say that the payment would be delayed due to their website being 'down'..alarm bells rang and I promptly rang Paypal to clarify the truth of this. It took me ages just to find a contact number. When I did the gentleman on the other end was not very helpful. It transpired eventually that we had been scammed.\nHe was very unsympathetic...but I blame Paypal for the scam because it came to light that they had given the scammer my email address when requesting the money...hence the emails. If we hadn't received these emails the watch would not have been sent. As I said before at NO time did we divulged our personal email accounts to this scammer and only when Paypal gave it to him did the scam start. The Paypal staff member told us that 'this is what they do' and it was our fault for not realising that the emails were not from paypal...how were we to know this is what they did. I have tried to contact a complaints department or find an email address to write a letter of complaint and I cannot find any. In fact since that call...and I log into my account... and then go to contact it is a blank white page...and yet I can get into any other parts of the site without trouble...are they blocking me! To summarise: The scammer knew that he could get this sort of information from Paypal and also that the Paypal request money page is confusing to some so took advantage of this. Shpock has also found out that this scammer has done the same thing before on other occasions. PayPal is answerable for this...but cover themselves so well!
