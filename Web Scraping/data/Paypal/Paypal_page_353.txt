I USED THEM FOR GETTING PAYMENTS FROM SELLING ONLINE AND ONE DAY THEY BLOCKED MY ACCESS TO AN ACCOUNT. AT THE SAME TIME I RECEIVED A MESSAGE, STATING THAT MY FUNDS WOULD BE HELD FOR THE NEXT 180 DAYS - PERSONALLY, I DO NOT BELIEVE THEY\'LL EVER BE RETURNED TO ME. TRUSTED THIS COMPANY FULLY AND EVENTUALLY GOT ROBBED. THEY HAVE LITERALLY BROKEN MY LIFE - I MOVED OUT OF MY APARTMENT, DUE TO NOT BEING ABLE TO PAY FOR IT AND AM CURRENTLY STARVING FOR THE LAST 2 MONTHS!!! ________________________________________________________________________ How this all started? One day I decided to dedicate my whole time to selling online and have chosen a company called Paypal as a means of receiving the payments. I would say that this happened because of their advertisements stating that your money gonna be 100% secure and I could never imagine that it`s an absolute lie which is aimed to attract more and more future victims. What is more, I have never thought how my cooperation with them would end up - believe me, in my place you would beg it to be a nightmare. So, as I already stated, I opened an account on their website - "paypal.com" and slowly, but confidently began to gain success in selling clothes, mainly on eBay. After some period of time, it went so well, that I invested all of my funds in a process. Of course, there were sometimes delays on the side of a supplier due to the items being out of stock and I had to issue refunds, but I`ve never had single negative feedback. After a few months, I came to 8500USD in income and decided that it would not be a bad decision to withdraw a little of my funds, mainly for household purposes - entered a webpage, as usual, tried to make a transfer, but instead saw: "Your account access is permanently limited. After a review, we\'ve decided to permanently limit your account due to potential risk. You’ll not be able to conduct any further business using PayPal." That`s all the information I got and, of course, was not able to withdraw any single cent. After that, I faced problems in paying eBay selling fees, as they are also not being able to access my funds and, as a result, they would make collections from the incomes that I can`t even withdraw from Paypal. Think twice before dealing with this company, they gonna make you homeless!!!\nReference ID: PP-L-257409768351', 'review_date': '2021-04-12', 'review_time': '19:06:00', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
