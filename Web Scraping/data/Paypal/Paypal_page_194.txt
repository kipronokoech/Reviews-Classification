I've been using PayPal a few years but not as long as five years. I should have raised the dispute with my card provider, but at the time I made the transaction through PayPal. I can't rate them well, because the transaction was at the beginning of May, now in mid June and after escalating I'm still waiting!!! But seeing money has been taken and no item recieved receipt or tracking and a customer service email that changes each time its contacted... it feels very much like thefts and mugging. I've decided not to use PayPal after this, reason the ordeal, and they have the illusion that all is well in the online shopping world free from scammers and foul practice, however that isn't realistic and really doesn't give the customer the option to challenge. The amount was a small sum, fortunately its been a lesson. However, I don't make the habit of giving money away to scammers or online cons for the sake of it. I won't be using PayPal I don't think they are customer friendly and for purpose I don't think they qualify.", 'review_date': '2022-06-14', 'review_time': '15:39:27', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
