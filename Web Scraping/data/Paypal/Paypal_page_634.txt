I would give 0 stars if it was possible. I would compare PP to modern day thieves that prefer to hide behind 800-page company policies rather than help customers out. I truly believe they are up to something with their entire user database of funds.\n\nAfter making Â£3,000 in ebay sales, they locked our account. After many frantic inquiries as to why and 3 weeks of inconsistent, on-and-off waiting for messages and replies and being transferred to approximately 20 different webchat agents in the process, we are still awaiting "their dedicated team to review our situation", even after supplying them with every document in our name.\n\nWe still haven\'t gained access to our money and we are now in the 4th week of waiting, calling and inconsistent messaging. We are now hiring legal help to put this through UK courts as a matter of principle than anything else.\n\nOurs is part of a business account and quite fortunately, we don\'t need to rely on this cash yet, but I believe it is likely that people\'s lives DEPEND on gaining access to their accounts that PAYPAL have LOCKED... this is a total failure of their customer service.\n\nI am unsure as to why this hasn\'t flagged up on any financial regulators authorities\' radars. With nothing fraudulent happening and a straightforward account, it is highly anxiety-inducing to know that this company can just lock you out of your funds held in their account. I am simply perplexed in horror and amazement at the same time that they get away with operating like this.\n\nFrom today, I will be withdrawing all existing user accounts I had with Paypal, and instead of recommending Paypal to anybody in the future, I will be pro-actively dissuading them from it!\n\nFrom the state of the reviews shown here, I can\'t see these guys staying in business for much longer.
