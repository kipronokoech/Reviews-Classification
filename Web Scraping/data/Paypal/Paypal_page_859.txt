I'm not sure if I'm allowed to use names so I'm just going to say she was very sympathetic to my situation and wholeheartedly agreed with me that I deserved a complete refund.\n\nShe promised me she would personally see to it that I am refunded. I would like to give more stars however, it was only due to my persistence and obsessive research that I was able to reach a person of authority within the PayPal organization who possess both empathy, and Common Sense.\n\nWe both agreed improvements or the implementation of a merchant rating system and an escalation procedure would benefit PayPal and its customers.- end of update.\n\n\nOriginal post*\n\nI recently purchased a custom-made product online using PayPal.\n\nThrough no fault of mine or the merchant's the merchant was unable to make the item that I ordered and fulfill my order. So the merchant offered to refund me the $548 I paid.\n\nAfter the 10 business days passed and no refund was received, I got nervous and filed a claim with PayPal.\n\nPayPal's decision was to side with the merchant because he provided a tracking number for the initial Dental impression mold they send out to all new customers. It is my belief that the merchant was mistaken by providing this tracking number as proof of delivery of the custom-made item.\n\nI submitted proof to PayPal of the correspondence between myself and the merchant proving the item was never made, the item was never shipped to me, and I am completely entitled to the full refund.\n\nAll PayPal saw was the first response of the seller when he provided the mistaken tracking number. PayPal's decision is final and they refuse to look any further into the matter.\n\nI've spent days fighting with Pay Pal, 5 or 6 hours sitting on the phone trying to talk to a human being only to be constantly hung up on before reaching a human being. Every email they send me is the exact same form letter response that does nothing to answer any questions or reply with relevant information pertaining to the case.\n\nSo thanks to PayPal's ineptness and poor customer service practices a company that provided no product or service of any kind gets to keep $548 because PayPal says so.\n\nThis is my personal experience, however when searching online for other complaints against the merchant I am writing about, I discovered hundreds of similar complaints from consumers who also received nothing from the seller and received no refund. The merchant I am writing about is instasmile, and the complaints I read were from PayPal customers with similar experiences. That search led to hundreds of websites with poor reviews and complaints of this nature from PayPal customer. I'm sure the more I dig the more I find. Am I to believe that PayPal and instasmile are in cahoots to steal as much money as possible from their customers? At least that is my perception based on the complaints and reviews I've read on both companies.\n\n. How can anyone trust PayPal? Shame on you PayPal!\n\nYou need to study the customer service practices and m the technology used by successful companies such as Amazon, Microsoft, UPS, Home Depot, Walmart, and the like if you want your consumers and Merchant clients to trust you.\n\nYou need to assign case workers who are accountable for the customer satisfaction in each case. A case worker who is responsible for reviewing the evidence submitted, or who at the very least will read beyond the first sentence of an email before closing the case.\n\nYou need an escalation system that involves people in Authority who possess common sense and prudent judgment to make decisions on appeals.\n\nYou need to get rid of the form letter responses, because sending the same form letter response to every inquiry or complaint does nothing to instill confidence in your company. It serves only to make us consumers feel that PayPal thinks so little of us they can't spare 60 Seconds to craft a personal response that actually answers the question asked or addresses the complaint with relevant information.\n\nYou need more human beings interacting with the customers, your current automated phone and online customer services Center is useless in many common situations.\n\nMerchant's, how can you trust PayPal with so many fund hijacking complaints against them, and so many consumer complaints against them?", 'review_date': '2017-01-19', 'review_time': '23:03:16', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
