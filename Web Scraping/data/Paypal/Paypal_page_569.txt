PayPal confirmed that I was entitled to a refund. Sent goods back as requested by special delivery. I was also asked to submit tracking information details to the Resolution Centre. However, an error came up every time I attempted to use the link. I then tried to do it via my account but it stated that there were no cases outstanding. This could be because the transaction was as a guest.\nI informed PayPal fully about the issues. Unfortunately, instead of updating the case on my behalf, they told me to do what I had already tried several times, this repeatedly failed again. I was then told that because I hadn't done this that my claim was failed and I would not receive the money back.\nI am now without the ipad, without the Â£395 initially paid and I have also had to pay for the special delivery - a further Â£11.\nAbsolutely livid.
