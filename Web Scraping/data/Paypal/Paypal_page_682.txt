The customer service I've encountered have been nothing short of incompetent and rude. An interesting process I came across was when filing a dispute with a small shopify bountique - you know the type - I ordered the item to the wrong address so proceeded to try and cancel the item or at least change the address but didnt get any reply from any of their email addresses so I filed a dispute immediately. Despite ignoring my attempts at contact they replied to PayPal immediately with tracking details from China. 2 months later PayPal ruled in the merchant's favor quoting that they had provided a shipping tracker ignoring the fact that firstly it was the wrong address, secondly I've not received the item or been able to change my address and finally why take two months if you simply needed tracking from them to rule in their favor? Crazy.\n\nAfter trawling to find the best course of appeal I decided to just call them, the chap on the line immediately said this looked like an error and rectified the decision.

I called PayPal to confirm the reception, and they got it but needed time to process. I called second day and they told me they couldn\'t find the file. I then forwarded the email to their customer service. The customer service said the email from UPS was invalid and couldn\'t explain why. I asked if they\'ve ever received response from UPS. They said no, and I asked how then they can deem the prove was invalid/fake. They kept replying the file was invalid. I was wondering if the representative was listening although the rep. kept saying "I understand".
