They said the charges were authorized without backing this up with any reasoning. Their email would not allow me to reply, and their app would not let me create a second complaint to request that they reopen the dispute about the same purchase.\n\nThis is unethical to make it so difficult to contact them and have a back and fo the dialog. It's also unethical to close the case without providing any reasoning. When Ive called, the wait has been so long that it made more sense to resolve in writing.
