Yesterday, a foreign address charged me for some product that I absolutely did NOT buy, and charged my bank account that is linked to PayPal. I filed a dispute, stating very clearly that I did NOT authorize this purchase, and PayPal took the side of the foreign company!!!!! I went directly to my bank, showed them the transaction, and they immediately knew that this was fraud, and my banker told me that this "should have been obvious" to PayPal. Now I am wondering if someone at PayPal broke into my account to try to steal from me. I am currently discussing options with my attorney regarding this matter. I am VERY upset. DO NOT USE OR TRUST THEM!!!!!! PLEASE!!!!!!!! They WILL absolutely steal from you!!!!!!!!', 'review_date': '2022-01-11', 'review_time': '17:54:39', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

SIX DAYS ON THE REFUND IS STILL AT PENDING.\n\nThe seller assures me that the amount of the refund left their company bank account within seconds.\n\nSo where is my money ?.\n\nThe answer is it\'s being held in a foreign high interest Bank account somewhere along with the millions of £s of other refunds which would have been issued in the UK on the same day.The amount owing to me is in itself insignificant but combined with X amount of £millions of refunds held by Paypal from UK customers everyday earning vast amounts of interest it is far from being insignificant.And they won\'t be paying a penny of tax on any of it. The amount of refunds issued daily on a worldwide basis will be in the billions of £s.\n\nBut this is how they are making their money isn\'t it.Payments completed in seconds but refunds still pending after 6 days - how much interest does £10 million earn per day ?......who knows.\n\nThere is no real reason why refunds should not be passed onto a customer just as quickly as a payment is passed on to a seller.\n\nLuckily,although not ideal,Ebay now have managed payments.And purchases can be made now with debit or credit cards as the money goes to Ebay first.Most of my paypal usage is through Ebay but that is going to change.I will now only be using paypal where I know that I will be getting exactly what I ordered on the stated day such as my ICELAND food orders.\n\nIn my case - I am on a limited set income.The purchase I made was for smoke alarms to meet Scottish Government legislation coming into force in a few days.While Paypal are with holding my money I cannot buy from anywhere else and this is causing no end of problems.', 'review_date': '2022-01-11', 'review_time': '10:59:49', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

I used to think them of being fake comments from competitors, until last week as I encountered PayPal\'s "support" team.\n\nTo start with, I have been using PayPal at least since 2015-2016, and thus passed full verification for using Personal Account. So far I didn\'t have any major problems, until last week.\n\nFor business purposes, I needed PayPal for business account, and thus was checking if I should create a new one or upgrade the current one. I decided to upgrade my personal account as it had long history, was verified, and it was saying that Business Registration is not required to have business account (can act as sole proprietor). And I did so... Immediately my account got limitations on sending/receiving/and all the other possible types of actions - basically became completely useless. And they asked for verification, that included passport, proof of address and business license. Expecting that this will take some time, I asked the "support" if there\'s a way to cancel the requested upgrade, as I need to make payments ASAP using PayPal as there\'s no alternative for me. They said I should instead create a new personal account and I can use it right away without any problems, while they will try to verify business account asap and they DON\'T NEED business license/registration for business account. So I went on and created a new personal account, and guess what? - It got limited immediately, and again I got a request for verification (passport + proof of address).\n\nSo I uploaded all required documents for both verifications - both failed (but remember, that my first old account was ALREADY verified before). Then I provided new proof of address as requested and guess what? - On the new personal account - failed; on the old personal account that I am upgrading to business account - passed. Seriously?!\n\nGuess what happened next? :)\n\n1) Old personal account that I\'m upgrading to business account proof of address got passed, BUT, now out of sudden they require business license, which the website was saying IS NOT NEEDED, and "support" said IS NOT NEEDED, now is suddenly the last step of verification.\n\n2) New personal account which "support" said I can use without any problem - I provided again a new proof of address, and now received their email stating:\n\n"For the safety and security of the PayPal network, we often review accounts for potential risks. After reviewing your account, we have decided to close it because of security issues.\n\nWe are making every effort to minimize any disruption to your business.\n\nIf your PayPal account balance is zero, and you have no unresolved buyer complaints or chargebacks, your account will remain limited."\n\nThat is literally insanity, as because of PayPal\'s misconduct they already caused our delayed payments, thus we will be charged extra fees due to PayPal, or will lose business completely.\n\nNow, seeing all the earlier comments here makes a lot of sense why people hate PayPal so much. We all truly hope this disgusting company to go bankrupt in the nearest future and wish for a good alternative to emerge soon.\n\nWARNING FOR OTHERS: DO NOT KEEP ON PAYPAL ACCOUNT OVER $10 EVER! YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN PAYPAL DECIDES TO MAKE TROUBLE FOR YOU AND YOU WILL LOSE ACCESS TO YOUR FUNDS.\n\nP.S. in case "support" of this idiotic company reads feedbacks here (which I doubt) my Reference ID: PP-010-373-003-075.', 'review_date': '2022-01-11', 'review_time': '05:19:58', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

Don´t go there!\n\nI have zero trust in that company! Last year I opened an account and deposited 1.583 dollars. It figured on my account (and still does). I needed to transfer the money to a friend abroad. My transfer was blocked and PayPal directed me to upload documentation proving my identity. Fair enough. Only thing was that their software wasn´t functioning and upload continously failed. I got in contact with their chat service (which they had then, but not anymore!). Chat personel told me that they hadn´t recieved all needed documents. I explained that they seemingly had a software problem. Fortunately the guy wrote me that I could upload the documents through the chat-function. Which I did. But next time I logged in, I recieved a message that my account had been closed due to irregularities. And that within few days I´d be informed by message that I would by then be able to transfer the money back to my original bank account. Allright. Message or mail never arrived. Now, when logging into paypall, I still see my money on my account. But I can´t transfer them. Neither to others, nor to my own private account. And Paypal; well, they can´t be reached. They closed down their chat service. And whenever I call them I´m told that they closed that particular number. With no other numbers figuring anywhere. And I can´t write themfrom my account through their own message center. I can open a message, but somehow my possibilities to actually write and send a message to them has been blocked.
