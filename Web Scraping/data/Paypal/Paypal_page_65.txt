Just to think they have complete morons answering your call to only send you to another department that sends you back to that dreadful automated system that sends you through all these unnecessary channels just to speak to a rep. I have always paid my bills on time. This month I paid my bill before the due date thinking they would give me credit for this month and since it posted for April instead of May they charged me a late fee of $30. I was trying to get the fee waived and it's like pulling teeth they gave me the run around the first rep said she didn't see it because it was the dispute department and said she would send me to the right department then back to the automated line she sent me. Then I called back again hoping for a better rep that didn't happen. I explained to her the reason for my call and what the first rep didn't resolve for me, and she assured me that she would send me to the correct department after putting notes in the system and did the same thing.

Customer service was appalling - routinely sent stock answers and no one would get on the phone to explain what was happening or to allow me to contribute to their risk assessment process.\nThey told me they'd keep the funds for 180 days, but now we are past that and they refuse to repay the money.\nCustomer service keep sending the same stock answers that were clearly more geared to retail businesses and not remotely relevant to event businesses with cyclical events.\nThe whole experience has been dreadful. No one will take accountability, no one will get on the phone or provide anything other than scripted answers and no one will consider the evidence from my own business and rely on computer-generate assumptions which are wholly incorrect.\nI am utterly baffled by the market share they have.
