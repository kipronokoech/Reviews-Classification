This is the worst customer service I have ever dealt with. I purchase an item on eBay using PayPal. Never again. The merchandise arrived destroyed due to poor packing on the seller side. I immediately contacted PayPal and followedtheir directions completely. I waited and waited for a resolution to the dispute, all while receiving verbally abusive attacks from the seller. I reported all this to E-Bay as well who of course referred me back to PayPal. I tried several times to contact PayPal by phone and email to get an update on the case. I never received a response despite numerous attempts to reach PayPal. Tonight I received an email from PayPal denying my claim because they stated I had not given them the proper order number, which of course I had. They also had that information since it was on my purchase order that they processed. No one contacted me or returned my phone call anytime during this transaction. I tried to reach them countless times to no avail . At the very least they could’ve let me know if there was a problem with the order number. They immediately closed the case and I am out $110. It sickens me when I think of how much money I have spent through PayPal over the years. Run for your life before you use this company again. I know I will never use PayPal on a transaction in the future. Worst customer service I’ve ever seen.

I\'ll make a new account you are wasting time" and that "I\'m too late" to send this to PayPal, 2 days later PayPal has "confirmed" in their magical and super secret way that the transaction was unauthorized and gave him his money back but they kept the fees of the first payment and give him the fees that they took from my account!!! so he took his money, my ETH, and 2.3$ fees from my money!!!!!!!!!\nWhen I tried to contact PayPal after that and told them that it was a crypto transaction they said that it\'s not covered by the seller protection, and this is another problem, It\'s not what is covered or not, it\'s that that scammer has filed an unauthorized transaction, it\'s not my problem if it\'s covered by PayPal or not, HE STILL DID MAKE THAT TRANSACTION!!!!\nso later, I thought that I can later make the buyers reply to an e-mail from me to confirm what they are buying to maybe prove that it\'s really the buyer who made the transaction, so I wrote to ask PayPal about it, and they said that crypto transactions are not covered by PayPal Seller Protection whatsoever, regardless of proof provided, first I took it calmly like maybe he/she didn\'t understand what\'s exactly my point, so after I explained more the response was that however the reason the buyer has for filing the chargeback is irrelevant.

I directly give paypal all the evidences I have such as item details, date of transaction, tracking number..etc, but nothing worked!\nI had this problem multiple times in the last 3 years, one time I wanted to know why they closed the case to the wrong person\'s favor, so I called them and the guy of the customer service was sooooo MEAN and does not have any respect and he was obviously not professional at all, plus he refused to talk to me in English and also refused to Re direct me to someone who does speak English, because at that time I was new in Germany and couldn\'t discuss my problem in German language!\nSo I had to give up and I lost my money because of this thing.\nToday, in 29.06.2021 I faced the same problem with a fake seller who pretended to be the buyer and as always this fake seller didn\'t give paypal any evidences (I mean 0 evidences), I, however, made screen shots to every single detail and provided them with the tracking number and I wrote them a detailed message. After only 2 days I was shocked that they have decided to the fake person favor!!!\nThis time I tried to chat with the customer service, and told them why they\'re doing this, and one of them (her name was Sascha) told me exactly the following...\n___________\nAccording to the guidelines of PayPal, you are the seller and not the buyer, since the original transaction did not run through PayPal we can unfortunately not do anything about this point.\nTherefore, proof of shipping has also been requested from you, as the seller must provide such proof and not the buyer.\n_______________\nThat means 2 things, if you are a seller outside eBay and you made a transaction, then forget them if something happened, because they will in 99% of the cases will go to the buyer favor, however and whatever you try to prove them that you\'re right!\n\nSecondly and this is the most insane part, even if I was the seller (let\'s say), I still provided them with the right tracking number of the right item, but clearly they don\'t see anything and this is just wasting of time. Just one small employer will decide where and to whome your money should go, regardless if you\'re right or wrong person!\n\nThis is madness and insane and I will never advise anyone to use paypal outside ebay, especially if he was the seller..\n\nSorry for the too many details but I had to tell people what\'s happening so that no one does the same mistake "hopefully " as I did.\n\nWish you all a nice day', 'review_date': '2021-06-29', 'review_time': '11:10:05', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

I found out the hard way how Tickmill refuse to refund my deposit to my PayPal connected credit card instead the money ends up in Paypal wallet where it automatically get change to your base currency and I loose abut 7% of my deposit. WHY are Tickmill insisting on paying out deposits to PayPal wallet instead of doing the free of charge way for both trader and Tickmill itself of a REFUND?\nI spell it out for you it is called kickback. Paypal charge you as I costumer a huge hidden percentage in currency exchange, you have to look for a long time to find it and PayPal do not state how much it is. Most of the time if you deposit like 100 USD you would not notice it. PayPal makes its money buy this hidden fees that they do not call a fee or state on any receipt. Tickmill is getting a kickback from PayPal to force traders not be able to get a refund of there deposits to a PayPal connected credit card. So just by deposit money at Tickmill you will loose your money. Do Tickmill tell you that they will not refund your money NO. Not even if you ask customer service.They just like PayPal hide this fact from there costumer. And I suspect that Tickmill does the exact same thing with other pay wallets like Skrill and so on. It is a very clever way to scam you out of your money even if you are a profitable trader.\nPayPal do state that there costumer have the right to get a Refund if they ask for it.
