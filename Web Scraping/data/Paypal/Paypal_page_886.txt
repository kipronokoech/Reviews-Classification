I had no choice but to file a dispute with Paypal at that time. When Paypal got done with there investigations they responded by telling me that they would give me a partial credit of 38.00 for the items not shipped but that before that could take place I needed to ship back the items that Sammy Dress sent that were wrong at my expense and that they would either get the correct sizes shipped to me or refund me the remaining amount, sounds o.k. right?. Well I checked into shipping the wrong items back and because Sammy Dress is located in China it was going to cost 107.00, you do the math!!!! Well I called Paypal back and explained the shipping charges they wanted me to pay and how it should be on the merchant to pay for the shipping due to the fact that they shipped the wrong items and was told either I needed to pay the shipping, or keep the items and give them to goodwill and wait on the back order items to one day show up. Please understand that Paypal does not back their customers, they back the merchant! So I guess I'm going to do a good deed and give some clothing away, and pray everyday I may one day receive the other items I paid for. And I will never use Paypal again, or my Paypal credit account!!!
