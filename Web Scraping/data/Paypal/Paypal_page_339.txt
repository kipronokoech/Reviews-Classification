My case is similar to many here. I was in a hurry looking for replacement parts for my sons Chinese ATV I fell victim to a fraudulent website and realized it after the PayPal transaction. I contacted PayPal the same evening provided web address, fraudulent help email address, additional web based supporting evidence. They opened a case and a week later billed my CC based on a UPS tracking number from an Amazon purchase that was obtained by the thief because I provided my mailing address when making the ATV order. The UPS slip showed a ground delivery the NEXT DAY with no description other than selling partner Amazon which was for an order that I placed on Amazon a few days prior.\nMy order from the fraudulent site was for wheels and tires for an ATV placed at 8:00 pm. How could they possibly be delivered via UPS ground the next day??? This is a no-brained case of fraud. I appealed the decision and lost again. I filed a dispute claim with my CC company after reporting the same information but now having to wait 21 days for an order that I never received any confirmation for and of course never showed up. The CC case is now ongoing but PayPal is either complicit in this criminal activity or completely incompetent.

My friend contacted the seller and an arrangement was made to pay $100 for both tickets with payment made through PayPal. What my friend did not know is that she was being scammed. The scammer knew exactly how to protect himself and told my friend to be certain to use the “Family and Friends” option when making the payment. Not knowing any better, $100 in payment was exchanged and when my friend discovered it was a scam, PayPal refused to help her.\n\nDoing some simple Google research on my own, I found dozens of similar situations where buyers were lured into similar scam offerings where PayPal refused to intervene.\n\nWhile I understand the need for a “Friends and Family” PayPal payment option to benefit those who are not making business transactions, it has opened the door wide in being a huge protection option for scammers who know that PayPal won’t attempt to intervene.\n\nWhat angers me is that your company is well aware that scammers are luring purchasers into using this option and when scams occur, you won’t do what is right.\n\nHow difficult would it have been for you, upon the incident being reported, stopping the transfer of the funds to the scammer’s account?\n\nWhy have you opened up your payment platform to support these kinds of scams and leave those who are duped into using the “Family and Friends” completely without recourse?\n\nIt’s absolutely disgusting that PayPal, being well aware of these issues, continues to allow these scams to continue without offering protection to the buyer no matter what option is selected at the time of transaction.\n\nYou need to understand the emotional toll these scams put on individuals who had money stolen from them. This past week she’s been contacting her bank, the police, and protection services. All of this could have been avoided if PayPal had reached out to her and stopped the transaction. At this point, PayPal is telling customers that if they used the “Family and Friends” option that they should not file a dispute.\n\nFor my friend to lose $100 in a scam transaction that PayPal could have stopped upon request is just disgusting. I am absolutely appalled that knowing these scams are happening every single day without PayPal taking steps to curb them is deplorable.\n\nI hope you will reconsider how your company moves forward in an environment where your service is providing protection for scammers who prey upon unknowing individuals.', 'review_date': '2021-05-06', 'review_time': '10:34:05', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
