How is two step verification useful when you can't login. And what if you lose your phone and get another one with a different number? I suspect that this has not been thought through prior to implementation. If it had been, you would be able to contact them prior to logging in as they would understand that people change their numbers and do not have the chance to login to their account with their old phone number prior to it being changed. So my warning to you is that if you are changing your number before you do anything Paypal says you can't change it until you login into Paypal with your old number and update it with your new one- bloody ridiculous!!!", 'review_date': '2020-12-31', 'review_time': '17:39:01', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
