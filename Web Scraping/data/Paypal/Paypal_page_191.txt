I used PP at a merchant which turned out to be a scam. I contacted PP immediately since someone was clearly hijacking their logo and app to have money sent to themselves. I was immediately auto-denied, but then pleaded for help on chat. Another person looked into it and when this scammer provided fake proof of delivery,PP believed him. I had already provided PP with plenty of evidence that this was fraud -- I had received no emails saying an order had been placed or that merchandise was on the way or that my order was being delivered by a certain date. Indeed, the final receipt showed it was not a purchase but that somehow I had sent money to an unknown individual. But PP ignored all of that. With this second denial, it took a lot of saying "agent" and pressing 0 on the phone to get to a human who said they would actually contact the courier (USPS) to validate. Of course, no one had bothered to double check before the denial of my claim, even as it was clear an individual was scamming me. PP continues to enable the scammers by their lackadaisacal attitude. I will never use PP again. Hope it crashes and burns. Use your credit card backed by a good bank.
