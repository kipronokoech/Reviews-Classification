The most recent issue was a company accidentally/fraudulently withdrew €180 from my PayPal account which ended up as a transaction applied to my credit card. What was whack about this was this was a charity I had made a donation to years ago using a credit card payment. That card had long since expired. However, when this charity requested a payment years later on the same credit card (now expired), PayPal honoured the request but on a new different card, the one I now have attached to my account! They effectively honoured a fraudulent transaction on one card by applying it to another they had on file. Words fail me to describe how screwed up that is.
