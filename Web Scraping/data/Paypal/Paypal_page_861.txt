Extremely disappointed about PayPal and Apple customer service', 'message': "I tried in the last 1 week to buy and apple watch, as a Xmas gift for my boyfriend from the famous Apple website with their PayPal Credit which it is supposed to be ' Easy and instant '. I tried a many time, every time they replied Sorry PayPal Credit isn't available for this purchase, so I just wanted an answer why if they have the offer on their website, right?? so I went in Westfield Shepherds Bush apple shop centre to find out an answer but the people there couldn't give me a proper answer, the only thing they could do it was to suggest to call at the apple phone number from their website so i did that, neither the guy on the phone couldn't help at all, he neither wanted too, he just rushed me away. Then I tried apple Live chat a guy James, this time very kind guy, tried to help and he asked if i made any changes on my PayPal account, and i did, I confirmed again another card, as I thought maybe thats the reason isn't available for me, so James told me i need to wait 48 hours for the accounts to sync. Right, so i waited then tried again, still purchase not available.. I went back on live chat to ask them again, a lady told me better to call paypal. Great, I tried to call paypal but they have an almost non- existent customer service, call centre customer service it is open just from 8am - 4:30pm, or there is another phone number, where a robot answer your phone call and will keep you hours on the phone for nothing.. just repeating same nothing, sorry thatâ€™s the truth.. he will never transfer your call to an operate person, so itâ€™s just waste of money on an international call which keeps you forever. I called the second day 8am to speak with an operate person.. first one transferred my call to Paypal Credit department where i was waiting forever, no one picked up the phone.. i hanged up after 15 mins, so again waste of money on international call, and i called again, and finally another guy came with the answer.. after so many days and so much time and money wasted i found my answer why PayPal Credit isnt available for me.. My PayPal account was originally made in a different country than UK, the only think I needed it was to have an UK account and then I could apply and got my answer. So now my answer to them is: the people working for customer service in these two biggest companies in the world, they really don't care or they really don't know what they do!!!!
