Unfortunately; leaving a negative or ranking of no stars is not an option. I had been an Ebay and Paypal member for many years and sold genuine software on CD for ¬£15 per disk (we are Microsoft Partners). Ebay decided (without warning or explanation) to cancel our account. I therefore contacted our bank and cancelled Ebay and Paypal standing orders withdrew monies from our Paypal contacted Paypal - told them not to allow Ebay to access our Paypal account before going to Paypal preferences and turning off permission for Ebay to access the Paypal account. Since our Ebay account was closed, 3x "customers" made fraudulent claims against us. Because our Ebay account was closed, we could not log in etc to argue cases and Ebay could not be contacted by phone and failed to return calls. Ebay found in the favour of all 3x fraudsters and refunded from our Paypal account. The point is that Paypal allowed these refunds (on 3x different days) despite our contacting them by phone, email and their messaging service. They then started phoning and demanding payment of the ¬£45 and even took partial payment from our overseas account (without authorisation). Yesterday, I received a letter from Debt Collectors regarding this. In reply I have now created a website detailing the story. The case is also now being dealt with by the UK and Luxembourg Financial Ombudsman Services. In conclusion, Paypal support is self serving and incompetent. Paypal as a company can best be described as +++++ +++++++++.', 'review_date': '2021-04-16', 'review_time': '12:39:20', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

Turns out the 3 Q marks on my file are because I raised 3 disputes due to sellers not sending my items or I did not receive them. PayPal refuses to remove the Q marks on my credit file. So PayPal damages my credit file, when I'm the one who's been messed about by sellers and sellers get no penalties or marks on there credit file. Seems PayPal act very fairly to me. I lose money have to chase a seller to try and recover my funds the seller refuses I open a PayPal dispute I get a refund and damaging marks on my credit file. Still PayPal refuse to remove these marks as I explained to them Q marks are added when a customer and lender are in dispute not seller and buyer but PayPal seem to be incompetent to grasp what I'm saying and apparently any one who raises a dispute who has PayPal credit is in the wrong and you're credit file will get tarnished because you nearly got ripped off.
