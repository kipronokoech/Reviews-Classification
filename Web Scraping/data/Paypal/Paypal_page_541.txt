I ordered $206 worth of brand name paper towels and toilet paper from a company awkor.com, I decided to use paypal as I believed it would be a secure form of payment at the time vs. Providing my CC# directly to the company. After placing my order, I was alarmed to see the seller's details on paypal were from China w a hotmail email account this was not the info on the site. In a panic i reached out numerous times to the seller to cancel w no response. I involved Paypal and filed a complaint. They temporarily issued me a refund while they investigated. They were able to reach the seller who provided a tracking #. The refund was reversed and I now owed Paypal the amount of the product. I waited to receive my item before clearing the balance w Paypal. When the package arrived over a month and a half later it grossly did not match what was described by the site in quantity or quality. You could clearly see there were only 4 small rolls delivered. The tracking # on the label showed these details and matched the tracking # the seller had provided to both myself and Paypal. I took and provided photos of the unopened packages showing the tracking # description on shipping label and provided screenshots of my receipt proving I had been scammed and neither received the quality or quantity of what was orginally ordered. This was in May. I had trouble reaching a live agent due to covid19 so had to use the chat featur . What ensued was over 20 atrempts to get help with this issue I kept being told the issue had been resolved as I had received a refund I had to keep explaining that refund was reversed. Then I would be told I needed to submit a claim I explained the system would not allow me citing that the a claim had already been submitted and reviewed w a determination. Finally in June after demanding help from over 4 different Chat associates I received guidance from paypal on what to do. I was told the claim had to be reopened and changed from product not received to product not as described. I was asked to provide all of the details of the case along with photo evidence of my claim although I was extremely frustrated I compiled thinking this would finally resolve the balance Paypal is saying I owed for those goods. I was assured a swift resolution. July came no response I reach out to paypal for an update they say they are trying to reach the seller. Then mid July hits no response yet I reach out again Im told they received info from the seller and that response is being reviewed. I ask for a turn around time am told to check back in on 7/18 they will definitely have a determination by then. I check back in to my account and see the negative bal is still there the claim is still under review. I reached out this week as there was no word from paypal I'm told they understand my frustration and are processing my claim for review. This time I gave push back and asked exactly when this would be resolved given its been a grueling 4 months of back and forth w Paypal.I then receive a notice that in order for them to move forward w a determination I would need to file a government/police complaint and provide proof of this report.I was outraged I am the victim of fraud and have provided ample proof, this should be an issue Paypal takes up w the seller instead I'm being forced to fill and file more paperwork and wait more time for something that clearly shows the seller was running a scam.I used PayPal thinking this was a safe platform that protected the customer. I now realize Paypal and the sellers are crooks. Forcing their customers to jump through unbelievable hoops to resolve an issue . Any other company would have reviewed this case and immediately issued a refund. Instead Paypal is now sticking me w the bill for something I didnt receive. Forcing me to go through additional headaches w a 3rd party to get this resolve . This is Unacceptable customer service!!!!
