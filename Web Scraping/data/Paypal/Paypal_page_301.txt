The bras eventually turned up and, when they arrived, they looked nothing like their photographs. They were like 2 pieces of thin cloth - the thickness of tissue paper - and came without any documentation at all. In short, they looked NOTHING like they had been advertised and there was nothing present that indicated that we could return them (despite the advertisement stating satisfaction guaranteed etc.) We were not worried however because we had paid using PayPal and were aware of the fact that we could contact them and ask them to obtain a refund for us - because of this fact - and that is exactly what we did. After all, it states clearly on the front page pf PayPal's website that if a purchase does not match the Seller's description (and never was this more true than in this case) then they can reimburse you. PayPal however decided in their ultimate wisdom - despite the facts - that what we had received WAS in fact what we had ordered and therefore they denied the claim. My wife, who has not even opened these 'rags' that she had been sent, is incandescent with rage and has asked me to close my PayPal account immediately, which is what I am about to do. In many years with PayPal, this has been (I think) the first (and last) time that we have ever had to make a 'claim' of this sort and we now know that the so called 'protection' that is offered to buyers by them is not worth a jot and so we will certainly NOT be using this method of payment again.", 'review_date': '2021-07-27', 'review_time': '15:39:30', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
