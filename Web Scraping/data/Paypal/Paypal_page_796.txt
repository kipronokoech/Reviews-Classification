Paypal makes it easy to ensure your card and bank details are protected from online retailers. I've not had many problems with Paypal and in each case I've been able to resolve issues. Overall I would recommend them.\n\nThere are some things that need to improve though:\n- 2FA is sometimes broken - sometimes the text message will simply not come through for hours on end, so you have to revert to other details. It could be improved by adding support for fingerprint or Authenticator control, or an email, instead of personal details.\n- The mobile and app experience is so far worse compared to the desktop browser based version. This needs a lot of work. Lately they've been improving but it needs a lot more\n- Sometimes there are hidden fees for things, I wouldn't blame this on PayPal per se, but PayPal should make it clear what all the hidden fees are, before they take money.\n- PayPal credit is a waste of time and when Paypal joined with eBay it tried to auto-enroll me on it which was a bad move, I got out quickly\n- I'd like to see the return of temporary online cards so you can set limits.\n- Checking my bank statement and comparing it with my PayPal statement can sometimes be very confusing because of PayPal wallet, fees, and other reasons. It'd be nice if PayPal could include ID numbers to help link the two together. Or perhaps show the amount that was actually charged to me account for when something is charged in a different currency.\n- Sometimes deleting a bank card/account/bank is very confusing or doesn't work for no real reason\n- Not sure if PayPal actually adheres to GDPR because I don't see a link to download all my information.", 'review_date': '2018-08-11', 'review_time': '19:26:58', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

PayPal was the most secure option for sending money without fear of loss or issues. My funds have been "pending" for two weeks now.

After hours of research as to how to expedite receiving my money, I found that funds are typically held for up to 21 days to ensure that there are no issues with an item.

I literally spent 5 hours on hold, hoping to get this issue resolved. I went through email, both the app and the website looking for a chat option, and even through something called GetHuman (to attempt to talk to an actual person).
