Recently, we have observed several transactions that we deemed as fraudulent, and whilst they kept on coming, the clients started asking for refunds, and we have sent a signed letter to PayPal to advise them their platform was being used for such illicit activity, and asked for guidance as for what to do. We have immediately taken steps to stop further transactions to be completed, and guess what PayPal did? Yes, nothing. Long-story-short, a few weeks later, we had delivered some of the products of a few of these transactions, but because they were fraudulent, all were cancelled by their banks, or had their refund directly issued by us, and we ended up with a substantial amount of loss coming from those. Frustrated with the incompetence, lack of support, and how slack PayPal was in face of the situation, I asked for my account to be closed, and guess what? They are charging us dispute fees for each of the criminal transactions, plus the fee for the transaction itself, which wasn't refunded after they were either cancelled or refunded to the clients, and because the account has now a negative balance, they are refusing to close it until we pay them - yes you have read it right! They have directly supported a criminal activity, even after we have made them aware of it, have not provided any guidance or support to our company as for what to do in that situation, and now are charging us for that. And the support, once again, terrible. I've spoken to Maria Carmellita, Gabriel and Michelle, and none of them seemed to give a dang about it all, always trying to roll the situation over to the next support person to resolve. They are now threatening to send the negative balance to a collection house, and we will wait for the to come along to we can take legal action against PayPal and their criminal organisation they call a company. We were baffled by it all, and because we had balance in the account prior the situation, the only leftover fee to pay is of about USD60, which is ridiculous, and not even a fraction of the losses we incurred, but we are not paying it as a matter of principle, and we will stand by it against this awful company. PayPal, you should be ashamed of yourself, your support service, your employees, and your lack or care for your clients. Disgraceful service, and apparently they are quite keen on supporting criminals with stolen credit cards.\n\nAnd by the way, I have all the documentation, the record of the conversations with their support team, and the record of all the transactions made, and I'm happy to send them all to the Trustpilot team to support my review.", 'review_date': '2021-08-25', 'review_time': '20:46:04', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
