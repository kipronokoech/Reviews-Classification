So they gave me a link to upload my driver\'s license information and that they would review my case in 3-5 days. Before I even submit my identification (again, five minutes tops) I received an email stating that they had reviewed my case and decided to continue to ban me. When I called again they still said the reasoning was left blank. Now I must wait 6 months for access to a single payment from a customer, after which I will no longer be able to access PayPal.
