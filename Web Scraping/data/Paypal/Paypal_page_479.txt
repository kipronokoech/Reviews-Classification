I spent a long time trying to talk to a real person or at least chat with the real person. It\'s really hard to find where to navigate to get to a chat. The phone line asked you about 5,000 questions before they tell you that there\'s no one available to talk to you.\n\nI was very disturbed that I got an unsolicited debit card with someone else\'s name on it and it made me wonder if somebody got a card with my name on it. When I finally did chat with someone, I didn\'t get any apology or explanation. They just said "cut it up and don\'t worry about it". I kept trying to communicate with them about this and finally I said "Do not ever send me another unsolicited PayPal debit card ever. And they finally agreed to it". Then I asked them to send me a copy of the chat for my records. I was told that there would be a chance when I ended the message to choose that. There was no chance. So I started another message to ask them for a copy of the chat and they haven\'t yet replied. It\'s been a few hours.\n\nI will no longer link my bank account or my credit card to PayPal. I may not even use it anymore.\n\nA large profitable company like that with so many customers should offer better service and should not do something egregious like sending out unsolicited debit cards.', 'review_date': '2020-10-18', 'review_time': '23:49:01', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

It took me over 4 hours today to try and reset a password to get access to account I had not used in awhile. Usually the simplest thing to do these days. But like another reviewer some of my information had changed and I was caught in their ridiculous and poorly designed verification/access chicken/egg treadmill. The endless loops they put you through and clueless customer service agents made for perhaps the worst on line experience ever. If the merchant took another form of payment I would have given up after the first message to customer service. Forget the phone line. It is non existent and not staffed by actual humans. Just another loop of stupid questions and not very helpful answers to prevent actually speaking with anyone. If you ask for ‚Äúcustomer service‚Äù, you will transferred and then promptly disconnected. Finally after four hours and multiple agents, I was finally told that I should forget about accessing the old account and just open another account with a different email. Made no sense but problem solved. Why didn‚Äôt one of the other multiple agents I talked to for hours suggest that in the first place? If you must contact them good luck and you will need a lot of patience.
