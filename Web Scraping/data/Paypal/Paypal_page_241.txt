I stopped using PayPal for this reason. My most recent experience was when I tried to refund an amount someone paid to me, however due to currency exchange difference, they took the whole amount from my main bank account rather than the PayPal account which brought me into overdraft. There was no prior notification to give me the chance to add the few points of difference to my PayPal account. It was impossible to get someone to actually hear me or help me, every exchange was like talking to an algorithm or a robot. I feel sorry for people working there because it is clearly the way this is led from the top that is the problem. They genuinely do not seem to be able to help in their Customer Support team.', 'review_date': '2021-12-29', 'review_time': '11:14:36', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

As if the two orders were one or something. Anyway, I had all the receipts and emails and it was easy to document that they had obviously made a mistake.\n\nWalmart did not even respond (there's another TP review to give ...) and when I disputed the partial refund to PP, they of course took weeks to process it and even with the original receipt they denied my claim! To make it worse, they say that they have evidence that the correct refund was made but to see that evidence I have to post them a letter requesting it by snail mail!\n\nThe evidence is obviously something from Walmart where they were again mistaken about the amount.
