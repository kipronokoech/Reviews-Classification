I was told that in 4 days I would receive a shipping label from the seller. When 4 days arrive, Paypal sends me an email stating that they denied my claim. I call them up and argue with customer service. They relent and said that to return the product and then apply for a 30 dollar fee. If I return the product, I have no item and it cost me 30 loss.

What? It all depends how you interpret this word but allow me save you some time and tell you how PayPal interprets it.\n\nFirst, they give you a page where you can choose from several options. Laugh for yourself:\nGo to paypal dot com / smarthelp / contact-us, that\'s their "Contact us page". Hilarious\nWhy they put up this page to be accessed by the "Public"? Must be another of their cunning business policies. What\'s even more funny is reading their URL, ..."smathelp".

Did you allow a community to take your money or was it PayPal? I didn\'t know it was a community that sucks billions of revenue every year.\n\nIt\'s pathetic and instant proof of how little PayPal wants to deal with your problems with them. Just drag your issues with us over to some community forum and waste your time there.\n\nNow to the actual issue which I had with Paypal.\n\nDon\'t worry, I make that short.\n\nI disapprove ANY business partner to screw with me.
