After I called them multiple times, they decided to permanently limit my account (I cannot do any business with paypal nor talk with an operator-- the voice mail will keep repeating the same message). They hold more than 3,500 dollars of my Paypal balance, even though I have a confirmed sales and positive feedback on EBAY or Paypal (Paypal said they and Ebay are 2 separated companies, so even though Ebay confirmed my transaction, Paypal can still hold it for 180 days).\nI am seeking legal action at small claims county court (potentially federal court if my attorney advise me to). Paypal are well-known for their practice of holding funds --not just large amount of funds but also small amount of funds--(maybe because of interests generated from those funds).\nI understand that paypal is the only platform that offer both buyer and seller protection. But why are they still holding money once the buyers already confirmed the transactions-- and tracking numbers shown items were delivered? I understand the 21 days hold, BUT 180 days for confirmed sales are just stealing for interests.\nMy final advice for Paypal users is to WITHDRAW immediately once the money is available (never keep ANY MONEY on paypal balance, because they can suddenly decided to hold your money for tax reason, fraud reason, risk reason, dispute reasons, so on) In addition, avoid high value items sales using PAYPAL, try to use another middleman selling platform where you deal directly with them (not Ebay, although everyone knows that Paypal and Ebay belongs to the same company-But they kept refuse to acknowledge that so that they can shift the blame to each others, and you have to call them one by one).
