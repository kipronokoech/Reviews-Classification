My case was then taken over by Carla who I appreciated dealing with as she took in consideration my views and has refunded me for my item. Thank you Carla for your great customer service and for being helpful and thoughtful throughout this situation. I appreciate your excellent customer service provided and would be wrong of me not to review the service that you provided me with. Thank you very much! Carla did take in to account the problems that were encountered during this transaction, it has helped me with the security of using Paypal for future transactions as It has ensured buyer protection and thank you for Carla's assistance and service in ensuring and providing this assurance to me as a customer. Excellent service provided by Carla, once again thank you!\n\nI would chose 0 star if there was an option to. I ordered an item and brought through Paypal. Purchased an item which was from Paypal and felt that if I had any issues Paypal would protect me but absolutely NOT! I purchased an item and then realised it is from China and therefore cancelled the item and asked for a refund, however the seller decided to ignore my request and send the item but I sent a message soon after I purchased it, yet he posted it after few days and replied straight away stating that they have posted the item. Clearly ignored my refund request. I then received the item which is faulty so either way it is of no benefit to me at all, it wouldn't even be any point in considering to keep the item since it is faulty and does not work. I then researched about the company and it seems like the company is fraudulent and scams as they send out faulty items and do not do anything when you want to refund and if you refund they don't give money back.\n\nI then checked prices to send item back for a refund and the international cost of sending back the item is more than the actual item. I asked the seller to send me pre-paid postage since I was not willingly to send back an item at my own cost which is double the item cost when the item is faulty and also the fact that I asked for a refund way before he sent the item to me.\n\nI explained to Paypal the situation and they said to me I have 7 days to send the item back. I explained that during this COVID-19 it is risky for me to go out, I am pregnant, I have a 6 month old baby and a 2 year old child, to go out to send back a faulty item that I already asked for a refund on before it was posted is unreasonable, I require extra time until the lockdown to send back the item. Rachelle Bernice from Paypal was unwilling to help and demanded that I send back the item within 10 days or else there is nothing they can do. I do not find it considerate that I have to go out during COVID and risk catching a virus on myself, my pregnant baby and my 2 children however they did not care about my situation and gave me the option to either post within 10 days or they cannot do anything.\n\nAbsolutely terrified with Paypals service, I would have expected better service in such a pandemic however it clearly comes to show they do not really care about their customers or the safety of the customers except for the money they earn. They clearly are not doing anything to help so that they can benefit of the fees received from the seller. It comes to show what sort of company Paypal is after dealing with them in a crisis such as the COVID-19. This pandemic shows the true colors of a company and I have clearly got to see Paypal's true colours. Definitely do not recommend using Paypal. They are just not worth the hassle\n\nNOT FORGETTING TO MENTION HOW PAYPAL IGNORED ME AFTER I STARTED TO DISPUTE WITH THEM", 'review_date': '2020-04-24', 'review_time': '13:35:45', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
