After they got the company to respond, I was told I had to send it back to get a refund. But it couldn’t go back to where I ordered it… they gave me an address in China. Well that would cost about $450…. And of course I was told I’m responsible for the shipping accordingly to PayPal. I called them back *third time now* to explain to them the new issue, including photos of damages again and the slip from ups with the quote. This has red flags and scam written all over it. They agreed that wasn’t right and they will handle it. About a week goes by…. Now I’m being told I have to take this plastic grill to an authorized dealer, assess the damages and have they write a certified letterhead explaining the part is unusable to get a refund.

Utter rubbish as my details are the same that were added to the PayPal account when I opened it in 2018 and so clearly something is afoot. I am going to exhaust their internal process for complaints and then take this matter to the ombudsman if not resolved. I would recommend people draw down their PayPal balances quickly as something is obviously very wrong here.\n\nUpdate after call with escalation. The supervisor of the team initially implied that the problem was due to my bank but then he slipped up and it transpired that PayPal have changed their policy, just as I had suspected and are now wanting details of bank accounts to be provided by customers so that they have access to more marketable data. Without this information they will not release the balance in my account. This is a disgrace. Why should PayPal need to have access to my bank details? I’ve immediately removed my cards.
