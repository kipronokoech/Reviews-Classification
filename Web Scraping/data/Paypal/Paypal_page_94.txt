After using a PayPal account with no issues, I get an email stating my account is going to be permanently limited for sale of goods which were against the PayPal guild lines. This was all a shock to me and came to me by suprise. So I did as any person would do, and contacted PayPal about this. They advised me first that I couldn’t appeal this decision, DESPITE THE EMAIL STATING I HAVE A RIGHT TO APPEAL! I then got off the phone with the terrible customer service lady who clearly didn’t want to help and called again hoping to get through to someone else. I managed to get through to a gentleman who was a bit better and actually looked at what was sent to me and realised I am allowed to appeal, so he went ahead and raised an appeal for me as PayPal had permanently banned me for something that I didn’t do. I explained to them that I have kept paypal in the loop at all times and I have always made it clear that they are always free to contact me should they need to speak with me but I never received any contact prior to the email to let me know what was going on. The appeal came back as a decision that they were sticking to the ban and not going to reverse this. I called up again to rest my case stating that I am more then willing to provide any information they require from me and more importantly, requesting WHY I got banned. They couldn’t give me a definitive answer which clearly states they don’t even know why I am getting banned! How can they ban me without any reasonable explanation?! They stating that it was due to sale/purchase of “counterfeit items”. This was due to a purchase I made and when I received the item from the seller, it was clearly a counterfeit product. So luckily I was backed by PayPal goods and services and kept PayPal in the loop of this. I was clearly the victim as I had been scammed but PayPal still put the blame on me rather then the seller who sold me counterfeit goods which is 100% illegal. This is not my fault if someone sells me counterfeit goods despite me assuming I was purchasing an authentic product. I am very frustrated and will be contacting PayPal again to try and get this resolved. PAYPAL ARE PUNISHING ME FOR BEING A VICTIM!!! How can PayPal ban me from being the victim?! I have always been more then willing to cooperate with them but I will be raising a complaint as PayPal is important for my day-to-day life and I shouldn’t be punished for being the victim of being scammed!!', 'review_date': '2023-03-05', 'review_time': '14:52:16', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

This happened 3x in a row, so we just took it off auto-pay and remind ourselves to do it manually every month. Such a pain. Another incident happened today, where money was taken out from another credit card instead of the defaulted credit card. I asked how this happened, if there was glitch. No apologies, was told that it goes to PayPal balance first then to the backup card. Well, it didn't go to the backup card, still wouldn't admit guilt or apologize, they just kept repeating that payments cannot be reversed. Why and how are these people still in business?
