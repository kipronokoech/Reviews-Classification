I received a tracking number from the seller and looked forward to my purchase being delivered. The purchase was delivered to another address. After doing some basic research, I learned that this company takes your money, steals a real tracking number from UPS or a legitimate company and you never hear from them again and you never get the product you ordered. This experience is well documented on many websites that the same experience happens to every customer. The tracking number that was stolen was from a pool company, sent a filter system to a legitimate customer, because UPS gave me the address and I visited that customer. I ordered furniture shelves that this company has nothing to do with. The pool company has started a fraud investigation and states that my transaction was fraud. UPS agrees it was fraud and has started a fraud investigation.\nPayPal literally says they do not care and that a tracking number was provided by the seller (the stolen tracking number from a different company and delivered to another address not mine). I'm out my money and no product and no resolution and PayPal says tough luck. I have contacted PayPal 4 times to give them a chance to rectify their wrong. I will NEVER USE PAYPAL ever again and would never trust them. They stand behind criminal behavior and tell customers who use them tough luck if they don't get a product that was purchased. If it turns out that UPS is being hacked and this looks like a big scam operation the FBI will get involved, but PayPal stands behind criminal behavior and aides and abet's criminals.", 'review_date': '2019-07-23', 'review_time': '23:00:32', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

First was a visit to my Vet, the transaction was run as a debit and was declined stating that my pin was incorrect. I paid with another card and called them and was given a blah blah blah excuse that it was a random security check and that my account had been cleared and I would have no more issues using it. 4 days later I paid my cable bill as usual and on the 4th of July got a call from the cable company that my payment had been declined. So I called Paypal again and asked what the H*ll was going on. I had made a couple of other very small transactions with the card between them and I was wondering if it was because both of the declined transactions were $160+. After the same blah blah blah about it being a random security check I went onto the Paypal website and emailed them, asking for a REAL reason and no more bs about security. I explained that even though I entered my pin the transaction was declined and my cable bill was something I had paid with this card for as long as I can remember.\nThis is a portion of their response:\n"Our security system now takes into account your proactive transfer history when approving or denying your transaction request. One or two proactive transfers per month in an amount roughly equal to your average purchase would establish a history that would make our system more likely to approve transactions requiring backup funding. Since we are offering 1% cash back, which is uncommon for a debit card, we do not consider this an unreasonable request.. Just a few transfers a month may be all you need to ensure uninterrupted use of the card."\nSo since I have several other cards that offer much better perks than the 1%, I have been gradually moving to other cards and this is the end for me. I will NEVER use the debit card again and will attempt to NEVER deal with Paypal again unless absolutely necessary.
