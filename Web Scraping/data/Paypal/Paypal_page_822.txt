It said to write to NAME CENSORED BY THIS SITE, IT'S ONE OF 2 PUBLIC EMAIL ADDRESSES PAYPAL HAS EVEN IN A GOOGLE SEARCH which is an invalid email address, Gmail says. So I phone PayPal at its amazing negative-IQ robot, waiting for more than half an hour to speak to 1 of 5 of its staff, each of whom has a different grasp of different parts of the miasma. Each of whom fails to say another department handles that, and only the last of whom gets any sort of report from former responders. (That's what happens if you have a debit card, and it's considered a dispute, but God forbid they save you the in-between people to talk to.\nIt's about a charge that was not authorized; that the company's own emails admitted was not delivered, AND admitted I would have to re-order in order for them to charge me. And then went ahead and charged anyway. - AND that the higher level of the company already refunded on the 26th. This is the 13th of the next month.\nEmail-wise, I engaged with an amazing Sasha who kept saying she was 'confused.' She got that right. She sent one after another redundant forms, stating that they were additional information. This despite my finally pointing all this out. More wasted hours. She never did get unconfused. At some point, she no longer put her name on the emails, though. Or maybe someone else equally 'confused' took over the show.\nInstead, I called the umbrella company (the higher level the marketeer I was dealing with worked through) and got a refund from them. The refund is for the Paypal debit card. Which had a PROVISIONAL credit for that on it.\nSo I tell them the refund was granted back then, and ASK them if they even saw it. Did they look? - if they did, they did not SEE. (And of course they did not answer that question.) Because they undid the provisional credit, and took $250, overdrawing my account by $14, and had the nerve to demand I immediately put money there for them.\nThat was when I tried to answer this garbage company's emails, and the addresses were unreachable. Really. These are the addresses they show for themselves on a Google search. That was when I called for the marathon 4 hours to straighten it out, to the tune of a Saturday Night Live-worthy skit.\nIt ends up with Number Five saying 'watch for an email from us in 24 hours,' even though I said 'an email I cannot answer back.\nNo one explained the emails being unreachable.\nAnd I have PayPal processing money from my web site for several products.\nThis isn't the end of the black comedy, I guarantee. I will get another ignorant befuddled email from them that I am unable to respond to the address of, and then will call the same comedy team.\nThis has got to be fixed.

The buyer was brilliant, paid straight away, great I thought start looking for the much needed car. I then find out that the money was on hold????? what? I checked the fine print, can be held upto 21 days or if tracking provided 3 days after buyer receives it .......so tracking was provided by UPS, they confirmed delivery a couple of days later, rang PayPal, oh yes ok we will release the money to your account 8am on day 3 of receipt of courier. Ok, not happy that I have had to wait 7 days till I get my money, after all, my seller has paid I\'ve given him my laptop, but I don\'t have the money?. So 11 am of the day in question money still on hold, rang paypal \'oh it will automatically be release by 6.15 pm tonight\', What so another day!!!! no sorry not accepting that very stressed now as I found the car and needed to pay for it, was a really good deal and was desperate by now. I rang them kicked up a bit of fuss as to why they still had my money for now, 7days??????? Finally they released the money to draw on, I thought great can move on now, nope.....not so.......email popped up funds will now take upto 72hrs to hit your account we are now on Sunday!!! 6 days after buyer received his laptop, 10 days after I sold it!!. So I realise that the irony is not lost here, if I didn\'t need the money I probably would have laughed, a little disgustedly, but laughed, however I was skint and buyer needed to know if i was coming for the car, maybe people who are not as strapped as me wouldn\'t see a problem but I was livid, mostly because it was my bl**dy money!!!. After speaking to pay pal again! I found out that as there are dodgy so and so\'s on Ebay so they keep hold of the money for any disputes, now I said to him I wasn\'t a newbie, been 12 years on there with full positive feedback, over 300 items sold and bought and a no returns policy so why am I being penalised for them, and having to wait nearly 2 weeks for my money???? \'Sorry mam if there was anything I can do I would but thats our procedure" Great! brilliant procedure, so happy...not!
