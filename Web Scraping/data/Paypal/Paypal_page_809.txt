I receive a message from the winning bidder saying that they’d paid and will collect the phone in person. I checked my account and the money was there. The next day I received another message via eBay saying that the winning bidder is no longer passing through Cheshire and can I post the phone to her office in Ayrshire Scotland. Me being a decent eBayer I posted the phone recorded delivery the next day to the address started on the ebay email. A couple of months later I receive a message from PayPal saying that the winning bidder did not buy the phone and in fact her account had been infiltrated and that her bank was using a clawback method to get the money back. I thought this isn’t right I’ve done nothing wrong.....sold a phone and posted it in good faith and at the end of the day it’s not my account that’s been hacked, but no because I didn’t post it to the address on her PayPal account then I’ve broken the terms of the security from PayPal. I now have no phone £400 in debt to PayPal and they have instructed a debt collection agency. I’ve asked PayPal why this clause of the contract is not highlighted more, like when you are signing in or why ebay don’t stipulate it, rather than just in a few lines of the small print on their terms??? Anyway I’ve paid the bill in full today so as soon as it clears my mission in life after closing my account is to try and tell the world that it’s not as secure as people think. My advise would be to get the persons bank account and sort code and send it direct rather than using a middle man who make millions of us which is PayPal (or in my case it a pal)\n\nIf you think I’m exaggerating or being bitter please read the forums on these issues there are loads of them but I’ve highlighted one below.

When I continued to explain both the merchant and the PayPal system showed the refund complete yet it never posted to my bank account I was put on hold for over an hour waiting for a supervisor who never came on. The so called dispute/claim I submitted has never been addressed by PayPal so apparently they have decided it’s good business to keep their customers money. Great new line item for revenue, theft.\n\n2. I ordered something from Overstock, PayPal processed my money, withdrew funds from my account and never sent the money to Overstock. Again, no luck with getting the money back from PayPal. They make it impossible to get through to anyone, only resolution they offer is to work it out with the merchant and when they are the ones at fault you’re placed on hold for hours and your submitted claims are apparently filed somewhere that leads to no resolve.', 'review_date': '2018-05-22', 'review_time': '12:41:04', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

Well, most of them, actually.\n\nI\'ve been using PayPal since 2002 for making payments online (either through Ebay or with normal retailers) and it is my preferred payment method. I have spent many thousands through PayPal and have NEVER had a problem. I have also used it as a seller, and also no serious problems. Over the last three years I have been using PayPal Here to take payments from clients - around £50,000 to date - and neither I nor my clients have had any problems whatsoever.\n\nThrough Ebay/PayPal, I have had one complaint as a buyer (money refunded), and one as a seller where a shipment was lost in the international post (seller refunded by Ebay since it was not my fault, my feedback not affected).\n\nNot a single problem with direct PayPal transactions.\n\nI have had cause to contact PayPal on a handful of occasions. Transactions can easily be dealt with through the Resolution Centre, and there is only a problem with that if you insist on anything other than time reversal. Yes, it takes time to process, but it happens. You are not going to get refunded yesterday whether you like it or not, and the terms you sign up to do make it clear that the process has to run its course to make it fair on all sides.\n\nContacting them via the phone is simple. You click "Call Us" from the PayPal dashboard, you get a one-off passcode to use, and you dial the number. On the occasions I\'ve had to do it, the longest wait I\'ve had is about 20 minutes (but usually instant pick up). They bend over backwards to help - though if they get a stream of abuse or nonsensical complaining I suspect the outcome might not be what the complainant is after.\n\nIf you know what you\'re doing, PayPal is excellent.\n\nMy business depends on it. Personally, I rely on it whenever I can. I am therefore a heavy user. It has not let me down once in 16 years.\n\nAs for the overall score of 1.0 stars, people with complaints tend to post more reviews than those who are satisfied. It\'s unfortunate, but that\'s the way it works.\n\nAny company which handles money is always going to be open to idiots trying to defraud it or its clients. Any competitor taking on PayPal would experience the same - and would no doubt end up with people with unrealistic expectations giving it one star and saying it is rubbish.\n\nIt isn\'t. It works.
