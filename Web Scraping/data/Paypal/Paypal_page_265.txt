Your user journey to change a bank account is broken, as was your investigation and response.\n\nHow did I manage to get the bank account updated, I had to convince the phone operator to actually fix it; guess what?

Get this first we decided to add a business account to our established personal account. They do not tell you that the account is locked while they verify you. We have used this account for 9 years, they have taken thousands from us, but now they need to verify.\nSo anyways we went to purchase something through paypal for $5.00 and we get refused for the transaction. We know we have the money in the account it’s only $5.00. Anyways we talk to paypal last week about this and they said they need more information from us to verify an account; that has been open for 9 years already.\nWe decided to close the account they said they could not close the account because they were waiting for more information from us. We have given them enough info their issue was that the one document we sent them had two addresses. One was the land address that most people give the second was our box number which every town uses. We cannot control a company if they issue statements that show both our addresses.\nSo, we figured that is enough we will not keep jumping through hoops. A little common sense could have figured that out. I came into Trustpilot while I was waiting on hold with paypal to see how terrible paypal is in many other peoples’ eyes. Wow 86% one star that tells me that I am making the right decision to get away from paypal.\nSo they say they won’t close the account until they get the right info but if the businesses only give out statements with both addresses there is nothing we can do. We decided to never use the account and if it gets hacked we will contact our lawyer and SUE! 5 times we asked for it to be closed.\n\nWe decided to open a new account, we purchase three items without an issue then the forth item we needed to verify it is us? Are you kidding me once again, why? Because this should have been done first before you take any money out of an account not after the 3rd time. Then I go and check a little deeper into the account and I see fiverr has been added as automatic payment. Now you tell me how this would have ever happened when paypal denied the payment in the first place until I entered into a popup window my banking information, which I never did. I also had to disable my vpn giving me virtually no security at all except for https which if you know much about security is virtually zero.\nNow get this for the husband to talk on my behalf I had to verify and give permission for the husband to talk. Guess what the big security was on verifying the wife. What is your full name, you can find this info in almost any house from a bill that may be lying around. What I am saying is after all of this verifying (with banking info, location info …) then to only have what is your full name was NOT secure in the least.
