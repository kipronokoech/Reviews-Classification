They would rather transfer you all around the world and say things like "they will be able to get this lifted for you" LIE! They just say that so that you get off the phone with a good feeling from them (not to mention, how illiterate most of the employees are, constantly changing their words around) None of them have any authorization to lift your limited account, even if you talk their ear off with all the information I\'ve given them and all the proof they\'ve requested. The other catch is you can\'t even phone the only department that can lift it. So, my husband and I can\'t pay our attorney with our own money we added from our bank. Scumbag company, they are awful, terrible, the worst of the worst. We are closing our account immediately after this experience. Don\'t bother, find another means please.

Luckily I had a new card as I have moved countries and changed bank.\n\nAfter this the issue with the withdrawal was that I only had my Danish bank on, and I needed to add my new Spanish account instead, the format requested REG and ACCOUNT number, which I was unsure about as the Spanish bank account is an IBAN, but I managed to find it.\n\nAfter adding that, and attempting once again to withdraw the money, PayPal wanted to send me a message as confirmation, but to my OLD Danish mobile number. So I had to try to edit my phone number. PayPal would not accept my new Spanish phone number, they stated it was WRONG format.\n\nAt this point I was stuck, I contacted customer service who responded with a generic reply, making me send my message again, which I of course had not copied before and had to write all over again.\n\nThen they replied, saying that I needed to create a new SPANISH PayPal account, transfer the money from my Danish to the Spanish and then withdraw. When trying to create a Spanish account, I received the message that I could not create an account with my e-mail adress as it is linked to another PayPal account.\n\nSo, all over again, back to the messages, tell customer service that I cannot do this. They then tell me that I need to call in. So I call, spending more time on this issue. The man on the phone tells me my only option is to create a new e-mail address and that I will also need to send a bunch of papers to PayPal to transfer the money from one account to the other.\n\nI refuse to make an e-mail address only for one PayPal account. There must be another solution to this issue.

The short story is... I ordered a bridesmaid dress for a wedding... after receiving the dress and it wasn\'t as described by the seller I tried to work with the seller to return and receive a refund. This was not custom made, yet the seller wouldn\'t respond and the phone number was fake. Turns out there are a million reviews on their website about how the company is a scam. The company\'s name is JJs House. So I called my credit card company and they told me to work with Pay Pal. Pay Pal made me very optimistic, they explained that they were contacting the seller through email since they are located in CHINA! They asked that I return the item, which cost $33... after a month has gone by, I finally got a response stating that the case was closed, and that no matter what I will not be receiving a refund because the seller never received the item. They told me the tracking number was invalid, because it wasn\'t delivered... However, I can track the item and I even gave them the receipt from USPS. They refuse to help me, and stated that an appeal wouldn\'t be worth it because once they make a decision it can\'t be reversed. I asked to speak with a representative in the department that dispute was settled in, and they refused to let me speak to anyone. Stated that the they are in a "back office" and that they can only be contacted by email. I will never trust Pay Pal again... Now I have to figure out how to get a bridesmaids dress for my bestfriend\'s wedding before its too late, and I\'m out $170. Good luck to future buyers in filing a dispute through Pay Pal!
