Today I nearly lost the will to live speaking with an idiot in customer service. This is only 1 in a litany of issues I've had with them. Today I received an email saying a payment was rejected by my bank. The back up card worked. However, they informed me they removed the bank account and could no longer use it.\nI contacted support to find out why? He would not explain why they removed it and would not reinstate it citing data protection issues first and then security issues. BS!!! My account & my details. Asked to speak to a supervisor and he wouldn't put me through. Got the ususal no one is available. The reason the payment was refused lies within the fact that PayPal submitted a new direct debit mandate to my account without informing me or getting my permission. This meant there were now 2 active mandates for PayPal on my account. I immediately contacted support when this happened and they could not tell me why this was. I informed them that I was not happy with this and as they could not explain why the 2nd mandate I said I would cancel it and was told this was ok.\n\nThis combined with issues over people trying to scam me and PayPal not interested in the slightest in helping me, random freezes of my account without notification or reasons provided. I am done. The sooner they are taken down a peg or 2, the better!!! I'm off to revolut.", 'review_date': '2021-11-24', 'review_time': '09:20:43', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

These fraudulent companies create completely fabricated shipping and tracking numbers so when PayPal asks if you have ever gotten an item, and you of course say no, then they use that fraudulent tracking number as “proof” that the company is legit and that you received your item. In my case the tracking info I received from the PayPal system came two weeks after I placed the order and it stated that item was delivered two days before I received the tracking number. It also shows that it was delivered to “the office”. Mine is a residential address, not an office.\nIt seems PayPal has created a way to not only assist fraudulent companies into scamming people, but that they are making money off of it.\nThe only way to get your money back from scams, it seems, is NOT trust PayPal as they say you should, but to go through a credit card company.\nDon’t use PayPal!
