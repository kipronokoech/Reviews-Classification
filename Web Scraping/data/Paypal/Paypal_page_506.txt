I repeated the same detailed information over 25 times and got 25 irrelevant replies from 25 different agents none of whom has read the full conversation, whatever they had read they clearly did not understand and so didn't have a clue of what they were talking about. I was told dseven (7) times (last time yesterday) that the supervisor will call me the next day at the specific time - NO ONE HAS EVER CALLED. I have sent written complaints to executive escalations, marketing, customer support (which is now closed) - dead silence. The management is absent and no one is taking the responsibility for the proper functioning of Paypal. It was left to untrained hence incompetent staff in Manilla to reply to chat posts in any way they like without any quality control. When in desperation I called the only number still active for AU Debt Collection (based in the US) and explained my ordeal, I was told that there is no more technical support for business customers (closed) and so if I can't fix this bug myself - too bad, there is literally NO ONE within Paypal to help me!!!!!
