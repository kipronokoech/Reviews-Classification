There was no awareness of how the app worked and visible screens shown to users. After the first hour, wanted to transfer me to help sort out thier app problems. Not my job. Spent all of this morning with seller on conference calls, speaking with agent, then supervisor who wanted us to repeat steps already done mulitple times by both buyer and seller. Bottom line, money not accessible to seller or to buyer. Could have sent a money order or cashiers check, would\'ve been faster and WAY less hassle. At close to two weeks, paypal refuses to pay seller or refund money to buyer. If I could hold up countless amounts of other poeple\'s money for extended periods of time, the interest gained would justify this run around, if I were a dishonest person and hired poor English speakers keep poeple dancing on hold and doing repetitive tasks that solve nothing.
