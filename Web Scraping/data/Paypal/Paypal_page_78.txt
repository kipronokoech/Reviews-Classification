My experience is no different. Changed my email address on my account as no longer using previous one and no longer have acess to it . Now when trying to sign in I can’t get logged in on either one. What a joke . The app is useless as well, constantly failing , information fails to load , Paypal must be getting some financial rewards out of running a business so why are they not addressing these issues . It’s not just one or two occasions things go wrong it’s a constant issue. If I ever do get logged back in which I doubt will be any time soon , I will be closing the account . Much easier ways of managing money out there without the hassle of a service that is constantly not fit for purpose. These cowboys contacted me through their so called verification app to request the old email , after confirming the old email, even though it’s no longer in use , they said yes there was another account with the old email I gave them , then they asked through their so called secure chat service could they give me a quick call on the number I provided. I agreed . I then got another message through their so called secure messaging service they had attempted to call but got no answer . I once again sent verified the number , they never called . I called them to get both accounts closed , I was informed they would never ring me or ask if they could and yet there it is on the so called safe verified customer service app message centre . So what’s going on there then? They say it’s a secure system as you are sent a code to verify before having acess to the account . NEW CUSTOMERS BEWARE . They are employing people who misuse your account details then according to that . The woman was blatant they would not conduct business this way so there’s something dodgy somewhere. And after speaking to them on the phone call I made and being informed they would send an email stating what documents I need to produce to close my account guess what ? Still no email .
