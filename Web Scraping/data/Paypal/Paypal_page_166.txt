They will not even allow me to open a dispute and protect myself with the buyers account that is clearly associated with their website. I have proof and documentation of everything and they could really care less! PayPal should really have a better system to protect all parties from fraud because this is ridiculous! Also to make matters worse, the PayPal agents inform me that they have received multiple calls in the past few months of sellers with similar issues and they have not placed protections to inform users of PayPal of this issue! If they knew their likeliness was being duplicated and causing issues why not inform both sellers and buyers of this issue as funds are requested and sent!
