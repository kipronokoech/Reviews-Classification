I currently live in Thailand and it\'s incredibly simple to transfer money to ANYONE transaction fee free with standard banking apps (to any amount at that).\n\nONLY in the good ol\' USA is transferring cash a nightmare. Case in point, my recent experience with PayPal. I had a friend in the states use PayPal to send me a nominal amount of cash (keep in mind I still bank with large US banks, i.e. Chase)--so I setup my Chase checking account and credit card with my 10+ year old PayPal account and tried to accept the money. No go.\n\nContact PayPal support, I get bounced around to 4-5 different agents because they apparently are all incompetent. Eventually we get to one that says something more than just "We cannot complete your transaction." The answer is, PayPal has the money, it\'s been debited from my friend, but we can\'t GIVE it to you, because your account has been flagged for a security concern.\n\nReally? What kind of crap is this? I have verified my bank account, credentials, activity, identity, whatever, multiple times and you refuse to let me access to my own money.\n\nPayPal you are worthless, have horrible customer service, and we can only hope that you are a victim of the recession and economic downturn. I really want to make this point! I called the contact number and it actually identified my phone number and it tells me "We cannot help you with your issue" and hangs up on me! The website/app gave similar responses when I tried to file a complaint, basically it locks you out. Go forth and see the other reviews on this company, it must be run by 3 kids stacked in a trench coat.\n\nUSA--wake up and make transferring money digitally easier.
