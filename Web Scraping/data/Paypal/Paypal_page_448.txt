They do not fight for their customer rights and their customer service is lazy and dismissive. I have been with them for over 25 years. In that time I have asked for 2 refunds. Once 15 years ago for a cell phone I found out had been stolen and last year. I had no problem whatsoever getting the first refund. They gave me the money back right away. Now though when you file a dispute they require that you ask for a refund first from the merchant and of course I was denied which is why I filed a dispute with PayPal. During the dispute process if the merchant denies the refund again then you have to file a dispute to get PayPal to do anything. They give their customer HALF the time to reply as they give the merchant. Why should we have to do anything more past requesting a dipute? Does PayPal think that I was fine with the merchant denying my refund a second time? Their dispute process is garbage. They gave me 2 weeks to respond but I couldn't respond during that time frame. I was working in hospice staying 24 hours a day with a man that had a terminal condition. This didn't matter to PayPal CS at all. They would not reopen my case or help me get this refund. After 25 years I am sure they've made thousands of dollars from my account. I was planning on becoming a merchant. Too bad for them they won't be getting a penny more from me. I recommend that you don't use their service. Look on the forum at all the complaints.
