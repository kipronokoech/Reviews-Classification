I wanted to purchase some items online and the seller promised to ship the goods to my address shown on the transactions details when I made the purchases on November 3 and November 7. However, the seller never once sent them, so I opened a dispute. PayPal denied all of my dispute claims for item not received because they believed that there was some fraudulent activity on my account, but there is none. I authorised all of the transactions and I even have ID and bank and card details and statements to prove it. However, PayPal is refusing to give me a chance to remove the limitation. They said that I need a bank statement showing my name, address and the transactions I made to the seller from my bank account. I feel like PayPal is taking the sellers side over mine. They said that they activated the Buyers Protection for me, but there is none for me because they said that my purchases were ineligible for purchase protection, but when I called customer service, they always told me that PayPal activated it for me. The seller didn't even provide any evidence when PayPal gave them 10 days to respond. When the seller made a partial refund offer, I declined because items were not received and PayPal still decided the cases in their favour. The seller basically scammed, cheated and defrauded me! PayPal is endorsing the scammers. PayPal didn't even give me any chance to remove the permanent limitation and let me submit evidence to prove that none of the items for all 6 of my transactions to Yes Logo Design were received. I lost my money and the items. PayPal let the seller scam me and just say and watched.... They just ignored me. Customer service is poor, in my opinion. PayPal doesn't even reply to my emails at all. They sometimes reply to texts on Twitter, but they never help because they're always repeating themselves by saying that we permanently limited your account and denied all your claims. They never gave me a proper reason as to why they denied my claims. They just denied them all. When I do call them, they take forever to pick up and they're not helpful. They always said they would call me back and email me, but they never do! I have a feeling the team at PayPal is ignoring me every time. This is so unfair to me as a buyer. PayPal won't even let me appeal either. They aren’t helping me at all. The Buyers Protection is not even activated for me disputes, which is super unfair. I want all 6 of my cases with the scammer seller reopened and the claims decided in my favour for all of them. I made 4 transactions for $65, 1 for $112.5 and 1 for $125. In total, that would be $497.5 refund that I want back. The money belongs to me and it's unfair to me as a buyer to get scammed. PayPal is being super hard and tough on me. I really hate what they're doing to me.\n\nMy Desired Resolution:\nI want all 6 of my cases with the scammer seller reopened and the claims decided in my favour for all of them.

PayPal is not being helpful here. I really hate what they're doing to me. I also want $152.5 NZD for the stress and unconvinced that PayPal caused me. They wasted all my time and energy. Worse of all, they don't even care. I even told them and had compelling evidence to show that the seller was blackmailing, threatening and trying to extort me, but they always ignored me! I have proof of text messages in the Messages Centre on the website in my login portal. PayPal is not even fighting for me...\n\nNot to mention, the problem is that I used an alias and used a different year in my DOB to sign up for PayPal because I’m still a minor. I need help. I was always told I had Buyers Protection, but I never did! PayPal lied to me all this time for more than 2 weeks! I was told that since my account has been permanently limited, I’m ineligible for Buyers Protection. Even if there was evidence to prove I did not receive any items, as long as my PayPal account is permanently limited, they will always find in favour of the seller. It doesn’t even matter to them how many times I try to appeal or reopen my cases because they make it difficult for customers with a limited account.
