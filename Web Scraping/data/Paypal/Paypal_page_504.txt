Pay-pal did intervene but sided with the seller saying that I had not fulfilled what they asked me to do, namely return the unordered items at my expense showing the return tracking documents and that only then would the seller reimburse the money that they had falsely obtained from me via false advertising. So Pay-pal you know nothing about customer service and side with the seller, after all it is them that pay you a fee and not the customers.', 'review_date': '2020-09-20', 'review_time': '18:39:41', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

When I wanted to leave a review about PayPal on line, I never guessed how bad their reviews were - and I am just piling on. Ordered something and used PayPal. The item never arrived, so I called the merchant (overstock.com) to cancel the order. They gave me the runaround, but waited an additional week. When no response from merchant, I disputed the charge with the underlying credit card company. They sent a message with the dispute saying goods not received, but PayPal in their great wisdom recorded it as a fraudulent transaction (which it was NOT). They then locked my account, and requested all kinds of information be sent to them to remove the "limitation" as they call it. Their website would not accept the information that I scanned into my pc, which then resulted in contact with customer service - by email as you cannot talk to them (their phone system leads you along and then says you can\'t solve this over the phone, do it on-line). I got emails daily saying the same thing over and over and over. I explained the error made by PayPal but no one ever addressed it - just kept saying provide us with all this personal information (surprised they didn\'t ask for my social security number and the birth dates of my children). I even went to my credit card company who I presume has someone who deals with PayPal but they didn\'t help either. I am done with PayPal but would like to close my account and remove my information - but they won\'t let me do that until I remove the limitations.
