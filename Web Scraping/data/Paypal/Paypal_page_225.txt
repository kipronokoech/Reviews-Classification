Let me explain first. Paypal let\'s sellers abuse and bypass their obligation to accept returned goods. Paypal requires the returned parcels to have a tracking update that either mentions a successful delivery or a delivery attempt, both of which are impossible in many occuring cases. For exampe: once a returned parcel reaches China, the tracking update states: "The parcel has reached the China Customs" - at the same time the recipient (the seller) gets an SMS message asking to declare the newly arrived parcel (this is a worldwide standart, I am sure you are aware of this). No further tracking update will be made for 30+ days - up until the point the parcel gets returned back to the sender. And this is what certain sellers are doing - they are waiting out the Customs storage period to bypass the Purchase Protection and avoid picking up the returned goods / refunding the buyer. I had multiple occassions like this, as well as multiple conversations with multiple Paypal support agents - each and every one of your agents did not provide any help, leaving me with no product and no money.', 'review_date': '2022-02-21', 'review_time': '17:04:22', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

I ONLY USED IT BECAUSE THE BUYER OF MY PHONE INSISTED ON USING IT. I WAS SELLING MY PHONE ON FB MARKETPLACE FOR $450NZ. THE BUYER MADE THE PAYMENT OF $450 AND I GOT A CONFIRMATION EMAIL FROM service @intl. paypal. com. THEN, THE NEXT EMAIL SAID, I WOULD NEED TO PAY $250NZ TO CONVERT MY ACCOUNT TO A BUSINESS TYPE AND WAS TOLD I CAN ALWAYS REFUND THE MONEY. I WAS INSTRUCTED TO SEND THE MONEY TO Njukijonh @ gmail. com WHICH WAS THEIR SUPPORT EMAIL. I WAS ALSO TOLD TO TAG THE PAYMENT "FOR FAMILY & FRIENDS" SO THEY COULD PROCESS THE TRANSACTION QUICKER. AFTER DOING THAT, I GOT AN EMAIL SAYING FOR PAYPAL TO RELEASE THE FUNDS TO ME, I WOULD HAVE TO PAY AN INSURANCE FEE OF $850. I WAS TOTALLY SHOCKED! I TOLD THE BUYER, WHO BY THE WAY WAS NAMED, OBAJIMI ADEFIRANYE, THAT I DON\'T HAVE THAT MONEY. HE THEN SAID THAT HE\'LL SHOULDER THE $300 AND I CAN SHOULDER THE $550. HE SAID NOT TO WORRY BECAUSE I CAN HAVE THE MONEY BACK, AND THE SAME WAS STATED ON THE EMAIL THAT I GOT FROM PAYPAL. AFTER THAT, PAYPAL WAS ASKING ME TO LINK MY OTHER DEBIT AND CREDIT CARDS. IT ASKED FOR THE CARD#, EXPIRY AND SECURITY CODE (CVC). I TRIED DOING IT SEVERAL TIMES BUT THE SYSTEM WAS NOT ACCEPTING MY OTHER CARDS, SO I TOLD THE BUYER THAT I WAS HAVING ISSUES. HE TOLD ME TO REPLY TO THE EMAIL THAT I\'VE RECEIVED. SO, I DID. IT WAS JUST NEVER ENDING. I THEN FELT SUSPICIOUS SO I RANG MY BANK. I WAS ADVISED TO BLOCK MY WESTPAC ACCOUNT BECAUSE I MAY HAVE BEEN SCAMMED. I THEN SEARCHED ONLINE HOW TO CONTACT PAYPAL. I WAS ABLE TO GET HOLD OF PAYPAL VIA THEIR MESSAGE CENTER. I TOLD THEM THE STORY. I WAS TOLD THAT THE EMAILS WEREN\'T FROM THEM AND NOT LEGIT. I WAS DEVASTATED. I DON\'T UNDERSTAND HOW IT HAPPENED WHEN ALL THE WHILE I WAS USING THE PAYPAL APP. I ASKED AND EVEN BEGGED THEM TO HELP ME GET MY MONEY BACK. I\'VE E EXPLAINED TO THEM THAT I WAS SCAMMED.
