I am reporting to Secretary of State and any other institution I can. These people SHOULD NOT be allowed to handle any kinds of banking transactions.

THE VENDOR CANCELLED WITHIN 3 minutes as they caught it right away also. Canned responses. No one available by phone. Answers were not in relation to my issue. I was on "chat" with them for a week- They would NOT process the order cancel- Even the merchant spent a full day on chat with them. They kept saying it was an echeck that I had to cancel with my bank. Which, that was not true, it was not an e-check and should make no difference. Order cancelled. On a Sunday. 3 minutes after ordered. Even with all my communications ( does this sound familiar, " I see you have left the chat.Another customer service person will be right with you." they let this go thru my bank where I of course incurred fees. I continued literally copying from their own website- TO CANCEL AN ORDER, CONTACT THE MERCHANT. THE MERCHANT CANCELLED WITHIN 3 MINUTES. They also contacted Paypal directly and they STILL WOULD NOT CANCEL THE ORDER. They then told me I had to put thru a stop payment. I finally did this because now, 5 days later, THEY PUT THRU MY BANK AGAIN. Unbelievable. Today I received notice that payment did not go thru. Well, no kidding. And, that my dispute was denied. (It was not a dispute, it was asking them to PROCESS THE ****** CANCELLATION OF THE ORDER . ) Denied because it did not go thru the bank. OMG. And the next one...because this transaction did not go thru, we have removed this bank from your account. yep. Seriously. Honestly, I am closing out what I have- some streaming auto pays and news subscriptions- but have not had a chance to do that yet. So, now, they screwed up my bank account trying to put this cancelled $100,000 order thru TWICE after a week of conversations...NOW, they are screwing up my auto pays because they removed my bank account because I did a stop payment on the transaction they refused to process the cancellation for.\n\nHere is a bit of the chat: Names removed VERY frustrated\n\nPayPal Virtual Agent8:39 AM\nHi!

Unfortunately, approximately a week later the scammer raised a dispute, stating that I had sent him an empty box.\n\nIn addition to this, I received a phishing email regarding the dispute. Unfortunately, I called the phone number in the phishing email and they managed to lock my PayPal account. Furthermore they informed me that I had to give them my 16 digit debit card number, so they could refund me the money. Fortunately, I did not give them my debit card number and I had to spend several hours on the phone to PayPal to reset all the security settings on my PayPal account. Fortunately, PayPal also closed the dispute in my favour. I therefore received payment for the video doorbell.\n\nAt least that was what I thought. In March 2020, I received another dispute from this scammer (3 months later). This time the scammer claimed the video doorbell was in the box, however he claimed it was damaged. Due to my past experience, I ignored these emails from PayPal because I thought the matter was closed and I presumed they were phishing emails.\n\nTo my dismay, PayPal found in favour of the scammer and withdrew £105.00 from my bank account. When I contacted PayPal, they were not interested, despite all the evidence I had presented to them. As far as they were concerned the dispute was closed. I was transferred from department to department and no one at PayPal wanted to deal with my complaint. The customer service was dreadful. I now find myself £265.00 out of pocket, since I have paid £165 for the video doorbell and £100 to the scammer.', 'review_date': '2020-05-06', 'review_time': '16:48:26', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
