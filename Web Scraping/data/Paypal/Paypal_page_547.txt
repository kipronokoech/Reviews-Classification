I usually am not one to go out of my way to write negative reviews, but I’ve had nothing but bad experiences with this company and I’m honestly puzzled as to how they’re still existing. Years ago I made an account and I used it to shop without any issues and only on limited websites. I then get messages of my account being hacked and numerous phishing emails. I didn’t want to deal with this anymore so I log into my account to close it. Back then there wasn’t an option to just close the account online, you had to call in. The waiting time for customer service was atrocious. The person that helped me reluctantly closed my account. Recently, I decided to give them another chance hoping that time would improve things, but it’s just as bad seemingly. There’s so many errors on the website and I cannot link my accounts with PayPal, despite them being from a major institution. I guess it’s a warning sign that they’re not worth getting caught up with. With all the other alternatives out there to send/receive money, do not bother with this company at all. Also nowadays shopping online is much safer and companies tend to have better policies for any mishaps, you really do not need these obsolete service at all.', 'review_date': '2020-07-25', 'review_time': '10:54:32', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
