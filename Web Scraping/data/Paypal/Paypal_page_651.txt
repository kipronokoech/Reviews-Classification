I had a 7 year old account shut down without any issues and notice and funds blocked for 180 days! All my funds blocked with so many orders unfilfilled. I was left with no cash to fulfill the orders and had to take a personal loan. Worse, they did not even communicate the reason to close the account. It took me 1 hour to reach their calling support each time I called them, only to be told that they cant share the reason to close the account for security reasons.\nThey block your fund for 180 days to earn interest on it, and have the worst customer support team ever, that is impossible to get hold of.', 'review_date': '2020-02-05', 'review_time': '12:40:56', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
