I have had trouble with them on occasion in the past but never felt the need to speak up until now as the other issues were problematic but resolved quite quickly.\nI purchased an item via ebay on Christmas eve and chose "pay after delivery" which is one of paypals options. It turns out that the seller, who apparently had around 19 of these items, had none at all. I opened a case through paypal to stop the payment going through, when the item had not arrived. As paypal had made the payment, it seemed to me an easy process for them to recall the payment from the seller. It appears I am mistaken however, as paypal are insisting that I make the payment, wait until after 19th January when they are satisfied the seller is going to send the item before I can reclaim the payment. The seller now has at least 5 cases against him for non receipt of items. He has not responded to any attempts at communication from any of the other complaints (they state this on the feedback left for the seller)\nPaypal are supposed to protect buyers, so why this drawn out process. It is clear what is happening and they still refuse to act promptly. It is costing me money via bank charges because they refuse to act in a timely manner. I am disappointed, upset and angry. Paypal need to review their processes here, but judging from the other reviews I have read on their performances and attitude, I doubt it will happen. Maybe the time has come to use another source for buying/selling items where the need for paypal isn\'t required.', 'review_date': '2019-01-15', 'review_time': '11:14:07', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
