My passeport, my national ID, my driving license literally every identity document I have and I'm still not verified. And I'm not able to take my money out. So you guys let me top up the account with no problem but when I need to take it out you guys prevent me from doing so. This is theft. You sent me an email saying I need to verify myself by taking a live selfie with my phone but you haven't provided info on how to do so.\nThis is the worst customer service ever. Give m my money back and cancel my card and refund me my money I'm tired of having to deal with you.

Wise is no different. We’re a regulated financial institution, and verification is how we keep your money safe, and comply with the financial regulations in the countries we operate in. We do our best to complete verification as soon as possible, and it’s typically done within 2 – 4 working days. In rare cases, it might take longer if we need additional information, but we’ll always let you know if that’s the case.\n\nOur customer support is happy to help you at https://wi.se/contactus_ or through our social media channels.\n\nWise', 'CompanyReplyDate': '2023-02-16', 'CompanyReplyTime': '14:33:40'}

We can't share the exact reason for the deactivation, due to how we're regulated.
