Only issue is having to constantly verify the bank account I'm sending from (when sending ACH transfers, which are by far the cheapest option for sending).\n\nWith certain banks you can only verify by SMS with a US phone number, which is impossible if you're overseas and sending money to yourself as these verification services don't send text messages to international or VOIP numbers.\n\nLuckily I use multiple banks and was able to verify a different account using my login and an email-based verification code.\n\nStill involves some hassle that can take a few minutes to complete, but overall the service is reliable and much cheaper than other alternatives.", 'review_date': '2021-12-15', 'review_time': '15:55:10', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

For example— how you'll pay, how fast would we receive your money, how long would the conversion take (which can be up to 1-2 working days in rare cases) or whether it falls over the weekend/holidays. Most banks won't operate over this time, which can cause some wait.\n\nTake a look at some possible reasons, why transfer can take a bit longer at:https://wi.se/whymytransferistakinglonger.\n\nIf you have any further questions, or would like us to take a better look, please reach out at:https://wi.se/contactus_.\n\nWe're always here to help.\n\nBest wishes,\nWise.", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2021-12-28', 'CompanyReplyTime': '18:45:55'}
