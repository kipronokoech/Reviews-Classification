I feel that I have been subjected to unwarranted pressure and discrimination, which seems to be based on factors like race, color, and origin. These circumstances have led to my forced submission of personal data, including photos and ID documentation.\n\nWise's actions have not only breached my privacy but also contravened fundamental principles of non-discrimination. Such behavior is entirely unacceptable and reprehensible, and I have decided not to tolerate it any further.\n\nI am taking immediate legal action against Wise to hold them accountable for these significant violations. I will work with the relevant authorities to ensure that justice is served.\n\nFurthermore, in light of this betrayal of trust, I am severing all ties with Wise.
