We're not there just yet, but we work hard to make it happen. We always charge as little as possible: right now a tiny fee, eventually free.\n\nWe already have no subscriptions, no monthly fees.

Dystopian system being set up..', 'message': 'When trying to get help, it is very difficult to find their phone number to speak to someone on the website. Once you find it and call there is always a long wait to speak to someone. After my call I would write the phone number down for future use but the next time I call the number no longer is a working number because they keep changing the number. I have to go spend an hour to find the number again on the website. Anyway, my issue this time is when I went to send money to my father in law (we send every 4 months) i want to mention we have had an account for several years now when I was prompted to submit my driver\'s license again and could not proceed with out doing this. They told me that my DL has expired (10 months ago BTW) and I need to submit it again. So why now without notice when I need to make a much needed transfer? My father in law is 99 yrs old and needs this money for his everyday living. Here is the problem, when I called to inquire why they need this again which I have done many times, I explained I recently lost my DL and am waiting for the replacement which can take 10 to 14 days. I have the paper the DMV gives you to use until you recv the replacement DL. Their system did not accept this and when I called they would not either. To bad that there is a 99 year old who needs to buy food and pay his bills and so what you already submitted your DL when you opened the account and several times after. DL\'s exp. every 4 yrs and YOU RENEW IT. I have never had to resubmit it with any of my financial accts ever. With my Credit cards or any acct where I had to use it for to open or have verification. There was no exceptions with wise, no work around nothing I could do. This is a problem and a ridiculous policy, a huge inconvenience and harmful to a person\'s health! My father in law\'s! So I had to find another transfer service which was time consuming setting new accts after acct. I was able to find a company to send part of the money because of limits set on new accts. After 2 weeks I finally recvd my DL and tried to submit it but now they wanted my selfie to continue ? Wth, no work around possible I was told on the phone. So this was never required in the past, are we turning into China now? I don\'t want to provide my bio for facial recognition, isn\'t my DL enough? Will they want my blood next? Where does it stop? They are setting up a dystopian system and you can see it in China, is that what people want? Not me! They told me it was to keep my acct secure BS, they didn\'t need it before it is a lie. They did not care about how all these "security measures" was causing unnecessary hardship and inconvenience to the acct holders! Clearly it is just over kill and causes more trouble then is necessary. I can hear it now from people that i am being ridiculous and it\'s only for my safety and security! Not true, look at china and see what it is about! I am not going to comply to this. I don\'t want to live in that kind of world period, do you? Social credit scores are next, we are on that slippery slop...', 'review_date': '2023-07-11', 'review_time': '04:39:14', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
