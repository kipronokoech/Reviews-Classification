We're on the same page, which is why we're passionately working towards making it free. While we're not quite there yet, we strive to charge as little as possible. Right now, we only ask for a tiny fee, and our ultimate goal is to make it free of charge.\n\nNo subscriptions, no monthly feesâ€”our approach is all about transparency. You'll always see the fee upfront, and you'll only pay for what you use. However, it's worth noting that with wire transfers, your bank typically charges their own fee, which is not imposed by Wise. The exact fee will depend on your bank and account type.\n\nIf you have any questions or need help, feel free to reach out to us through our contact page at https://wi.se/contactus_ or hit us up on Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram.

Extended holds on ACH', 'message': "Wise has recently started to claim that ACH transfers take a week to reach them. So any transaction you make with them won't be any quicker than a week. This is of course not true, an ACH transfer takes a couple hours and in the worst case a couple days if you initiate it over the weekend. In essence they take your money and sit on it for a week. It is quite convinient that this just started happening after all these years right when we enter a high yield interest rate enviornment. They are taking your money and collecting interest on it, interest that should be yours. In the meantime they unnecessarily delay your transaction. This is not just unethical but it is in fact illegal and I would be surprised if this doesn't get reported to the financial authorities. We are ending our long lasting relationship and moving on. Don't bother with their shady practices.\n\nUpdate to their response: We have done ACH funding with Wise for years and the transaction was almost instantaneous. In fact one would receive a confirmation message after each transaction saying the funds should reach the recipient shortly. This was followed by a confirmation email within seconds stating that the transaction/transfer has been completed. All this has been replaced and instead now you get a message stating that there will be hold or waiting period on your funds. At least have the decency not to lie in a public forum.", 'review_date': '2023-06-26', 'review_time': '13:10:34', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nJun 26, 2023\nHi there,\n\nAs a regulated financial institution, we assure you that we're committed to transparency and providing accurate information. We don't conduct any illegal activities, and we'd like to shed some light into how ACH transfers work.\n\nWhen you pay with your connected bank account (ACH) it typically takes up to 4 working days for the funds to reach us, and you'll usually see the debit in your bank account within 2â€“3 working days of initiating the transfer. Since it can take some time for the money to reach us, be sure you have enough money in your account while you wait for the debit.\n\nTo learn more about the ACH debit process, you can visit this link: https://wi.se/achdebit\n\nIf you have any other questions or need help, don't hesitate to reach out to us through our contact page at https://wi.se/contactus_ or on Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram.
