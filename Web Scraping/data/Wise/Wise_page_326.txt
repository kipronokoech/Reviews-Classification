We are no strangers to international funds transfer on online trading platforms. Firstly, at the top of the process, there is a note that there will be no charge for a bank transfer. Later you discover that they will charge you ($A13 in our case). Then they collect all your banking and ID info. Then you enter their banking details, and WISE provides you with a reference and bank account number. That's about it. No SWIFT/international routing info, no recipient bank address or contact details etc. My Australian banking app just gave me a funny look, me trying to effect an international transfer to Indonesia without the most elementary information. Wasted more than half an hour of my time on this nonsense.", 'review_date': '2023-05-14', 'review_time': '14:09:06', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nMay 15, 2023\nHi Herr,\n\nWe're sorry to hear that your experience with us wasn't ideal, and we appreciate you taking the time to share your feedback. We understand that international fund transfers can sometimes be confusing, so let's try to address your concerns.\n\nFirstly, we apologize if there was any confusion regarding the bank transfer fee. Transparency is one of our main pillars and our fees will always be displayed upfront, so it's possible there may have been a misunderstanding.\n\nRegarding the collection of your banking and ID information, we take the security and privacy of our customers very seriously. This information is required to comply with regulatory standards and protect your funds. Rest assured that we have robust security measures in place to safeguard your data.\n\nIn terms of the transfer process, if you're sending money from Australia to Indonesia, it's a straightforward and direct transfer. You don't need to add the money to your Wise account first. More about how to send money here: https://wi.se/howtosendmoney_\n\nFor specifics about the currencies, check these: https://wi.se/guidetoaud_ and https://wi.se/idrtransfers\n\nIf you'd like to first add the money to your Wise account, there's also no need to do it with a SWIFT code, which is why we didn't offer you one. More info here: https://wi.se/addmoneytoyourbalances_\n\nWe understand that your Australian banking app may have raised some eyebrows, but rest assured that Wise is a trusted and reliable service for international transfers. If you have other questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to us here: https://wi.se/contactus_ or Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram with your email and user number.
