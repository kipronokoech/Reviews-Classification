It took several months to get my money back. Funds are 100% legitimate, the proof of source can be provided. Based on my experience, this is definitely NOT A TRUSTWORTHY BANK. I am speechless with the bank's service and useless customer service team.\n\nWhat happened:\n\nI wanted to exchange british pounds. I used one of my own accounts to pay USD into my TransferWise account (with US account number and routing number). There wasn't any problem transferring money between high street banks before. However, the payment failed. My TransferWise account was deactivated with immediate notice.\n\nI contacted TransferWise to appeal, but their decision remained the same. Although they refused to disclose the reason, I believed it was imposible to be my problem. Because I was transferring funds between MY OWN ACCOUNTS and they didn't allow me to do it?!\n\nEventually, I had to get back the money that remained in my TransferWise account through Financial Ombudsman Service. It took several months. During the period, my account was frozen, and TransferWise didn't help with anything.\n\nThe worst bank I've ever used.", 'review_date': '2022-01-06', 'review_time': '23:07:40', 'CompanyReply': 'Reply from Wise\nJan 27, 2022\nHello George,\n\nWe understand having your account closed is frustrating, but rest assured this is never done without a reason.
