We appreciate your thoughts, and we're here to help address your concerns.\n\nTo clarify, changing your account address is indeed possible if you've moved. You can easily do it through our app or website. However, depending on the circumstances, we might need some documents to verify your new address. You can find more information about this process here: https://wi.se/change_delivery_address\n\nOnce your address is updated and verified, you can then order a new card to your new country of residence, if we offer our card service there. You can check the available card regions on our website: https://wi.se/cardregions\n\nIf you have any other questions or need help, please reach out to us.

No problem. I have a government issued ID.\n\nAnd according to Wise, they accept a government issued ID. As they should: (cannot link but search for their article 2949801 - how does wise verify my identity)\n\nSo I started the process.\n\nThey force you to deposit money first. 84 NIS - which corresponded to $23.23 when taken from Payoneer.\n\nI paid.\n\nThen in the next step, I uploaded the scans of my ID, front and back.\n\nNot accepted.\n\nTried again. Not accepted.\n\nTried again. Same thing.\n\nContacted support.\n\nThey told me:\n\n"We couldn’t verify your identity with the document you sent us because it’s in a language we don’t support."\n\nThen maybe they should either do better or update their site to say that it only supports Latin letters?\n\nOr maybe they shouldn\'t force people to pay their fee first before they show that they don\'t keep their promises?\n\nThey accept passports - but I don\'t travel, I don\'t have a passport. And I don\'t plan to get one for approx. $220 just to please Wise.\n\nNow I just hope they\'ll pay my fees back. I\'ll lose the fees I paid to Payoneer (another bad service I was trying to escape with Wise) and I\'ll pay more fees to Payoneer for getting the refund, so yeah, this has been a waste of time and money.\n\nI wish I\'d gone to Trustpilot first.\n\nUPDATE\n\nTheir support is ridiculous and don\'t read your answers. They haven\'t refunded my payment yet and they keep saying the same things which I\'ve already replied to.\n\nI told them:\nI don\'t have a passport - I don\'t travel\nI don\'t have a driver\'s license - I don\'t drive\n\nAnd they tell me... no, let me show you (he\'s by the way writing his name in two different ways):\n\n[supporter name spelled in one way removed] (Wise)\n\nJun 5, 2023, 11:57 UTC\n\nHello Britt,\n\nThanks for getting back to us.\n\nOf course, you can activate Wise account details to receive money from others.\n\nI see that you\'ve uploaded few documents which were in native language and also uploaded passport,\n\nAs per the FAQ of Guide to getting verified in it is stated that "Make sure the document isn’t in Arabic, Aramaic, Azerbaijani, Hebrew or Urdu text — we don’t have the resources to support these." hence the native language ID wasn\'t accepted.\n\nYour passport was rejected as your name is quite different in passport from the name in Wise profile.\n\nThe name on the ID and bank account where the money is coming from has to match your name on Wise.\n\nIf this was typo error and you want to fix this typo on your name, click here to upload a valid ID or you can attach it to this email.\n\nWe accept the following types of ID:\n\nPassport (photo page only)\n\nNational ID card\n\nPhoto of driver\'s license — front and back\n\n\nWhen you’ve uploaded your ID, just reply to this email to let us know.\n\nIf you have any other questions let us know or you can also check out our Help Centre\n\nRegards,\n[supporter name spelled in another way removed]\nWise\n\nUpdate 2:\n\nStill no refund from Wise. They are completely untrustworthy.\n\nUpdate 3 (7 days later):\n\nStill no refund.\n\nPlus I got this email practically saying that they cannot refund me because they don\'t have my ID... which I\'ve given them but which their lame bot doesn\'t accept:\n\nQuote:\n\n##- Please type your reply above this line -##\nHello Britt,\nThanks for getting in touch!
