I like your service, your web and mobile app, everything is nice looking and works fine! The reason why I'm giving you 4 stars instead of 5 is because I think that maybe you should work more on security.\n\nFew months ago I had a situation that someone hacked my account and took off all my money and I didn't even know that! I fond that out when I wanted to pay the receipt at the grocery store. Luckily, I had great support from your team, and my money got back on my account in less than 12 hours I think. Honestly, I didn't expect it would be so fast, and I can say only GREAT JOB! So maybe you should think about making a 2-step or 3-step login and paying by card, and make everything more safe.\n\nThank you!", 'review_date': '2020-12-09', 'review_time': '07:20:08', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

I next transferred money to an individual in Italy and got a good exchange rate, and low fee (beat my Chase Wire transfer by over $50). However, trouble then started. I wanted to send another individual in Italy money, but my transfer was blocked, saying that my money source was a trust, which they consider a business. This, even though the first transfer went through. I obtained a letter from my bank stating that I did not have a business account...waste of time, so I had the money refunded. As a final blow, to close my account I sent the initial $20 back to myself and they subtracted a fee! If they would only change their crazy policy over personal trusts, they could be great. I lost several days in trying to get this funds transfer done and finally had to go with Chase on the 2nd transfer.', 'review_date': '2020-12-09', 'review_time': '00:32:11', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nDec 10, 2020\nThanks for your review, we appreciate feedback of all kinds.\nWe sending money with us, we can only accept payments from your bank account.
