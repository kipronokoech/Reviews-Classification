Maintaining a reliable cash flow is crucial to our operations, and this unforeseen change had a substantial impact during a crucial period of the year.\n\nWe primarily rely on Shopify Payments for processing payments on our online store, which operates on a weekly disbursement schedule. Unfortunately, we received notice of the account details change with just five days' notice, causing an immediate impact on the timely reception of our funds. To make matters worse, the communication indicated that funds would be returned to the sender, further delaying the availability of our much-needed cash.\n\nWe've reached out to Shopify for assistance, but have faced challenges in receiving a substantive response. Additionally, the new bank details provided were incompatible with Shopify Payments due to an unrecognized routing number. This issue remains unresolved, and we're in a state of uncertainty about when normal operations can resume.\n\nThis situation has placed our business in a precarious position. Despite repeated communication with support, responses have been mixed, and we've encountered limited empathy and technical expertise in addressing the routing number issue. While some consultants provided helpful documents for communication with Shopify, a commitment to escalate the matter and follow up was not fulfilled.\n\nI firmly believe that a more generous grace period and advance notice would have greatly mitigated the consequences of this change. Such abrupt actions towards valued customers are inconsistent with the principles of customer care and professionalism.\n\nI would definitely think twice about using Wise as a reliable platform to run a business.\n\nUpdated review:\n\nIt appears that Wise was aware of the problem and was able to resolve it in the end. We are now back online, and everything seems to be functioning smoothly. Nevertheless, the experience was far from ideal for a business owner to endure. I'm still uncertain whether a similar issue might recur. Having acknowledged this, it's worth noting that Wise boasts one of the most robust infrastructures for handling multiple currency banking on the Internet. I may consider giving them another opportunity, albeit cautiously.", 'review_date': '2023-10-21', 'review_time': '09:06:17', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

Very easy to use and navigate.\n\nWith that said, the sign up process and verification is a PAIN and I'm questioning my decision to sign up. On sign up you provide your licence as identity verificiation. Then after a few transfers, they ask you to verify where the funds are coming from (all the while they block your transfers). As I said my source of income was from a salary, I was faced with providing 1 or a number of documents (employment contract/proof of employment/tax return). Keep in mind that these documents need to show 'signatures' which ignores the fact that most employers use docusign and employers only provide you with a copy of the contract. Anyways, as I'm on holidays and dont have the signed copy of my employment contract (only the copy) I was forced to provide my Tax Return. Guess what?? This document wasn't enough. I was then asked to provide 'proof of location' in the form of a bill.\n\nLong story short - don't sign up for this product if you're already on holiday and do not have access to any of these key documents on had otherwise you'll be stuck with not being able to transfer or access any money. I made the mistake of starting this process whilst already on holiday as I thought it was easier than using cash.\n\nIf you have access to 'international cash card' through your bank, I'd go with that rather than Wise, even if the rates might not be 'as good' - for the amount of run around I've had to go through whilst trying to enjoy my holiday has not been worth it.\n\nFor context, I've worked in financial services industry (both banks and insurance) in Australia for over 20years and understand the regulations for opening a bank account and this process goes above and beyond for identity verification and what would be reportable for anti money laundering (AML) act and foriegn affairs and terrorism (DFAT).", 'review_date': '2023-10-18', 'review_time': '15:34:08', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nOct 19, 2023\nHey Matthew,\nWe’re a regulated financial institution, so we should know who’s using our service, why they're using it, and that their money comes from a legitimate place.
