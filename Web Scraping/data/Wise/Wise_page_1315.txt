I received transfer notice from my niece saying she sent me money through her Hungarian bank for the 2 houses I sold to her. Days later comes the bad news that my US Bank did not accept it. I go to my bank and they said it was send in Hungarian forint HUF which is why it was not accepted. My niece lives in a tiny village of 70 people and her tiny bank is 30 miles away and can access them only her day off Mondays. I suggested to her to sign up to Wise. She said she rather go to her bank. She asked me to send her money ( I did and it took 2 minutes through WISE) so her bank can use that info to send me money. Seeing the quickness and despite my suggestion for her to sign up to Wise SHE STILL WANTS TO GO THROUGH HER BANK. The Tiny Problem IS that WISE is UNBELEIVABLE!!!!! My Niece rather go to her bank on her day off wasting her time and spending on gas than sit by her computer when the family went to sleep and take a couple of minutes to go step by step and type in the answers in COUPLE of minutes...I SEE a commercial....my niece's way 2 hours, WISE's way 2 minutes...WISE makes money transfer UNBELIEVABLE!!!", 'review_date': '2022-08-01', 'review_time': '01:01:05', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
