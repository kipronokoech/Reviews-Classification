It should be made clearer that the top field is for the sender with the denomination of the currency he or she is using to fund the transaction, and the bottom field is for the amount and denomination of the money the recipient will receive. In addition, the fee structiure is unclear. Iss there an ACH fee and a wire transfer fee? Does the ACH fee also apply to debit and credit card fees? On the positive side, the Wise support team was very timely with it\'s replies to my email inquiries. Finally, I encountered the expression "set up payment"in an error message. I didn\'t realize that it was referring to the first screen in the process, as mentioned above. Perhaps, the error message could be expanded to indicate that there may be an error on the first screen.', 'review_date': '2022-09-16', 'review_time': '03:57:39', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nUpdated Sep 16, 2022\nHello, Joseph\n\nThanks a lot for the feedback!\n\nOur developers have tried to make our interfaces as user-friendly as possible, but there's always room for improvement.\n\nFor clarification the top part, where it's written ‚Äúyou send‚Äù is the amount and the currency you're sending. The bottom part, where is written ‚Äúthe recipient gets‚Äù is the amount that the person you're sending money is going to get after the fees are deducted.\n\nA good tip is that if it‚Äôs important that your recipient gets an exact amount, type that amount into the Recipient gets (the bottom) box. We‚Äôll automatically tell you how much you need to send.\n\nThe part in between the two boxes are for the fees.\nThe cost of your transfer depends on several factors: the currencies you use, the payment method you choose, and the current market exchange rate. We explain in more detail how our commissions work here: https://wi.se/ourfees_\n\nEvery payment method has different fees, so the ACH has their own and so do debit/credit cards. If you want to calculate the fees for your transfer to get the cost, you can use our virtual calculator: https://wi.se/pricecalculator_\n\nWe're glad to see that you got help from our customer support and if anything we're always here for you at https://wi.se/contactus_ or on our social media channels.\n\nWise", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2022-09-16', 'CompanyReplyTime': '09:28:56'}

I have used it at least once a month for several years. It is VERY quick for smaller amounts (I can often transfer hundreds of dollars from the US to Mexico in a few seconds, sometimes it takes up to 2 hours); it only takes one or two days for transfers over a thousand dollars. MoneyGram sometimes has slightly better rates, but their transfers take about a week, so I MUCH prefer Wise. I also have a Euro account with Wise to transfer money to European countries.\n\nMy only complaint about Wise is that I can't (yet) transfer money from Mexico to the US. Hopefully they will add that currency combination soon. In the meantime, I use Global66 if I need to transfer money from my Mexican bank account to a US bank account.", 'review_date': '2022-09-15', 'review_time': '22:50:55', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

The money was sent back to us because there was a problem with the recipient's account. The payment was completed on our side, until it was rejected from their bank.\n\nWe mark your transfer ‚ÄúComplete‚Äù when we‚Äôve sent the money to the recipient bank. Which doesn't mean that it will be immediately on their account.\nSome banks are just slower than others ‚Äî they might take up to a few working days for them to release the money. So your money‚Äôs safely on its way, but the recipient bank is still processing it.\n\nFor future references we recommend sending a transfer receipt as a confirmation of the payment, so the seller knows that they can count on you.
