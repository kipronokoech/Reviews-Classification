It could be because the transfer was set up closer to the weekend/holidays, or because we needed to carry extra checks. You can read about it here: https://wi.se/whymytransferistakinglonger_\n\nIf you need help with a specific transfer, you can always contact us here: https://wi.se/contactus_ or Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram with your transfer number. We will gladly review and provide you with the necessary assistance.\n\n- Wise', 'CompanyReplyDate': '2023-04-13', 'CompanyReplyTime': '03:56:15'}

When I raise this with Wise they said they canâ€™t stop merchants from doing this. This seems dubious - plenty of other cards have systems in place to prevent this from happening.
