Our agents can all speak perfectly English - no matter their nationality - but if you're having issues, you can also email us or give us a call in your native language. We offer support in different languages as well.\n\nWe're not a scam, nor we have the intention to cause delays, however payments can be stopped at any point for additional checks. This is something we must do as a regulated financial institution, and support agents have no control over it. In fact, support agents can't process or speed up payments at all. They can share with you an update. If your transfer is paused because we need more information, it'll be released once all the checks are completed from our side.\n\nWise Team.", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2021-08-09', 'CompanyReplyTime': '12:26:12'}
