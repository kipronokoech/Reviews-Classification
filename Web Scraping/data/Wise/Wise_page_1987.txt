I did not rate 5 stars for the reason that there should be a more clear manual how to use it. Sometimes it is kind of complicated and not logical. So a manual would really help. I have used it to get money in from the USA (there the bank did not understand anything) and move money from a European Account, through Wise to another Wise account holder in Canada. Moving from Euros to Canadian Dollars. Finding another Wise account Holder through email was kind of unlogical. But it worked out very well, once you know what to do.
