As it's resolved in acceptable timeframe, I am giving 4 stars. The app and service is still superb. However, I really hope Wise can improve on customer support asap, as it's really a taunting experience having to wait days/weeks to get support for financial matters.\n\nOriginal Review:\nI've been using Wise for quite some time and I must say that its remittance service is fast and haven't fail once. Just when I starting to trust Wise more and putting my salary in, nightmare comes.\n\nWhat happened:\n1. On 5 July 2022, I transferred my salary into Wise currency account, and it exceeds the holding amount limit in Malaysia. (I didn't know about the holding limit at that time)\n2. On 6 July 2022, I received an email from Wise, informing me that I need to withdraw excess amount due to local regulations in Malaysia, WITHIN 7 DAYS. (Note that there's zero mentions about account deactivation)\n2. On 7 July 2022, I received the same email as previous.\n3. On 9 July 2022 (Satuday), in the early morning, I found my account deactivated after attempting to login. (Note that it's only been 3 days)\n4. On the same day 9 July 2022, I sent an email to wise appeals mail address, the only solution provided to me on wise.com.\n\nWise team, if you read this review, I NEED the money to live, it's my salary. I was trying to solve the holding limit within 3 Days, when the terms say I have 7 days to withdraw the excess amount. Please help me to undo the account deactivation. I've been a faithful Wise user and put a lot of trust in the Wise team.", 'review_date': '2022-07-19', 'review_time': '13:22:31', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
