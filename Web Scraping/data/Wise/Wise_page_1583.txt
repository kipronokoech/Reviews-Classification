We're here to serve our customers, and we're sorry to hear you feel the opposite way, Nimit.\n\nWhile our goal is to complete all payments as fast as we can, we’re a regulated financial institution and as such, we need to carry extra checks on transfers from time to time. This is a routine procedure to help us ensure we’re keeping our platform safe for everyone using (including you) while complying with local regulations.\n\nHopefully this gets sorted ASAP, but feel free to reach out anytime if you have any other questions.\n\nWise team", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2022-06-15', 'CompanyReplyTime': '10:00:00'}
