This is urgent situatiun that why I decided to share my condoleances fas family support and sent money on 17 September 2021 after paid with online banking Ideal to wise ( transferwise account) they wont sent it to my sister account with the reason that I should provide additional information about the name of sister, land and date of birth (option not obligatory to fill in). I found so strange based on privacy law there is none banking institution of financial institution allow to ask date of birth for recipient and my bank confirmed for need because my bank said that and never ask about date of birth for recipient. date of birt is something very personally and they can steal data everything based on date birth. Again based on privacy law it is NOT ALLOW to ask date of birth recipient and all the bank in Netherland never ask date of birth recipient and normally only bank account number, SWIFT/BIC Code for international transfer, the name of land that is enough to make transfer\nAgain transferwise sent me email and again strongly insisted me to provide date of birth of my sister. I asked my sister wheter she will give me permission but she won't and she afraid there is somthing wrong witj transferwise and could be hacker behind of this game who stel data everything. My sister has good job as goverment employee at University thats why she was objected to give personal information such date of birth. Of course I can understand her. Due of this problem I had on 18 september 2021 requested to cancel my transaction and requested refund or give my money back to my account . But transferwise replied en insisted for me to provide date of birth my sister agaian and again which is really annoying and very suspicious.\nI do not get any refund until now because everytime I contact transferwise via email and chat and again they replied that I must provide date of birt my sister.I keep struggle for this because thats my money, transferwise still keep my money until now. I sent many emais and complained many times but transferwise just ignored it and do not get my money until now.\nI would never recommend transferwise for you, watch out er is something wrong with transferwise and I suspect now wise or transferwise become parter of world cyber crime to steal your money . Please consider this review otherwise you gonna same experience like me . Strongly not recomend transferwise and be careful take care for your money because hacker and world crime cyber is watch of you and waiting to steal your money. I had already in diificult and condoleance situation because my mother dead but still transfwise take advantage for my situation to steal my money. If someone want to steal your money who care if you are condoleance of very sadness its all about money and money! Watch out and DO NOT USE Wise (transferwise)\nYou replied for cancelation,, ITS AL READY CANCELLED BUT YOU DO NOT GIVE ME REFUND UNTIL NOW!!WHY YOU ARE SO STUPID READ CAREFUL:LY THE TITTLE AND WHAT I SAID HERE!!STUPID REACTION FROM SCAMMER WISE DAT STILL KEEP MY MONEY UNTIL NOW!!IT S CANCELLED SINCE 17-09-2021.
