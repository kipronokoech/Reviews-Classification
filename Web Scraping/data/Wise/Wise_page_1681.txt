Before starting, I did a lot of investigation to assess which method (e.g. use my bank's services) might be quickest/safest/cheapest etc. Wise was the clear winner: best conversion rate by far, lowest charge, and very quick. The FAQs also addressed my various concerns very clearly, and the whole process worked very smoothly once I started the process: from start to being received at the other end was about 24 hours. The updates I received about progress of the transfer were most reassuring.
