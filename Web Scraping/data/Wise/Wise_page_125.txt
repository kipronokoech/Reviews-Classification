The person from Wise also informed me , that if we don\'t comply\nWise will "send back" out money ... Since the email from Wise employee was written in Polish (probably translated via "google translate or simlar software")\nand the person wasn\'t Polish, I asked for clarification of what they meant by saying "send back our money". Never got a reply to this email so far, so I filed a complaint in which I also asked for clarification of what they meant by saying Wise would send back our company money, as this would obviosly cause us to face serious financial loss ...\nAlso I asked for a proper law paragraph based on which they demand to put my personal details onto our company "contact section" informing Wise, I would not comply unless they provide me with this information\n\n\nI never got a reply to my email, but instead on 11/08 I received another email from Wise,this time anonymously signed from "Wise Team" saying that our company is not fit anyonger for Wise,\nas it breaches Wise\'s T&C by offering trips to shooting ranges and lap dance club entries. Obviously they way the worded it sounded like we were trading guns on black market and offering prostitution. Funny enough, they didnt consider our services "unethical" for many years, until I dared to ask them for clarification of their demands and threats...\n\nFollowing this email, I decided to move our money from Wise, as they called us to do so, before they close our account in a "month time" (and yes, this is the exact wording they used- \'in a month time" without even taking some effort to let us know whether they consider a month 30 days or 31 days !)\nUp to my surprise, when I tried to send the money to a different bank account of ours, Wise blocked the transfer informing me that "someone from their team is personally checking us now and the issue should be resolved within 24hrs". So I waited 24hrs and then got information that they are sorry, but it will take longer, and that I should be available by email, because they might need to contact me with regards to us moving our money from our account...\n\nI\'m in the point where I\'m really streed, as I\'m leaving on holidays tomorrow till mid September, and won\'t have access to company emails...\nNot to mention that I had to use my personal funds to pay for the company costs and salaries, since I can\'t use company money, since Wise is now deliberately blocking it.\n\nTo call this a mess would be a huge compliment to Wise, so please mark my words and be wise by STAYING AWAY FROM WISE', 'review_date': '2023-08-17', 'review_time': '18:27:11', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
