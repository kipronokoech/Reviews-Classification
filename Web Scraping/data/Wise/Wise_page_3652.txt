It has also been a pleasure to take money away from banks. Their 'rate' always added on at least five percent to the cost and the process was not at all transparent. I would press a few buttons on my European bank account to send to the UK, and only days later would the money arrive in the UK without any statement of the conversion rate. Even phone calls to my UK bank couldn't sort that out. I had to look at the newspapers' posted exchange rate at roughly the dates the money was being moved across the Channel, calculate roughly what the euros ought to have been traded at, and then I counted up the difference between that sum and what arrived in my UK bank account. To send 3,000 euros, I was losing at least 150 euros in the rate alone, and to that was added the transfer charges and other settlement fees. A quick search online and it turned out that Transferwise was already up and running and totally transparent. The moment you send, you know exactly what the fees are -- about a tenth of what the banks charge. It's a simple whack-a-mole system. No money actually leaves any country, except within the European Union. Put euros into the euro pot in Europe, bring the equivalent in sterling out of the Transferwise pot in the UK. The pounds are often in my UK bank account in just a few seconds. Within the EU, though, a transfer from Transferwise to a Slovak bank and vise versa can take a day. Within Germany, the transfer is immediate.\n\nThe Transferwise interface has been at times a bit too minimalist but once learned, it's fast and easy.\n\nThey also offer a debit card which I am looking forward to using next time I leave the UK. On getting back to the UK after my last trip I was unpleasantly surprised at the hidden conversion costs of using a pounds-denominated debit card. One charge for using the card, another charge for converting...\n\nThe 'Contact' page feature is also much more 'personal' than the FAQ pages of bigger companies in other sectors, which always fob off the customers with chase-your-tail 'find your own answer'. As Transferwise has grown, getting in touch is no longer as quick and immediate as it used to be, but it's still one-to-one if need be.", 'review_date': '2021-01-06', 'review_time': '12:38:22', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
