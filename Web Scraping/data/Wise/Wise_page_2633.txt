Up to this moment, I have wired and collected money. I have always saved money when compared with the bank I have been a customer of for almost ten years, shame on my bank. The best part is that this company only tells you that they are good because you have saved time and money based on the exchange rate when in fact I have saved a lot if we take into account the bank fees on international transfers. In these three years, I have never had to contact their customer service. I am very pleased and hope that the service gets better and better and I am not forced to come back here and change my review. thanks", 'review_date': '2021-10-28', 'review_time': '15:54:17', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

The service has always been very easy to use, exchange rate is clearly shown along with the fee (which does vary depending on the method of payment used), and extremely efficient - for me, it takes literally seconds to arrive in my EUR account. I have used another service for a large transfer and the saving made by using them instead of Wise was barely enough to pay for a meal in a decent restaurant.

This is totally ridiculous. I haven't even used it on anything yet it got locked for no reason. ¬£215 is not too much but it is a lot for me and I can not accept the fact that they take the money so obvious.
