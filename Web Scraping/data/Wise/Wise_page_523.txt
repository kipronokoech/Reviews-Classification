Please mind that any regulated financial institution has the right to carry out compliance related checks in order to confirm who is sending/receiving money and why. This is to ensure that Wise is safe and secure for everyone on it.\n\nIt doesn't mean that something is wrong with your account, however processing these checks is a legal requirement and therefore cannot be avoided. We have the following section in our Customer Agreement agreed by you upon opening of your Wise account: https://wise.com/terms-of-use\n\nWe always aim to make this process as fast and smooth as possible. Here's also a list of documents we do accept: https://wi.se/sow-documents\n\nPlease know that we never close accounts for no reason. It's normally a result of a conflict with our Terms of Service or Customer Agreement, or due to a discrepancy with a financial law. We can't share the exact reason of the deactivation, due to how we're regulated. However, you can find some possible reasons here wi.se/accountdeactivation.\n\nIf you're not happy with this decision, you can appeal here https://wi.se/-appeal, and our appeals team will reach out to you once they have further updates regarding your account. Please keep in mind that this process might take up to 30 working days.\n\nAs for your remaining money in your account, we'll work on sending it back to you. But first, we need to carry out due diligence checks. While we do that, your money and information will be safe and secure.\n\nWise", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2023-01-16', 'CompanyReplyTime': '10:55:19'}

I used Wise every month as I basically live in two countries but only make my money in one of them. On 14.12.2022 I received an email stating that I would have to provide proof of where my money comes from by 9.1.2023 or my account would stop working. Being self employed, I do not have the "normal" things they suggested like employment ontract, payslips etc. so I set to work uploading all my tax returns and documentation which clearly showed my taxable income and company ownership i.e. my taxes were based upon that company\'s income. The same day 14.12 I received an email saying the documents were approved. Clicking the notification in the App now stated that they had everything they needed. From 14.12 until 13.1 I heard nothing and then suddenly came an email to say my account was suspended and that I needed to provide proof of where my income is from. Rather annoyed I set about downloading bank statements, tax and company registration and uploaded these documents. I then received an email to say the bank statements were not acceptable as they had been highlighted. I highlighted payments from the company to me on the Business Account and likewise on my personal account. This highlighting apparently is not acceptable but nowhere did it state that and it clearly states they need to know where my money comes from. Having shown them PRECISELY where it comes from, they state that this is not acceptable. I found the whole thing completely absurd. I have used the account since early 2017 in exactly the same way, with pretty much no issues. Now suddenly I am guilty of money laundering until I prove my innocence despite me going over and above what they reasonably should need to judge my status and see that my business with them is completely above board. I will give them a few days to get their act together otherwise I will close my account and carry out my monthly international transfers through a company that respects me as a customer and doesn\'t treat me like a criminal when I go out of my way to provide them with requested info. Whilst the service offered works well, I would NOT recommend a company that can suddenly treat its customers in this way.', 'review_date': '2023-01-14', 'review_time': '04:33:33', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nJan 19, 2023\nHello,\n\nWe're sorry to hear that your experience with us hasn't been the best lately.
