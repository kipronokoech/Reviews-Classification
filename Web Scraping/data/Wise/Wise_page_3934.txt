{'platform': 'Wise', 'id': '5f90050d798e6f0aa0aa8fad', 'stars': 2, 'title': 'Transferwise, in addition to......', 'message': "Transferwise still merits consideration, though in some respects it's now falling behind competitors. The range of facilities is good and charges acceptable. When you have understood the way to go about things - often their logic is not explained for the layman, AND, they presume too much 'common knowledge' – and things work, they are likely to work reasonably and quickly.\n\nHowever, what they should make abundantly clear is they are very very centric to mobile devices and Chrome. If this is not you and things work consider yourself lucky. If things don’t work or stop working, expect that Transferwise can’t help – if you can reach them by phone.\n\nWhen you login you may get a hideous ‘captcha’ screen. That’s the tiny indistinct pictures you have to tick you establish you’re human. Problems are sometimes you can’t make out what qualifies, where a tiny bit of something encroaching onto a second pic qualifies that for a tick, and, of course, it’s American. As there is another layer of security, why is this needed?\n\nThe other security layer is to send you a one-time pass code. But, despite this originally being a computer based system, the code cannot be emailed to you, but texted to your phone? You can opt to have this sent by voice which is fine if you’re by your regular real ‘on the table’ phone, but what if you’re not. As Transferwise believe the whole world works according to their limited and juvenile experience, everybody MUST have a mobile??? The customer does what Transferwise wants as they do nothing for the customer. If I ran the company I might insist people log on with their Ford VIN number. After all, everyone I know drives and drives a Ford! You mean some people don’t? And what’s this got to do with a computer based financial system? Nothing at all which is the same as pretending everyone has a mobile device!\n\nI deal with 5 serious financial institutions, all involving vastly more sums of mine than Transferwise ever deals with. NONE of these require the Transferwise nonsense. One involves deciphering 6 altered characters, and the other 5 ask me to specify characters from a secret word I set down. All of this accomplished from a single device anywhere in the world I might be. Nothing requires using one the most stolen devices in the world, especially one which is typically snatched while in use and therefore open and unlocked – i.e. the mobile phone.\n\nAnd, if you suddenly find you can’t use the system – i.e. do what YOU want with YOUR money WHEN you want – you can’t phone up and make your transaction over the phone. This I find totally unacceptable and quite possibly the FCA does too.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\nREPLY TO TRANSFERWISE\nAbsolutely not! Pointless to waste more time getting absolutely nowhere with your ‘token staff’.\n\nI’ve set everything out very clearly and all you’ll do is rummage though your BS answers for customers instead of providing what we want – SERVICE!\n\nYou are totally centric to mobile devices and Chrome. You have no inclination or facility for anything else, which of course saves you money.\n\n1. Allow customers to choose to have a security code emailed to them, or provide characters from their secret ‘word’.\n\n2. Instate a facility to allow customers to phone and make transfers to at least established recipients.\n\nFailing that accept you are not as good as you pretend to be and BE HONEST with customers!", 'review_date': '2020-10-26', 'review_time': '16:26:42', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nOct 26, 2020\nHi there.
