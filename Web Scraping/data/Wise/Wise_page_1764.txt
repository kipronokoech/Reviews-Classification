Wise has simplified the process of sending and receiving money across borders, and I couldn't be more satisfied with my experience.\n\nFrom the start, setting up my account was straightforward, and the user-friendly interface made navigating the platform a breeze. What truly sets Wise apart is its transparency and fair exchange rates. I appreciate knowing exactly how much money will be received on the other end, without any hidden fees or surprises.\n\nOver the years, I've used Wise for various purposes, including personal transfers and business transactions. Each time, the platform has delivered a smooth and secure experience. The ability to track my transfers in real-time and receive notifications at every step of the process has been invaluable in providing peace of mind.\n\nOne of the standout features for me is the Borderless Account, which allows me to hold multiple currencies and switch between them effortlessly. This has proven to be a game-changer, especially when dealing with international clients and partners.\n\nCustomer support deserves special mention. Whenever I've had a question or needed assistance, the Wise team has been prompt, knowledgeable, and friendly in resolving my queries.\n\nIn a world where financial services can be complex and often frustrating, Wise shines as a beacon of simplicity and reliability. It has become an essential tool in my international financial dealings, and I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone seeking a hassle-free and cost-effective way to manage cross-border transactions.

But from 2022 I have been constantly in touch with TransferWise to get my funds released, because I have had thousands of dollars stuck because they were "checked" on both my UK and US business accounts, and it took well over a week or two before I receive the money.\n\nAnd and checks happen too often now for no reason, their customer service always says it is random, but I don\'t think mine is random since it happens all the times.\n\nFintech is definitely a bad choice for business usage, better use an actual bank to reduce this kind of outrageous "checks" that take a week or two before you can even see the money being displayed on the account.\n\nI even had to ask my client if they sent me the money, because when the transfers in are being checked, you can\'t find it on the website. It is only in TransferWise\'s system. AND THEY NEVER HAVE AN OPTION TO FINISH THE "CHECK" PROCESS QUICKLY. They always say there is nothing they can do and they will escalate to the checking team, pure corporate crap. Never gonna use TransferWise. Used to be good, now TransferWise is garbage.\n\nUPDATE:\n1 day after publishing this comment, I decided to pay the entire balance on both my UK and US companies to myself and quit Wise, guess what??\n"We\'re running some checks"\nSo plus the 2 incoming checks which have been held for a week now, I have tens of thousands of dollars being stolen by Wise now.\n\nAnd their customer service is almost non-existent, email no reply, online message not online all the times (in 2020 they used to be online everyday and offered immediate responses), and only calls have an answer but even that is limited to certain hours.\n\nWise, f your checks, f your customer service team and your corporate bs languages, f your decaying product, f your crappy service, and yes, it is personal.\n\nPretty sure scam artist company like yours will see your stocks collapse after you go IPO.

They are probably just fulfilling some type of regulatory requirement, by offering customer assistance.\n\n\nFor this reason alone, many times I would have immediately pulled the plug on them except that I’m abroad and don’t have the ability to open more bank accounts right now.\n\nMeanwhile the list of financial institutions they won’t work with is long and awful.\n\nIf you want to use your Wise account to move money into basically any other payment provider, out of luck. Same with a number of large banks, both domestic and international.\n\n\nI hope they can change.
