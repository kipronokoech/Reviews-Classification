These include the way you paid for the transfer, the currency you paid with, and how long your bank takes to process refunds.\n\nIf you paid by credit or debit card, the refund can usually take up to 10 working days to go back into your account. The reason it can take so long is because both our provider and the bank that issued your card need to process the refund.\n\nWise', 'CompanyReplyDate': '2022-05-05', 'CompanyReplyTime': '12:31:41'}

Note: One can't see can't see or verify that profile data. I did a few small transfers and loved the level of service, but then when I was confident you worked - I transferred a big amount. You correctly asked for photo ID, and I provided it, and you put a hold on the transfer because the birthdates didn't match. I provided additional ID and explained your mistake, and was told told it will be fixed in a few days. A few days later, I asked for an update, and was told a repeat of my first support encounter, (that my birthdate didn't match, etc.), and I again provided proof and an explanation of your error, and was again told it would be fixed in a few days. It's now approaching 5 days from when this transfer was initiated, and it's still not moving.\n\nMeanwhile, I have a lease I can't pay because my money is locked in limbo. It's frustrating that you show so much potential, but fail so horribly when I need you most. I have no issue with the need for validation, or even that errors can occur during account creation. My issue is that when an error occurs, especially if it's your error, I don't know whether it's getting fixed, or whether I'd make quicker progress cancelling the transfer, closing my account, and using a different service. I really want to work with you, but getting the same boiler plate support answer (I'll have the team fix it, and it should be fine in a few days...) doesn't inspire confidence when you're holding $100K of my money.", 'review_date': '2022-05-05', 'review_time': '15:59:32', 'CompanyReply': 'Reply from Wise\nMay 5, 2022\nHello Charles,\n\nWe see that this is already with the relevant team.\n\nWhen you open a bank account, you usually need to provide documents to verify details about yourself.
