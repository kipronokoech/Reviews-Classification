For example, repeat an old payment, what does that mean? Pay the same amount from your end or the same amount to the recipient? Due to currency fluctuations these two possibilities are not the same thing.\nIn another situation I just send some money to the same company as I did before. However this company has ‚Äúa personal touch‚Äù which means that a particular staff member is assigned to each case. Changing the contact email on a payment with Wise requires entering a new company altogether rather than just changing an email address.\nNone of these things are serious problems and are easily worked around, but they cost a bit of extra brainpower to navigate.', 'review_date': '2021-07-10', 'review_time': '15:32:18', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
