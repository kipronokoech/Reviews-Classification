I have sent this evidence on numerous occasions\nWhen i finally found a way to talk to a person over the phone, I was said that my money had gone to a German Bank account unknown to Wise. This is most strange as i did the transfers from my account with Wise and not from my own Bank. My Wise account used my Bank details as registered with them . I had never had a problem until Transferwise changed to Wise. I argued to them that my Bank automatically recognized the transfer as Wise related and so it says on the Bank script.\nI was said that a formal complaint form would be sent to me immediately but I only heard from them by email eight days after stating that I could contact my local Dispute Body ( Ombudsfin.be ) if their response to my complaint was not of my agreement . Wise does not actually write on that email the details of the phone conversation.\nMore frustration added when I read on Ombudsfin.be website that their opinion wouldn´t be binding.\n\nTherefore Wise continuous to give repetitive negative answers to my complaint without responding to my problem.\n\nIncredibly frustrating as either they are gaining time whilst I miss two thousands euros and, it appears that I will have to go to court to recover my money', 'review_date': '2023-08-15', 'review_time': '00:31:55', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nAug 15, 2023\nHi Francisco,\n\nWe understand how this could be frustrating, but as a regulated financial institution, we can assure you that we're not seeking to gain time or anything of that sort.
