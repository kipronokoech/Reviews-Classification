I have never had to babysit a money app in my entire life but I have to do this with Wise. I will NEVER recommend this service to anyone. I'm only using this service because I'm in a foreign country and Wise is the only viable application available.\nApplication is frustrating and you must constantly watch it. My payments have been refunded multiple times and half the time I don't receive an email. I'd give zero starts if it was an option.\n\nUpdate 3/10/22: Yes Wise, the transfer was returned due to the bank. However if you took the time to understand the review above, the issue I’m having is the lack of communication from your service when there is an issue. I shouldn’t have to log in to my account constantly to make sure your application is doing what it’s supposed to. Again, 0/5 stars. I wouldn’t use your app if I had another option in the country I’m currently working in.\nThere's quite a few reviews complaining about customer service and I'm beginning to see why!!", 'review_date': '2022-03-10', 'review_time': '15:59:42', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nMar 10, 2022\nHello Jessica,\n\nYour last transfers were refused and sent back to us by the recipient's bank, when that happens, always double-check if you sent your payment using correct account details, if you've sent the correct currency, chose the correct account type, etc.\n\nIt's always best to check with your recipient, since this is their bank rejecting your payment.\n\nWise.", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2022-03-10', 'CompanyReplyTime': '09:23:03'}
