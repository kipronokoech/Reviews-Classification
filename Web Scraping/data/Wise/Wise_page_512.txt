{'platform': 'Wise', 'id': '63d102ae9b64b1bdaf42592c', 'stars': 2, 'title': "You'd be UNWISE.COM to use this company!", 'message': 'My experience of using wise.com for an overseas business transfer was very poor on two counts, but positive on a third count.\n\nI am writing here about what I consider to be misleading tactics.\n\nEvery business makes mistakes and I\'m a forgiving reviewer, but on this occasion the mistake seemed to be directed to get me to make a reasonably large bank account transfer before I knew the full story. I am concerned that this reflects poorly on the modern consumer financial market, which may be otherwise reputable; it does nothing to allay fears of embracing new technology and next time I\'ll stick with my dinosaur bank who charges a bit too much for an overseas payment, because at least I know I can TRUST them.\n\nUnfortunately it would appear that on the first count, wise.com does not comply with FCA Regulation Article 4 - Transparency of Fee Structures. I am not a legal professional but it would seem so to my understanding.\n\n1) I needed to send just over 1000 dollars to a supplier in the US and wished to avoid the high fees with my own UK business bank account. After comparing a few payment service providers I chose Wise.com to make the payment as their exchange rate and fees resulted in spending between £5-15 less than competitors. I didn\'t have any other parameters to base my decision on, e.g. loyalty to a brand - with the exception I didn\'t want to use Revolut as their roots are Russian and I do not wish to support that.\n\nI quickly created an account using my Google ID and went through the process of sending money to our supplier in the US (we are a UK company) using Wise.com. During the process at no point was I made aware of any mandatory sign-up fees. I proceeded with entering payee details and finally was given the wise.com account details to make a bank transfer from our business account to Wise, which would then be forwarded to the payee. This was the recommended / cheapest option.\n\nAs guided by the website, I transferred approx £900 to Wise.com from our business bank, and clicked "I have made the transfer".\n\nInstead of receiving a page saying "thanks for doing business with us" or "your transaction will be processed", it took me straight to a page asking me for a fee of £45 to complete the setup of my business bank.\n\nThis page did NOT say "your payment will be processed. Have you thought about setting up a business bank account with us?"\n\nThe strong implication was that this was required to complete the current process, i.e. of sending money overseas.\n\nAt no point did I request to set up a business bank account with wise.com, nor do I need to, NOR was I advised of any additional fees required to make this transfer. In fact fees were clearly shown in previous steps and did NOT include a £45 setup fee.\n\nThis resulted great nervousness on my part, as we had just sent a bank transfer to Wise.com for £900. Would I get this back? Also I had no apparent guarantee that the payment which was destined to our supplier would even be processed!\n\nTherefore I had to waste my time telephoning Wise.com to get clarification on the above.\n\n2) On a more positive note, there was no huge queue on the telephone and I was able to clarify with the person I spoke to relatively quickly and straightforwardly that the payment would be processed and this business account that seemed mandatory would not actually be required for this payment.\n\nNevertheless I would suggest this "Finish setting up your account and pay £45" which I was immediately directed to after being guided to make a bank transfer, was purposefully deceitful in that the strong implication was that this would be required to continue with the process of making the payment.\n\nSuch tactics could cause people to feel pressured into setting up an account and paying the fee, as they would be worried that the large bank transfer they just made might get lost. This is a very serious point, and could constitute a failing of the company to conform with Financial Conduct Authority regulations.\n\n3) I received an email shortly after, asking for feedback with the text "We would love to know how satisfied you were with your account creation experience. Everything you share with us, stays with us. We\'ll only use your answers to improve Wise."\n\nI clicked on the link as I wished to make my feelings on the above known, however I was astonished to be presented with a single question "how did you hear about us" and a submit button. That was it - no other questions.\n\nThis AGAIN is a misleading tactic, in this case to get you to give them information they need whilst completely disregarding anything you have to say as a customer.\n\nOn the basis of the above I would recommend using PaySend or another provider for overseas transactions. Although I have not personally used PaySend for a business transfer, my experience with them for personal overseas transfers was excellent.', 'review_date': '2023-01-25', 'review_time': '12:25:30', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
