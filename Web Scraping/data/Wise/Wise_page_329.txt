They are no trustworthy company any more. When I signed up I had to verify who I am. This is quite normal and worked well. I wasn’t happy with the often increased fees, but for years I was able to pay my bills without any problem - until in March my monthly payment to the Hungarian Tax Authority was cancelled. I contacted Wise and got the answer that they were unable to verify whether the tax office is serious enough to pay them money… I was allowed to start this payment again, but of course I will be fined for the late payment, although it is a small amount only and I did everything to pay in time.\n\nThe following month, April, the monthly scheduled payment happened without problem and now for May I had to top up my Hungarian Forint account with the gigantic amount of 32.49 €. Nothing I didn’t do before, but now Wise started a complete chaos. The 32.49 € was so much money that Wise wanted to see how I earned this and paused the transaction until I would have proven why I am so incredible rich to pay 32.49 €. I am no longer working and waiting for my pension. So I sent a recent statement from my broker showing both a dividend payment and the deduction of taxes. The amount wasn‘t huge, but exceeded 32.49 € by far and that’s what is needed according to the Wise help pages.\n\nSince Wise paused my top up they sent me a mail to fill up my Forint account for the upcoming payment, if I wouldn‘t they would cancel the transfer. I exchanged the needed amount from my Euro account, which happened without problem.\n\nFor Wise my broker statement over dividends was not enough. So I presented the broker’s financial yearly report over the entire year 2022. The investment shrunk during the year, but there is enough money available to continue easily living on the same level until my pension age. But for Wise it wasn‘t enough. They insisted on a tax return showing me paying taxes over living on savings in 2022. Not even the tax office wants me to pay taxes when living on savings, but Wise does.\n\nThe monthly payment to the tax office was paused by Wise as well. They want to see that I pay more taxes than needed, but the payment I undoubtedly owe the tax authority is halted. I decided to return my Euros held with Wise to my bank account where it came from and you guess it: Wise paused it until I prove taxing things I needn‘t to tax at all. I clearly stated that I want them to pay the tax office and me and to close the account afterwards.\n\nAs result I got the information that they closed the account, but also that they did stop all payments and that if I would hold any funds with them I need to log in and dispute it. Crazy idea that I need to dispute closing the account to get my money back, while I asked myself for closure. When I tried I had to log in - and you guess it: I wasn‘t allowed. But there was a link to help. Following the link provided there I got back to the log-in. Of course their email is noreply-only.\n\nWith other words: Wise wants to prohibit me claiming my money I hold with them. Not the tax authority is not serious as Wise claimed, they are!', 'review_date': '2023-05-12', 'review_time': '17:14:38', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
