Then?\nI sent money to my account in Malaysia. For some reason the bank bounced the money back. OK these things happen. I checked with my Malaysian bank "sorry we made a mistake, please send through the money again"\nI then contacted wise. Can you please send through the money again?\nWise\'s response "money? What money? Send us proof"\n\nSo back to the Malaysian bank. I got print-outs of everything. Sent it to wise. Wise\'s response "oh, that money. We will send again."\n\nOne week later, still nothing. I contact wise by email, no response. I call two different call centres for wise. Spend a long time with each one explaining the situation. Finally each one says "OK we will fix the issue." each time I wait a week. Nothing.\nI send another email. No response.\n\nFinally after TWO months the money reappears in my nz bank account. No explanation, no apologies. I contact wise again to ask what happened.\n\nWise replies "you have your money. What is your issue?"\n\nIt is when something goes wrong that is when you see how good a company is.', 'review_date': '2021-08-16', 'review_time': '08:20:26', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nAug 25, 2021\nHello, Nick.\n\nWe understand your concern when it comes to the safety of your money, but that doesn't sound like us at all. We take what we do very seriously, and keeping your money safe is part of that.\n\nIn the case your bank rejected the payment, but didn't inform us right away, we needed to wait for the bounce back. This isn't something we can speed up from our side, but a proof of payment/rejection can help us. However, we can only refund you once we receive your money back, and that can at times take a little longer.\n\nWise Team.", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2021-08-25', 'CompanyReplyTime': '07:24:18'}
