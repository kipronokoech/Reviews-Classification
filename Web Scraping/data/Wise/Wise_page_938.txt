Therefore it is much more laborious to wire to Wise then to wire directly to my beneficiary.\nSecondly, Wise cannot send money to accounts at JPMorgan Chase because Wise does not recognize the ABA routing number 021000021.\nI used to use Wise all the time and found it easy, fast and useful. Now it's a big hassle to use. I wasted a lot of time and never was able to send money.\nDo you think these problems can be resolved?", 'review_date': '2022-10-12', 'review_time': '04:50:17', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

The other option was "confirm by text or call," HA. Can\'t do that either. And finally, WhatsApp which I thought might be my saving grace, but it turns out they only use the single cell# you have on file and my WhatsApp is under an old number. This is all despite having my correct username and password, by the way. In the name of added security. Ridiculous.
