I will start using my old Bank account to receive GBP and Revolut to receive Euros and use their card to pay for my expenses over in the EU. I wish I could tell Not So Wise CEO what I think really about the S**T service they are now providing me.\nOn Monday I made an urgent payment to a Customs agent , it was urgent because due to problems in the ferry terminal of Portsmouth I hade a lorry load held up for the night for wrong customs paperwork and needed new forms sent to the driver urgently, it took WISE 20 minutes to transfer £192.57 to portico Shipping (an UK account) I was asking my wife to use her personal account to pay for it when it finally went trough. I know I am not important as my turnover is really a 1/10 of a drop in the Ocean of they're transactions, but I am OUT! .\n- Just in case you don't believe me.\nRVDN transport Virgil", 'review_date': '2022-08-05', 'review_time': '22:35:37', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
