I was also informed that Wise were not prepared to take any action to help put the error by them right, despite them releasing the wrong amount to (a Greek bank).\nOf course the Greek bank rejected the money as it was (7 cents to little).\nI then received a refund in very quick time of the rejected amount (very efficient of Wise).\nI will willingly use Wise again as they are normally top notch and well priced however I suggest some system enhancement is required to check transactions match to the requested amount before the money is released', 'review_date': '2022-06-16', 'review_time': '08:46:05', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nJun 16, 2022\nHi Frank,\n\nAppreciate your honest feedback!
