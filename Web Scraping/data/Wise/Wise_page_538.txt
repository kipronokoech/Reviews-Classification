They say check your account. They send me a phone number in the UK which I used after nobody is willing to help me. I called this number only to hear they can't help me. I ordered my South African bank to look and trace the money. They traced it but said it never arrived in South Africa. Wise told me they come back to me in 2 working days. Now it's 8 working days and still no money there. I used Wise a lot in the past but if the transfer does not work one is lost because Wise doesn't help their customers to find the money.
