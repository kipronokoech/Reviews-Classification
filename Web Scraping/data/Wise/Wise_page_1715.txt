However, last week in sending a transfer the transfer was stopped and I was required to submit documentation to re-verify my account. No problem. I quickly submitted the requested documents and was in contact with a customer service agent, Axa, to confirm the details. Axa advised she would personally put through the verification right away and to expect my transfer to proceed in 2 days, clearly this is not true. It has now been 9 days, I have emailed and called Wise each day to inquire. Emails have gone unresponded to. Phone calls I am given a run around that there were issues with the documents to the verification team is delayed. My documents were confirmed as satisfactory by Axa in email 9 days ago. Why the problem and delay in verification. Why is Wise.com not responding to email inquiries. Why is the agent answering the phone unable to provide assistance?', 'review_date': '2022-05-20', 'review_time': '12:26:50', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
