However, my recent experience has left me with significant concerns.\n\nIn my most recent transfer of $100, I encountered unexpected issues. The transfer was paused, and my money was held simply because I had mentioned a pet's name as a reference for my records. While Wise.com requested an explanation, I found it extremely frustrating that neither the app nor the website seemed to provide a clear and straightforward method for addressing this issue.\n\nFurthermore, when I attempted to contact support, I discovered that only email support was available, which resulted in slow communication. Responses often came a day later, making it difficult to resolve the problem promptly. What added to my frustration was that Wise.com seemed quick to place the blame on me, insisting that I had not provided the necessary information.\n\nDespite multiple requests, I found it nearly impossible to have the transfer canceled altogether. It feels as though my funds were held hostage without much consideration, and the delay in returning the funds added to the inconvenience.\n\nIn conclusion, I would caution anyone considering using Wise.com for their financial transactions, especially for day-to-day needs. While it had been a dependable service in the past, recent experiences suggest a decline in the quality of service and a lack of understanding towards customer issues. Proceed with caution and be prepared for potential delays and difficulties when dealing with Wise.com.", 'review_date': '2023-10-27', 'review_time': '08:05:04', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
