I go and try open a business account and it says that I am unable to open a business WISE account due to high demand, and I should enter a wait list.\n\nGoodbye once and for all, I am waiting my last payments from my business to transfer everything to Revolut and I am done with WISE FOREVER!\n\nI regret telling my friends and family to use WISE back then, I will go and ask them all to stop using WISE and I will go and make a reddit post about this.\n\nI have at least 15 different things that I am paying every month with my WISE credit card to run my business and all that is frozen now due to limit, and I cannot open a business account.\n\nAlso I transferred everything I had in WISE to my other account but it\'s still pending, 6500 euros hostage, after so many hours.

OK, all documents they asked were provided same day. They took 10 business days to finally look into them to tell that documents are declined!\n\nI\'ve submitted new documents that they asked. Now they are taking another 10 business days to review them! Keep in mind - no funds be accessed during all this period. I can\'t stress enough the problem it causes for the business overall. 40k EUR+ just being stuck nowhere.\n\nBut it gets better. Customer support is something else. Whenever you call, firstly you wait around 30 minutes for someone to pickup. And once they do pickup, they have ZERO will to help you and just dodge every single question with "We cannot help you with this matter". Just a slap into your face. Or they will put you on hold again for 30 minutes.\n\nI\'ve been a fan of Wise for very long years, introduced loads of people to their service. But such treatment is embarrassing.\n\nI\'m closing all accounts and filing a complaint.
