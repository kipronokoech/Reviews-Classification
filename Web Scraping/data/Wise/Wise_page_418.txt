I'm just about to move all my withdrawals there.\n\nHowever I can't just walk by the omissions they've made:\n1. In Australia only business accounts can use instantaneous Osko transfers. No reason was given.\n2. No joint accounts. This necessitated us opening other accounts. Again no timeline, not that hard to do.\n3. Direct Debits aren't support in New Zealand.\n4. There is no interest on AUD amounts.\n5. 1.5% extra payment for high balances on business acounts...\n\n2,3 and 5 necessitated me creating 2 different bank accounts. Increasing financial management time and pain by a significant amount.\n\nI know the review is quite low and all in all it is not that bad, but I had a few bad experiences with support as well.
