So i'm not sure why that happened but the funds are ready to go in but for some reason Wise did not allow the funds to be deposited.

My only improvement would be for more countries to be added, but other than that, this is a good company to use if you are wanting to make international transfers with very low fees, thank you! :)", 'review_date': '2023-03-15', 'review_time': '22:54:52', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
