When u go to send money international you have to give an IBAN, address, etc. That\'s fine, but the last thing I inputted was the recipient\'s email. After that it remove all the other fields and were no longer needed. Fine I wasted a little time not doing that first. There was no indication that would happen. After sending the money it didn\'t go to their bank it went into their Wise account. There was no indication of that either.\n\nThe app needs to updated. Have the top section ask for email and have a disclaimer saying give email to send to Wise account. Then a page Division saying "or". Then another disclaimer saying send directly to bank by inputting details below.\n\nThat would be a much better layout with appropriate disclaimers.\n\nStill better than Remitly\'s service though so 2 stars and not 1.', 'review_date': '2022-09-13', 'review_time': '17:42:09', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nSep 14, 2022\nHi Matthew,\n\nWe appreciate you taking the time and giving us feedback.
