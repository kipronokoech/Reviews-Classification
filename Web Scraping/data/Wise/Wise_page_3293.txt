I have bank accounts in both countries, but I opted for Wise thinking I would be able to transfer money faster and cheaper than through the banks own service. So far I've been wrong in relation to the former (not fast) and I'm yet to see if I had been wrong also in relation to the later (not cheap).\nSeveral days after starting the process I have been asked to provide copies of ID (passport), proof of income (contract or similar), statements from my local bank account from the past 3 months, a detailed explanation of the purpose of the transfer and the source of the money and have been asked to sign a statement declaring I am complying with local and international financial regulations and that I will comply with local taxes at the receiving end (as if I was not already legally bound to...). I wish they had informed this requirements upfront. I feel the first four days after ordering the transfer have been lost (and guess what: the exchange rate is better now!).\n\nIt's been a week already and no transfer has been received at my bank in Chile (transfers between local banks in Chile are free and processed instantly, even in non-business hours, regardless of the amount).\n\nWise charged a 3% fee for this service (smaller amounts incur larger fees).\n\nIf I had gone the bank to bank route, I would have had to pay a US$ 19 fee to the Swiss bank plus a 1% fee to the Chilean bank plus the hidden 4% fee they charge by means of lower than market average exchange rate. I still hope the 2% difference in favour of the service provided by Wise will prove worth the wait. The changing exchange rate has already eaten up half that difference...", 'review_date': '2021-04-30', 'review_time': '08:13:05', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nMay 7, 2021\nHello, Ricardo.\n\nIt's never our intention to cause any hassle or delays, but as a regulated financial institution, verification is a very important step for us.
