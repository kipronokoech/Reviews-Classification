And I must share the same frustration. They have been holding onto our life savings for nearly 5 days now. They keep saying the money wasn\'t transfered from my account and need to provide proof. I have sent screen grabs and I also asked the bank to provide a receipt, signed and timestamped which apparently is still not acceptable.\n\nThey claim to have passed this over to their "bank partner" now to confirm and will update me via email.\n\nI have just been informed via the chat the reason they have such strict security rules for SEK transfers is that sender\'s name and account details not visible when they receive a payment (how can that be!)\n\nThis has now been with their "bank partner" for 2 days tomorrow. Seriously how long does it take to call your bank partner (in this case Citibank Europe) ask them to trace the transaction, take a screen grab and show proof it left my account Swedish bank account and entered their own Swedish bank account!\n\nI have used HIFX (now XE.com) for many years with no complications until a friend of mine recently mentioned good things about this company and how they have one of the best exchange rates in the industry. This maybe the case, but we are 5 days into this now and we still haven\'t got anywhere.\n\nNow that my wife has seen these negative reviews which we now share similar circumstances, she is starting to have panic attacks worried we\'ll loose our life savings.\n\nWould be nice to get some verbal reasurrance and because of the large transaction amount some level of preference!', 'review_date': '2021-01-28', 'review_time': '19:44:23', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nFeb 4, 2021\nHello, Justin.\n\nThanks for sharing your feedback with us.\n\nWe can assure you keeping your money safe is our priority and your payment is never just gone or lost. When making a payment from your TransferWise account, the money should come from a bank account that's also under your name. When there isn't a clear match, we'll ask proof of payment to clarify the money came from your account.\n\nWe aim to complete this process as fast as possible, but even if it takes longer than expected initially, rest assured we're working on it.\n\nYou haven't shared the transfer details or your email with us here, so I'm unable to take a closer look, but feel free to reach us again at https://wi.se/contactus_.\n\nAll the best,\nJackie at TransferWise.", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2021-02-04', 'CompanyReplyTime': '12:23:51'}
