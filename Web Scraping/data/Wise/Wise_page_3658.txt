It's good to make comparisons. Be sure when comparing that you are getting what you pay for and a fair rate. Other competitors seem good but require paid memberships, better fees under certain, limited circumstances, and have hidden fees.\n\nWe pride ourselves on our fair rates and transparency. We'll work hard to improve the fees and we'll always announce any fee updates, so keep an eye out.\n\nBest Regards,\nThe TransferWise Team", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2020-12-21', 'CompanyReplyTime': '19:57:49'}

Great example...the point at which you know what you're rate will be you have already initiated a transfer. Doesnt mean the money has gone but TransferWise considers it a formal request. You can cancel this but you get a stern note back from TransferWise saying that you really need to limit the number of times you do this because it costs them money. This is just plain dumb. There should be a safe way of seeing what your rate and resulting transfer amount will be before you are essentially further down the path.", 'review_date': '2020-12-21', 'review_time': '15:54:49', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nDec 22, 2020\nHello there.\n\nAs you finish setting up your transfer, we'll guarantee your rate for a certain period of time. It's important that you send your money to us right away so we receive your money on time. As long as we receive your money on time, you’ll get that rate locked.\n\nIf your money doesn't reach us in time, we'll still convert and send it as soon as possible.
