Wise simply assert that this was an iOS transaction from said Credit Card. Categorically - this was NOT the case. I'm not even sure I would know how to do this! I instructed the funds transfer on my PC. There is NO relationship between my Wise Account and any Credit Card. The only options online were to transfer from my Wise Account to any one of two GBP Clearing Banks. Wise have apparently infringed my data by having access to an unassociated Credit Card on an unassociated device. This is a great cause for concern. The fact that they are unable to explain how this has happened is of even greater concern.\n\nADDENDUM:\nIt is understood that your reply is aimed at your wider audience, with a view to protecting your public image. However - you fail to acknowledge the relevant facts. I categorically DID NOT instruct cash transfer from a Credit Card through my Wise Account to my GBP Clearing Bank. Why would I? How would I? The issue very clearly lies within the Wise system which, worryingly, applied instruction against an unlinked Credit Card through the Apple Pay system.
