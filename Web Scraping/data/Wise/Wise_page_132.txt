While we work on your payment, you can always see an estimate of how long it’ll take for us to complete your transfer. Do keep in mind this estimate can change depending on a few factors, such as the currencies you’re sending, when and how you are paying us. If we need more time to work on your payment, we'll update the estimate as well.\n\nYou can learn more about that here: https://wi.se/howlongdotransferstake\n\nRegarding the 2-step verification code, we always ask for that in order to protect your account. In case you're facing issues with that, you can check this link: https://wi.se/2fanotworking\n\nOur team can gladly take a closer look into your account if you get in touch with us through here: https://wi.se/contactus or via our social media support channels.\n\nWise", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2023-08-17', 'CompanyReplyTime': '09:18:31'}
