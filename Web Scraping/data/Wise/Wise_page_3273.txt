Wise clearly state the actual fee up front:\n\nYou can't figure out from your credit card statement what your real costs are when dealing with any bank. The banks don't declare the extra margins they add to everything (exchange rate margin)... so you've got no idea how much a transaction is really costing you. The regulators (ACCC & ASIC) are asleep at the wheel. ACCC was busy prosecuting the Palace Cinemas for failing to declare $1.30 charges on movie tickets until they got to the last page... but let banks walk away with billions in profits (no declaration of exchange rate profiteering anywhere) without lifting a finger.\n\nIf the government wants a good example of how transparent a financial business can be they ought to look at Wise.
