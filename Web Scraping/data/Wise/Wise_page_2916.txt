{'platform': 'Wise', 'id': '6117dad151602952de93bf49', 'stars': 1, 'title': 'Customer service is ATROCIOUS', 'message': 'I\'d love to give them a good rating, since many people recommended me, but I cannot.\n\nI had a relatively new account but the very first time I needed support, it was just terrible. I spoke to someone with a nasty attitude, who kept fighting me throughout the chat, who didn\'t give me any instructions or explanations, and instead kept telling me "I told you this" to the point that I had to copy and paste my initial question -- which the person never answered. Then I was offered a solution that I didn\'t want, but never a valid explanation as to why my transaction wasn\'t going through. I said I would cancel my account, the person did nothing, Wise shut it down immediately and never followed through.\n\nIf Wise doesn\'t want my money, I\'m sure someone else does.\n\nBy the way, I was slapped a 2% fee (yes, TWO PERCENT FEE, almost PayPal stuff) for transferring money in and out of Wise. So, their promise of "fairness" in exchange rates falls short of their business acumen.\n\nFinally, good luck finding a positive review here on Trustpilot that has not been made by invitation of Wise itself.\n\n-----\nEDIT - In response to Wise\'s feedback below:\n\nThank you for you response, but I must add this: regarding your statement that "... customer support doesn\'t have the ability to speed up or process payments from their side," WHERE in my review do I say that I was trying to hasten a payment? I was getting an error message while trying to make a transfer as if the numbers I was inputting were wrong, but they were EXACTLY the same I had used before for wire transfers. I didn\'t even type them, just copied/pasted from a successful transaction.\n\nI reached out to customer service to see what was going on, why the ABA/routing numbers were not being accepted. It could even be a problem with my US bank and not Wise. Fine, things sometimes just don\'t work. But the real issue here is: I chatted with a HORRIBLY INCOMPETENT agent who, to make matters worse, had a DISRESPECTFUL attitude and did not answer my questions, who kept sending me a link with explanations that I had already read and did not explain the issue at hand -- which was why a transfer to US wasn\'t working -- and instead told me that I could simply transfer to my European account with IBAN, which was NOT a solution for my problem. I am about to close that account and move out of the country and was counting on Wise to have a working debit card (which I had already paid for), so transferring funds to Europe was not a solution for my problem. I needed a transfer to the US and he couldn\'t help me with that, all the while giving me snarky answers and saying "I already told you that".\n\nIt is quite clear that you have a SERIOUS management problem, whereby customer assistance is given by unable people while there is no middle management to take over, much less see what your agents are doing and saying. Just check all the 1-star reviews here and you\'ll notice that most complaints involve half-baked customer service, poor communications, and problems that need a better management to take care of.\n\nInstead, you pass the hat on happy customers to provide feedback here, whereas spontaneous positive feedback is nowhere to be found.\n\nI could potentially give you folks another shot, but needed to see if anyone there really cares about customer service, and not only about making pubic excuses (like posting this response here, which by the way had nothing to do with my review and complaint.) I could potentially think that it was just a bad hair day for everybody and that things could go smoothly next time, but the other 1-star reviews, far from being just grumpy people complaining of transfer delays, are mostly from people HORRIBLY DECEIVED with the poor customer service they were given, that no valid response was offered, that no solution was offered, that customer service didn\'t help at all, and so on.\n\nWhat do you have to offer to me that would warrant my giving you a second chance?\n\nTry doing like my US credit card company, which charges me no international transaction fees and whose exchange rates are very reasonable. Wise instead charged me 2% fees.\n\nTry doing like my US bank, which allows me to withdraw money at mid-market rates and charging 1% fee -- half of what you charged me.\n\nGive me some reassurance that, upon needing customer service, I will be offered a knowledgeable and respectful person to look into my business. Here again my US credit card has a STELLAR record, based on not one but many times I reached out to them, including a nasty dispute with an airline.\n\nIf you can offer me any indication that this could be a reality, I\'d be more than happy to give Wise another shot.', 'review_date': '2021-08-25', 'review_time': '08:56:53', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nAug 25, 2021\nHello, Marc.\n\nSorry you didn't have the best experience with us.\n\nWe aim to offer you the best service possible, but do keep in mind customer support doesn't have the ability to speed up or process payments from their side.
