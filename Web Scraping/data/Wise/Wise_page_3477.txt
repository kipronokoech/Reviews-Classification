The reason for using TransferWise in this case was to save money - if I were to send the funds directly, my bank would charge me Â£20 to make the transfer, so TransferWise is a lot cheaper.\nB) For sending money from the same sterling account to my account in Zambia, which is denominated in Zambian Kwacha. The reason for using TransferWise in this case is because I have experienced problems in sending the funds directly. On two occasions, the money was not transferred but instead returned weeks later, although I was still charged; and neither the sending bank nor the receiving bank would accept responsibility for the failure.\n\nNow to my comments.\n1) In general, the system works as advertised. However, I do feel that it could be made more streamlined from the user's point of view. I appreciate the need to specify the bank, type of account and method of sending the funds to TransferWise on the first occasion. But surely it shouldn't be necessary to go through this rigmarole every time one wants to send funds? An option to use the same parameters for subsequent transactions would be most welcome.\n2) When sending money to Zambia, for some reason the funds are first converted to euros. I don't see the need for this, as it means I am on the wrong end of two currency conversions: firstly from pounds to euros and secondly from euros to Kwacha.\n3) Recently I inadvertently sent the wrong amount of money to Transferwise. The only response from TransferWise was that the funds had still to be received. I was sure I'd sent the money, so it was only when I eventually inspected my record of the transfer that I discovered my error. A message that only part of the money had been received would have been useful. This experience also leads me to wonder what would have happened if I'd inadvertently sent too much money.", 'review_date': '2021-02-03', 'review_time': '17:24:30', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nFeb 12, 2021\nHey, Steve.\n\nThanks for sharing your experience with us.\n\nWe would like to clarify that when you set up a transfer order on your TransferWise account, we need to receive the exact amount for which the order was set up for. If you send us more, the excess amount will be sent back to you right away. If you send less, we'll notify you via email and we'll send you an email with instructions on how to pay for the remaining amount. However, we have a window to send you this email, and it could be you have realized your have sent less more before we have processed your first payment and could notify, as we can see both payments were received on the same day, very close to each other. So you didn't receive any communication from us, because we ended up receiving the full amount within this window.\n\nAs for Zambian kwacha, we do support this currency and no extra conversion is needed. You just need to make sure you choose ZMW on the second box of the calculator.\n\nAs for the recipient details, we have the option to add a recipient and also repeat a transfer, but we'll always ask you to double check the details and confirm them before sending the money. This is just to be extra safe and make sure you're sending the money to correct account details.\n\nAll the best,\nTransferWise", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2021-02-12', 'CompanyReplyTime': '13:07:00'}
