I provided all the necessary documents that are proving my income source.\n\nNow, I just received an automated reply to my appeal that your Team decided to close my account. I discovered that my account had been closed despite my efforts to continually provide all the required information for your Team. I am shocked and disappointed that my account has been closed without explanation. I have been relying on my Wise account as a payment method to receive and transfer money. I have held this account for many years, always maintained a healthy balance, and never received a single complaint against me.\n\nI am eager to discuss this matter further and would appreciate an opportunity to do so.
