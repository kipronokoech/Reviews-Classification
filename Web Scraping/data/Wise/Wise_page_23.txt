Then is was a 100% useless.\n\nI’m several weeks into trying to move money between two business accounts (which had been working fine for months) and all we get is repeated requests for more and more documents which takes more and more time. Support is useless, just a giant time suck. You cannot speak to anyone - ever. They have web chats - that you can find if you can navigate the infuriating help system - allows you to “chat” with someone who is obviously dealing with other people so you sit and wait and wait and wait.\n\nIn the intervening time we opened another bank account instead. Save yourself the hassle and do that up front - wise just isn’t worth the bother for a business.\n\nPS - and if only Wise responded to issues customers are having in real time at the same speed that they respond to a public facing poor review. What you say you do and what you actually do is quite different - days of non response, literally hours of sitting on hold on the phone and NEVER picked up, not once. Massively disrespectful.\n\nAsking for docs for verification is fine - asking dumb questions again and again after they’ve been answered is not, with days intervening that still leave you unable to access funds - and all it would have taken is a two minute conversation, which you can’t have because nobody will ever speak to you. Greatest advice I got in business was “pick up the f$&@ing phone” - you get more customers, and they’ll do more business with you.\n\nFine for one off transfers, not fine for business - too hard, too unreliable.

We have strict guidelines placed on us in each region we operate in, and we take this extremely seriously.\n\nDeactivating accounts isn't something we take lightly. It's often a result of a conflict with our Terms of Service or Customer Agreement, or due to a discrepancy with a financial law. We can't always share the exact reason for the deactivation, due to how we're regulated.
