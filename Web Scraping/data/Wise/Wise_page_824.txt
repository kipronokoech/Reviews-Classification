Lucky enough someone told me about Wise when it was still TransferWise and I havenâ€™t looked back since. Got no complaints yet. Very handy and itâ€™s slowly becoming my main account. I travel a fair bit and thereâ€™s no better way to move and spend money when abroad.

When you send a transfer via SWIFT, it goes through an international payment network, which means that the receiving end might receive less, because of the banks that handle the money along the way. We donâ€™t have control over when these fees are charged, or how much they cost. In addition, your recipientâ€™s bank may charge fees to receive payments sent with SWIFT.\n\nMore info here: https://wi.se/euroutsideofsepa_\n\nThe cost of your transfer from our side depends on several factors: the currencies you use, the payment method you choose, and the current market exchange rate. We explain in more detail how our commissions work here: https://wi.se/ourfees_\n\nIf you want to calculate our fees for your transfer to get the cost, you can use our virtual calculator: https://wi.se/pricecalculator_\n\nOur mission is to make money transfers free of cost, but we haven't reached this goal just yet. Until then, we'll always disclose our fees before you pay for your transfer, and we keep our pricing as transparent (and low) as possible.\n\nWise", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2022-11-03', 'CompanyReplyTime': '08:45:38'}
