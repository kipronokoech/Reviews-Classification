I was exploring while making first transaction on wise.com; opted option which was showing money transfer in seconds (instead of 2 days); while entering Debit card, charges got changed from 28 to 48$ with message that I am using business Debit card and 28 is for personal Debit card; system looked dynamic; anyway, I completed the transaction; money got withdrawn from my account the moment I pressed the complete button. Then I got status update that it would take 3 days as verification is needed; and since it's weekend, I need to wait because there is no support during weekend. Finally on Monday I got email; I replied to the email with asked information; after couple of hours called customer service for Canada (in Florida, USA) which start from 10 am; I came to know that verification can take 1- 2 days further; first rep suggested that we have team is in Europe and it's kind of end of the day; second rep suggested we are extremely busy and there is no timeline; verification might take 2 - 3 days.\nI would say support system is broken for North American clients; as it main support/verification dept are in Europe. Won't recommend because if you need active support for any reason regarding your transaction, it should not be your choice. If you can be happy with email support, once per day email communication (but by the time you reply it could be end of day in Europe working hours, so have no choice but to wait for next working day in Europe).
