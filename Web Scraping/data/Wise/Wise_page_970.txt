Usually, when such things happen, the money that got debited twice is in pending status, and should release automatically within 17 days. But, to quicken the process, you should reach out to the merchant - the money is with them, and only they can release it before/make a refund. We understand, that that's not an ideal situation, but that's the fastest way to get your money back.\n\nMost likely, our team is already investigating this matter, and as soon as there's any news, they'll email you. But you can always give us a quick call: https://wi.se/contactus_ so we could give you a status update.\n\nWise team.", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2022-10-06', 'CompanyReplyTime': '08:32:13'}
