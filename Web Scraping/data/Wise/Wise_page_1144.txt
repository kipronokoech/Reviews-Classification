Often there was an error in the form and my wire would just sit in limbo finally cancelled after several days.\nNow I can just send an ACH to the Wise US bank. Then, use my preset information to send it by money wire to my Japan Rakuten bank account.\nThis time TD America Trade - > ACH -> Wise -> Money Wire -> (15min) Rakuten Bank Japan took about 2 days total and was much cheaper and totally hassle free.\nThanks so much.\nBest regards,\nBill Roope', 'review_date': '2022-09-02', 'review_time': '13:43:11', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
