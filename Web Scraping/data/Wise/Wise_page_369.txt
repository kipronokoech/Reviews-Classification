They keep asking for additional documents and they are never ever satisfied. It\'s actually hilarious because I sent them literally more than they will ever need. I felt extremely discriminated against during this process. I am 100% sure that this process was made difficult by the company on purpose.\n\nI called their line a few times and most of their employees weren\'t able to speak English fluently, and they kept reading the same boring "information" from their screens. Only one employee tried to help me and even he couldn\'t resolve "my issue".\n\nThanks to this company I couldn\'t pay my rent and deposit on time and that made me look like a liar and a fraud. I have never been humiliated like this before.\nThey\'ve made my move to Germany a nightmare. And they\'re literally holding my money hostage for no legitimate reason.\n\nI want to remind you that if you don\'t remove my personal data from your servers as soon as possible, I will lodge a complaint with the competent supervisory authority. If I encounter a legal penalty because of your inability to provide your service, you can be sure that I will sue you for recourse for damages.\n\nStay away from this company if you care about your well being. Shame on Wise for making me go through all of this stress and frustration. I don\'t remember ever feeling so bad about a service I paid for.', 'review_date': '2023-04-27', 'review_time': '18:54:33', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

I would have given it a 5 star rating, but the platform doesn\'t offer enough currency converter options (or a Wise card) for African nations such as Ghana. I would have loved to use the "Jar" feature to convert USD to GH Cedis and have stored up "travel" funds on hand when its time to make a trip over. With the enormous population of Africa, one would think more countries on the continent would have been available. I guess there isn\'t enough forward thinking executives on staff at Wise to read the tea leaves yet.
