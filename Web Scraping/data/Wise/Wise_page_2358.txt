I've not had a problem with the first few transactions. Then suddenly I had a verification check after trying to send money. They wanted to see sensitive documents that could be used fraudulently (I dont know who's reciving them?!) and their call centre is abroad.. it screamed identity theft. So I thought nah, just cancel the tranfser.. but they refused! wouldnt refund the money, wouldnt send it on, they were keeping it indefinitely until I gave them my I.D. They held my money hostage until I gave them the I.D.\n\nDon't believe the fake reviews here, they seem to be swamping trustpilot with good reviews to hide the bad.
