For example, the USD account can only receive funds from a small group or "certain countries". 3. If you registered a company in their jurisdiction for a Business account (UK), they still go by where you live as a person, which defeats the whole concept of company registration. Beware of Company registration sites that promote this service as a "solution" if you register your company in the UK with them. Transferwire still drills you about where you live as a person. According to Stripe (payment processors), the US account might be subject to US taxes. When we tried to link it to them, Stripe asked for a W8 (US Tax payment form). Even if we don´t live in the US, and the company is not US registered. They need to get their act together or be straight up with the public about what is it that they really offer. If you are into Global e commerce, it won´t work for everybody. And Transferwire should not accept your registration fee knowing that the country you live in is not on their list.
