I probably didnâ€™t even come close to $500 worth of transactions. I got the Wise card for my trip to Ukraine. I made one purchase with the card for $14 and transferred money to a friend for her paying for a hotel and some food. I have all documents to verify my trip. However, it is impossible to talk to anyone in customer service. You cannot depend on this company if you are making a trip. I hope that anyone who reads this review takes my word. I am an attorney and a doctor. Every transaction has been for legitimate transactions and well within any customer agreement. PLEASE CAREFULLY REVIEW ALL OF THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS!!!! They will steal your money without any reason! They may respond to some people\'s reviews saying they cannot share why they deactivate accounts because of the way they are regulated. Please do not fall for this crap. I know how they are regulated!!!!! I know that I did not do a single thing wrong. For them to say they cannot tell someone why they deactivated their account is just a flat out lie. As I said before, I am an attorney, so please, by all means, have someone from your legal department (if you have one) to contact me and explain the legalities behind this. I am seriously looking into filing a class action suit against them. If Trust Pilot will allow me to share my contact information, I will be happy to do that, but companies like this should not be allowed to take advantage of people and then say "We cannot tell you why we do what we do due to the way we are regulated (or some other bull crap wording that is just a flat out lie". So for the love of God, Wise, please do not waste your time responding to my review with lies. Just contact me and give me the true legal breakdown of why you do what you do. If I am satisfied, I will change my review. The very fact that my review will remain on here will show exactly how fraudulent your company is.\n***Update***\nI received an email that said "we need more information from you before we reopen your account". When I click on the link, it says that my account has been deactivated. I have still not been able to contact customer service. No one should have to go through this much trouble when completing legitimate legal transactions.', 'review_date': '2021-08-11', 'review_time': '14:51:51', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
