After delaying two outgoing payments from 16th July (both UK to UK transactions) they kept kicking the can down the road with the usual messages about regulatory checks and 'it's for your own safety' they eventually decided they couldn't complete the payments and refunded the money (around ¬£11k) to my account. Great, I thought, we finally have resolution! Unfortunately 15 minutes later I received an email to say all of my accounts had be deactivated. The amazing thing is that at no point did anyone from Wise ask for any supporting documents or information about the payments (I had everything to hand to justify them)...they just closed the accounts and said if you want your money back then you can appeal for it and someone will get back to you in 10 days to let you know if you can have it! I have made the appeal and was dismayed to find that even though I hold GBP, Euro and USD balances, I can only be paid back in one of those currencies...so will end up losing money once they return the funds.\n\nI've been a Wise customer for nearly 5 years and generally I've been very impressed by the service and recommended them to numerous friends and colleagues. But, after this experience, I have to warn everyone to tread carefully with them. I wouldn't trust them any longer.\n\nSo if anyone from Wise is reading this then please note that you have managed to change a 5 star review into a 1 star review without too much effort. And you've lost a customer who has transacted more than ¬£1m through your service over the years without a care.", 'review_date': '2021-08-12', 'review_time': '17:12:17', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nAug 23, 2021\nHello there,\n\nDeactivation can happen for a few reasons, but because of the way we're regulated, we can't share with you the exact reason why.
