This is possible and we can accept US dollars from outside USA, but bear in mind that in this case- your bank would use SWIFT network to send us the funds. This means that your money will move through the network of banks, who all have their own charges. More at:https://transferwise.com/help/articles/2553074.\n\nKeep in mind that while we do offer the guaranteed rate, there are specific timeframes where we need to receive the funds from you in order to lock it for you. SWIFT transfers can usually take longer to reach us, which means that we might have to apply new mid market rate of the time we receive your funds. We'll always confirm it with you first, though. More about guaranteed rate here:https://transferwise.com/help/articles/2448203.\n\nIf you have further questions, don't hesitate to reach out at:https://transferwise.com/help/contact and we'll help.\n\nBest wishes,\nTransferWise Team.", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2020-11-04', 'CompanyReplyTime': '11:30:14'}
