We understand that it can be confusing, but we are, in fact, transparent with our fees.

We don‚Äôt have control over when these fees are charged, or how much they cost. More here: https://wi.se/swiftpayments_ We'll also show you a message before you send us any money - you can always choose yourself if you're comfortable with this fee.\n\nHope this clarified a bit more, but you can always contact us at https://wi.se/contactus_ or on our social media channels if you've more questions on this transfer. - Wise.", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2022-11-10', 'CompanyReplyTime': '01:55:47'}

I wish I‚Äôd done my research before using them to transfer money. The money was very quickly out of my account, but they are taking a long time to process and send over to my girlfriend in Canada who really needed the money for food. They have no customer service, the customer service you do get lacks empathy and just links back to resources that say that they can basically take as long as they please to send your money. The delay makes literally no sense, which makes me think they probably gamble the money for a couple of days and hope for the best and that‚Äôs how they make a profit. If I don‚Äôt get something within the next day or so I‚Äôll be forwarding this company and all the comments I‚Äôve seen to my uncle to see about a lawsuit for mishandling of peoples funds.
