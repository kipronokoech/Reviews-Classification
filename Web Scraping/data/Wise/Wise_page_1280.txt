But after that, we’ll charge you 0.50 GBP/EUR per transaction. This is a fixed fee. If you take out over 200 GBP/EUR in one month, we’ll charge you 1.75% on top of that.\n\nWe always charge as little as possible, and our mission is to eventually be completely free of charge. We haven't reached these goals just yet, but we're working hard to achieve this.
