I also have a company account with Wise.\nThe fees are low and the transfers were always successful so far.\nOnce a year it seems that one has to provide certain information about the\ncompany. I sent this information 4 weeks ago for the first time, then reminder emails arrived, even though I had already sent the information. But a confirmation of me having sent the information I did not get and it has not been reviewed yet. So I keep on getting these reminder emails. This is the only thing why I did not give 5 stars. I contacted Wise via Chat about that. I hope this issue will be sorted out. I did not see a telephone number to contact Wise, but the chat was ok.', 'review_date': '2021-12-06', 'review_time': '09:57:10', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
