It sounds like your transfer might be going through checks. While our goal is to complete all payments as fast as we can, weâ€™re a regulated financial institution and as such, we need to carry extra checks on transfers from time to time. This is a routine procedure to help us ensure weâ€™re keeping our platform safe for everyone using (including you) while complying with local regulations.\n\nSpeed is always our priority, but so is diligence. Depending on the case, it can take from hours to several days. Do keep in mind, we always make sure to update you along the way, and youâ€™ll know the status of your transfer at all times.\n\nIf you need help with a specific transfer, you can always contact us here: https://wi.se/contactus_ or Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram with your email and user number. We will gladly review and provide you with the necessary assistance.\n\nWise.", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2022-12-07', 'CompanyReplyTime': '12:51:07'}
