Feature wise its one of the useful services out there and it still is. However I feel like they are starting to act like one of the "big banks" and do more what they want and not what we want. They are now investing our money like banks do, but we dont get interests. Yet they keep increasing fees, but nothing has improved. They seems to be looking into becoming a broker and I dont know if that will help with lowering the core fees.\n\nWorst of all is the deterioration of customer service. When you send a question in, they reply with a generic response. The response usually has nothing to do with my question, its almost like one of those bots responding. Its very clear that no human reads your email until you reply 3 or 4 times and show some frustration. I dont know if they are using an AI or outsourced people, but that kind of support doesnt help with your confidence in them handling your money.\n\nIts very sad to see one of my favorite service becoming so bad.', 'review_date': '2022-11-08', 'review_time': '13:35:19', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nNov 9, 2022\nHello!\n\nThanks for taking the time to share this feedback.
