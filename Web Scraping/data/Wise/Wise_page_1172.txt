I recently transferred a large sum of money via Wise from my UK bank. Then it all went wrong. I had to cancel the transfer and requested Wise to refund the money back to my bank account. They said they had done it within g a day. However 15 days later I still haven't seen my money back. My bank has attempted to trace this money that they believe sits in an intermediary bank where my actual banks details hadn't been provided by Wise. So the money sits in no mans land. Trying to communicate with Wise is something not to be desired. They are hopeless and incompetent, or simply don't care.\nThey are rude and untrustworthy and can't be recommended by me. Stay away from Wise. They may on the surface ofer good exchange rates quick and efficient, but when things don't go to plan you're in trouble..they don't care.\nThankfully my bank has worked hard to trace and hopefully recover the funds.\nStay away from Wise there are plenty of others to choose from.", 'review_date': '2022-08-27', 'review_time': '18:21:56', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
