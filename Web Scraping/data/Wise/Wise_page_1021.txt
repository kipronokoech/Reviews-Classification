We take safety and security seriously, and we follow a strict set of laws in every country we operate in. The time of a transfer depends on several factors such as the payment method, the amount, additional reviews by banks, among others. However, we'll always try to send the money as quickly as possible. You can always contact us at https://wi.se/contactus_ or on our social media channels, and we'll gladly look into your case.\n\n- Wise", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2022-09-28', 'CompanyReplyTime': '02:14:16'}
