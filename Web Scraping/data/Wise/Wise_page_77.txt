It only became clear after the money weas sent that on their live chat platform (which no long exists) that asked if the money had been sent, then they went quiet.\n\nI tried multiple time to make contact sending emails to their published email address, but that bounced back, tried their phone number, but now was unobtainable, so I contacted to Police and they advise to contact to payment bank, in this case, I search for their sort code 23-14-70 (Wise Payments Ltd 6Th Floor, The Tea Building 56, Shoreditch High Street London E1 6JJ) a/c 279063414 in the name of Paa Cabs Private Ltd and spoke to Dominic which the call was recoded for the Police. I explained everything that they were opening up accounts for scammers to operate and I asked what checks were made to ensure that the account holder(s) was genuine.\n\nThe account this company gave me was Paa Cabs Private Ltd. a few days later I pretended to be a different customer on their live chat platform when it came live again, and asked for their certain items and this time they gave me another account to transfer money too which I did of course, but this time, the sort code was 23-08-01 (Wise Payments Ltd 6Th Floor, The Tea Building 56, Shoreditch High Street\nLondon E1 6JJ) a/c 30126681 now in the name of Muhammad Abaid Ullah. The sort code came back as being owned by the same bank with the same address in London. I did not know that it was legal to have more than 1 sort code per bank at the same address. I have tried to call wise to speak to Dominic again, but without luck.\n\nThe did send me an email Wise in response to one that Dominic sent me on 18th Sept @ 13:24 stating "Our team will look into your claim and will get back to you as soon as possible" for more information, which I responded to immediately. I then sent a further email with more information about the second account from the same scam company using the second sort code but belong to the same Wise Bank at 6Th Floor, The Tea Building 56, Shoreditch High Street London E1 6JJ. So I was surprised one bank can have 2 sort codes! secondly, by are the harboring so many scammers without doing full and proper checks of their customers opening up accounts? and Thirdly, I am still waiting for their email response as the Police have asked me to wait to see what response is received from Wise Payments Ltd of London. So could you please identify my emails and respond why you are harboring Thieves, Scammers and Conmen on you banking platform? What checks are you completing to ensure that your customer that you take on are actually genuine clients? and not Scammers?', 'review_date': '2023-09-21', 'review_time': '18:04:05', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
