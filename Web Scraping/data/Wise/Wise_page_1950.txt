More than 1 year ago we opened a business account with them. We are based southern Europe and we trade only with European and UK entities. At the opening we provided all the information and documents requested and they were making problems mixing our business with someone else. They linked our company that is specialized in consultancy in computer technology with a yacht company based in UK. Then since January 2022 something changed and every month they block the account, multiple times a month. Provided any kind of information, IDs multiple times, usage of the account. Every month they block the account again and again and then they ask the same things over and over again. Now they want a "selfie", but their system keeps giving the "oops, something went wrong" message.\nLooking for a different service provider since Wise become completely unreliable.
