We are American citizens and live in Hungary. We ordered a new car here and needed to transfer funds from the US bank to the local dealership to pay for car. The HQ of our bank is located in Washington State in the US and this bank is not big one, not even having a SWIFT. Thus we were explained that we need to transfer funds by portions not exceeding $15K/day. After the first successful transfer which took literally a few seconds we tried to transfer another $15K on the next day. But we received message that there is not enough funds to complete a transfer. We checked our bank, the previous transaction was cleared and there were plenty of money for the next transfer. The dealership has already received the money as well. We contacted Wise to find out whatâ€™s going on. We were explained that it needs 4 business day to clear transaction. Our car will be ready on April 22 and we are not sure if it is enough time to complete full payment on time. The wire transfer option is not working for us as our bank does not have online option for International transaction to Wise. This is why we use an ACH option. Also this option helps us to watch for the best current rate.\nThis is our negative experience to transfer a large amount of money with a huge delay. Why it takes 4 business days to clear transaction?\nThe positive things are that the process of transactions are very smooth and fast. The fees for transaction and currency conversion are good too. When we transfer not large amount of money to the local bank it takes just seconds to see money in our bank account.\nIn general I would recommend all my friends to use Wise for transfer and conversion money.\nL.
