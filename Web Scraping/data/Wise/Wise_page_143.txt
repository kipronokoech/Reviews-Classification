They refused twice to verify or to explain why a document listed on their own KB as acceptable, is not acceptable to the support agents. After 3 different support tickets I finally found an agent who understood that the proof document is perfectly valid and verified my account.

{'platform': 'Wise', 'id': '64d02f4a64b770946edb1500', 'stars': 1, 'title': 'The Customer support and company…', 'message': 'The Customer support and company validation process is awful.\n\nI recently created a new company at Wise. I sent all the requested documentation, and my company was validated swiftly.\nAfter a few weeks, I received my first payment from Shopify, which Wise declined, and they asked for more proof about funding my company.\nBecause I had multiple entities at Wise (personal, and I am running two other companies), the requested documentation and communication flow was unclear.\nLike how can I send "transaction history" for a new company?\nI asked follow up questions, and I sent the the confirmation invoice from Shopify to explain the source of the income.\nAfter two weeks, my documentation was declined, and instead of explaining what they were looking for, they sent the same request. I called customer service, and they told me I have to provide my personal transaction history to prove I have money to found the company (we are speaking about 1000USD here)\nSo I sent them all the details again with my personal statements for the last 6 months. Two weeks passed again, and my request was declined again. They explained I have to send the proof about my other company because they see that my income comes from the source where I am the owner.\nSo I uploaded those sources, 6 months transaction history, proof from IRD (tax agency), proof from my accountant that I am running a clean business.\nTwo weeks passed again, and I received zero communication. I called up the call center. They promised they would follow up the matter and they will send me an email immediately. I never received any email, and or any follow up, and another 5 days passed.\n\nRight now, I am not able to pay anything from my newly formed company because wise decline every transaction.\nI do not get any "wise" people on the phone, everyone is just doing "forwarding" and "escalating," but nothing is really happening.\n\nTransferwise was great, but Wise is awfully dumb. I started a process with another provider to create an account and move all of accounting there. It will be a hard process, but I can not stand this level of support\n---\nReflecting Wise Answer in this thread:\n- They took zero responsibility for the delay.\n- They tried to pose the process is "hard and painful" because of "other" factors, and not them.\n- They highlighted the rebranding process again\nWhat they did not do:\n- Provide actual help\n- Provide any level of extra care beyond the basic templates and communication\n\nSimple term. The support team has zero visibility and access for cross functional team, so if you are in trouble, deal with it.\n\nMy recommendation (this is what am I doing):\n- Mitigate the issue. Wise has a great price advantage if it is working.\n- Have a second solution for banking, even if you are a small startup like me\n---\nMore update on 19/08/2023.
