I checked my Microsoft account billing section and saw a message ' no transactions for the past 3 months'.\n\nThis set off the alarm bells even more. It must be fraud but how?\n\nI have deleted the virtual card and created a new one but Wise support website states it can take 31 days to address any reported issues. They don't seem to have a 'Report Fraud' direct number as you would expected a regular bank to have.\n\nFeeling robbed and violated that some random thief has taken money from what I thought was a secure account is really not nice and not having the right support in place isn't comforting.\n\nWhat made it worse is, when I called Wise support and spoke to a lady there, I explained my trauma and she said, 'thank you, no problem, I'll look into it'!\n\nHOLD ON - NO PROBLEM!! There is a problem!\n\nUpdate:\n\nWise emailed me within an hour (maybe sooner) with an update explaining that the 5x identical charges made to my virtual credit card were not funds taken from my account by Microsoft and were not fraudulent and no funds taken from the account. The explained that they are â€˜reserved chargesâ€™ for a subscription on an old Xbox account. Still, it would be great if the account could show this type of charge as â€œâ€˜Reserved Chargeâ€™ as Microsoft had stated they had no record of charges made. Maybe this type of â€˜reserved chargeâ€™ could show more detail on the online statement. Well done to Wise for getting back to me so quickly, thank you.\n\nIâ€™m happy again now.", 'review_date': '2022-09-16', 'review_time': '06:17:07', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nSep 15, 2022\nHi Peter,\n\nWe appreciate you taking the time to give us feedback.
