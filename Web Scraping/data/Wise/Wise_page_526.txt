Claimed the TX was a scam when it's been routine for years. On top of that his employer here deposited his month's pay into his Wise account after it was suspended and now a whole months' income is frozen for 30 days. Meanwhile, his wife and 5 kids have run out of money and are begging and borrowing from friends and relatives to make ends meet. What a disaster. Wise are simply dogs when it comes to expediency.

A few weeks ago they requested a few documents and they wrote I have to upload it until 9th of January. I uploaded these weeks ago and they didn\'t request anything else. On 10th of January I tried to pay with my Wise card and the transaction was declined. I checked the Wise application and they requested an additional document (like a bank statement) and I uploaded this again. They wrote it will be verified in 1 day. I wrote them a message and I wrote why they didn\'t request this document in advance and why they restricted my account first and requested the document after this only. A few hours later I tried to check if my uploaded document was verified but they deactivated my account without any notification or explanation! I had money on my balance! On their website they wrote that in this case I have to send an appeal to get my money back. This company is a joke. They can do whatever they want with your account and with your money.\n\nI contacted them several times via email, no answer so far.\n\nIf you don\'t want to have any trouble with payments or financial things NEVER use this criminal company!\n\nUpdate 11.01.2023: Yes, Wise has a reason like the bank robber when he robs the bank. Scammer like Wise always use general false phrases as a "reason" because they don\'t have any real reason and correct explanation behind their actions.\nAs I already wrote I\'ve already contacted them and they haven\'t sent any answer.\nMoreover it is another interesting thing that I have to send an appeal to get my own money back.
