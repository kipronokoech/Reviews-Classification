The platform works on mobile devices and computers. All one needs is a reliable network connection and genuine bank accounts at each end of the transfer. The choice of products is good with Wise being able to operate as your local account in a chosen country for both payment and receipt of funds. Direct transfers, borderless accounts and the Wise debit card are the three most common ways to use the services. The rates are always competitive and become more so the more you transfer. There is also a business banking platform which allows great flexibility for those operating import export businesses. I have used the platform for more than 5 years and it has never let me down. There are other providers that offer certain special deals but for my purposes Wise has always been the superior choice. As always research and make your decision before committing.', 'review_date': '2022-04-05', 'review_time': '05:58:19', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
