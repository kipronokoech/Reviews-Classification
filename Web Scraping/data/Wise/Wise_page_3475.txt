However, we can't refund any fees that were charged by your bank, and that might be the case here.\n\nAs for your second transfer, looks like you have sent GBP to an EUR account. In this case the payment method available can only be SWIFT because you're sending GBP to an account located outside of the UK. Please keep in mind with SWIFT there are intermediary banks involved and they'll charge their fees as well. Next time, make sure you're sending EUR instead.\n\nIf you have further questions, please reach us at https://wi.se/contactus_.\n\nAll the best,\nJackie at TransferWise", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2021-02-19', 'CompanyReplyTime': '11:47:33'}
