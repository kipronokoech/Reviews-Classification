We totally understand that verifying your identity can feel like a big step, but it's a crucial one for us. We take the safety of your money and our platform seriously, so we're extra diligent with the process.\n\nWe're really sorry to hear that your account got deactivated, and we don't take that lightly. Usually, this happens when there's a conflict with our Terms of Service or Customer Agreement, or when there's a discrepancy with financial laws. Unfortunately, we can't always provide the exact reason due to regulatory constraints.\n\nIf your appeal was rejected, we won't be able to overturn that decision. However, if you have remaining funds in your account, we'll work on sending them back to you. Just bear with us while we carry out the necessary due diligence checks. Rest assured, your money and information are safe and secure during this process.\n\nIf you have any other questions or concerns, feel free to contact us here: https://wi.se/contactus_, or find us on Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram. Make sure to provide your email address.\n\nWise", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2023-06-15', 'CompanyReplyTime': '08:25:04'}
