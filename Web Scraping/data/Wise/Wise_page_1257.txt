Here is my story:\n1. After many years of having a Personal Account I upgraded to a businesss account.\n2. The verification took 2 weeks not 6 days.\n3. After approval, I started to receive transfers without problem.\n4. This week 2 small transfers were paused as Wise wanted verification again and confirmation of residence, despite the fact that this has already been verified and accepted and, in addition, my Personal account is still active.\n5. So I again upload my passport and confirmation and told it will take 10 days.\n6. In the meantime, my transfers are paused at great inconvenience\n7. My new client did a transfer for my fees of around £1000.00 and this will now bounce back to my client causing me embarrasment as Wise suspend payments in.\n8. Wise no longer allow Chat or phone support and insist on email only, but these take longer as they are understaffed.\n9. I did however phone, waited 46 minutes and got told to wait at least 10 days and 'nothing we can do'\n\nIn conclusion, for a business account where we pay £45 and fees this is extremely poor service.\n\nThe sad fact is that I am lawyer, have sent my passport etc twice and I guess next time I get a transfer Wise will say ' please verify your ID'\n\nWise will probably reply stating ''we have due dilligence and need to verify''. No, I have already been verified and confirmed and your system is glitched and you don't have the staff. Shame on you as for years Wise were excellent and now your standards have dropped.\n\nResolution. In your reply, please do not give the usual robotic template answer 'we apologise etc' I suggest a more pragmatic approach of inviting me to give my Membership number here, you can get someone to bring up my details and sort my account out in minutes. How does that sound as that what I as a customer would expect from a business account. If this can be done I will remove this review and give you 5 stars.", 'review_date': '2022-08-11', 'review_time': '07:21:02', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
