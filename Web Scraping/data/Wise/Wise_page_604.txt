My pension used to arrive from my UK bank account to my Euro account in seconds. Now, since October my transfers are being suspended and I’m having to wait up to 10 working days for my money. I’m being asked to provide proof of my bank account etc before they pay my money. This is unacceptable. Delays in my pension causes me to go overdrawn. I understand money laundering is a big issue but surely they can process payments quicker? As a regular customer they should keep my details on file to ensure a speedy transfer. They are offering me €90 to encourage new customers, how do they expect me to do that?', 'review_date': '2022-12-13', 'review_time': '12:27:51', 'CompanyReply': 'Reply from Wise\nDec 14, 2022\nHello,\n\nWe never want to cause you any extra distress, Alan. While our goal is to complete all payments as fast as we can, we’re a regulated financial institution and as such, we need to carry extra checks on transfers from time to time. This is a routine procedure to help us ensure we’re keeping our platform safe for everyone using (including you) while complying with local regulations.\n\nSpeed is always our priority, but so is diligence. Depending on the case, it can take from hours to several days. Do keep in mind, we always make sure to update you along the way, and you’ll know the status of your transfer at all times.\n\nWise.', 'CompanyReplyDate': '2022-12-14', 'CompanyReplyTime': '13:14:00'}
