Could still be a bit better but so far it has worked amazingly', 'message': 'I like that I can access via an app and a website, that i can add different currencies to my accounts and that i have the card information digitally available.\nOn top of that, after being a victim of credit card fraud I also like that I can freeze the card by myself (instead of calling a bank to block it) and that they wont be able to spent what I havent loaded to the account. Hence I am loading it right before using it and with the precise amount I need! I love the fact that I can load it with my credit card also, as I then gain points for credit card usage and keeping my credit cards safe.\n\nWhat I don’t like so far:\n- that some countries are not included yet (because I really want my sister who lives abroad to have a Wise account and debit card) as I really like the features\n- it’s a bit tricky to find your friends at first and I have had to guide them to allow the account to see their contacts\n- that you cannot receive returns to the card.', 'review_date': '2021-06-26', 'review_time': '23:15:56', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

Then I made a large transfer after they changed ownership and had an absolute nightmare. After a week I was worried after not receiving my money when it usually takes a day or two. Fast forward and after many phone calls, some daily to customer service, apologising and saying they had no access to the money as the middle-man bank was holding it it eventually took over a month and a half to receive. I cannot tell you how stressful the process was, if you use Wise, prepare to wait a very long time and do not rely on it coming in on time at all. I lost a lot of money through bank fees out of desperation to pay for things that needed to be payed for in the process. Customer service were kind every time I spoke to them but also completely helpless. I wouldn’t recommend, however it seems difficult nowadays to find any bank transfer service that is reliable.', 'review_date': '2021-06-26', 'review_time': '23:00:35', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nJun 29, 2021\nHello, Bella.\n\nWe haven't changed ownership, but for a while now we're offering much more than just money transfers and we wanted a name to reflect that. That means it was just a name change, everything else remains the same and it shouldn't in no way affect how you transfer your money or the speed of your payments.\n\nIf you're sending larger amount, due diligence checks might happen. While we aim to complete all checks as fast as possible, sometimes we'll take longer than we first expected, but this is something we must comply with as a regulated financial institution.\n\nWhile checks are being carried, we'll do our best to keep you updated along the way.\n\nAll the best,\nWise Team.", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2021-06-29', 'CompanyReplyTime': '09:44:21'}
