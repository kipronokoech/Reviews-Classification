We understand how frustrating it can be when a transfer doesn't go as expected.\n\nWe never pause a transfer without a reason. Our goal is to complete all payments as quickly as possible, but sometimes delays can occur due to various reasons. For example, if the transfer was set up close to the weekend or during holidays, it may take a bit longer. Additionally, we may need to conduct additional checks for security purposes. You can find more info about this here: https://wi.se/howlongdotransferstake_\n\nAbout your cancelled transfer, if the money was deducted from the sender's account but hasn't reached the receiving bank, please send us a proof of payment. This will help us track the money and resolve the issue for you. If you're unsure about what is a proof of payment, you can find more details here: https://wi.se/whatisaproofofpayment_\n\nPlease upload the document through this link: https://wi.se/senddocument_. Once we receive the necessary info, we'll investigate it and help you.\n\nIf you have any other questions, feel free to contact us through our contact page at https://wi.se/contactus_.
