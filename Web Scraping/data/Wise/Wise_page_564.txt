Their fees for use ( the ones that I can understand) are no problem but the streams of diktats for the verification process are just humiliating and simply not worth the hassle. The whole point of prepaid debit cards is to offer purchasers a degree of privacy and confidentiality due to the fact that they are not linked to bank accounts.\nI also note that this company will not even go through this tedious rigmarole until you have deposited your money into your account, making it difficult to get your money back if your identity cannot be verified.....absolute cheek!\nEDIT OF REVIEW:\nI have retained the above review merely as a context for my review update based on the Wise response below.\nFirstly, I would like to apologize to Wise for the above review as it was based on a misunderstanding on my part. I typed "Wise pre-paid debit cards" into my search engine and duly clicked on what appeared as the appropriate site. I did not realize that this was a debit card attached to an account and not a pre-paid card.\nObviously, the verification process that exists for such accounts is much more rigorous as I have experienced myself in Europe for these accounts. The forementioned pre-paid debit cards in Europe require only an identity card and proof of address, hence my comments about the process with Wise.\nI would kindly ask readers not to make any inferences about Wise based on my initial review above.', 'review_date': '2022-12-20', 'review_time': '15:51:48', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nDec 20, 2022\nHello,\n\nWe're sorry to hear about the hassle, but our card isn't a prepaid card. Our card is a regular debit card, which is linked to your Wise account, and the details within.\n\nWhen you open a bank account, you usually need to provide documents to verify details about yourself. Wise is no different. We’re a regulated financial institution, and verification is how we keep your money safe, and comply with the financial regulations in the countries we operate in. We do our best to complete verification as soon as possible, and it’s usually done within 2 – 4 working days. In rare cases, it might take longer if we need additional information, but we’ll always let you know if that’s the case.\n\nYou can always reach out to us from here: https://wi.se/contactus_ and we'll gladly advise you further.\n\nWise.", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2022-12-20', 'CompanyReplyTime': '13:51:17'}

It worked really well. However since then I have tried a number of relatively small transfers a tiny fraction of the original which have all been delayed for ‘regulatory checks’. I’ve been quoted different timescales and even that it may be longer which doesn’t help planning. I had queries at my previous provider but the delays were nothing like this and always resolved the same day.\nIn short, when it works it’s great but make sure you leave plenty of time for the checks if they need them. If it’s time sensitive do it very early. There doesn’t seem be be any rationale and offers to provide evidence such as bills etc are just met with a standard reply about needing to carry out checks.', 'review_date': '2022-12-20', 'review_time': '13:06:57', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nDec 20, 2022\nHello,\n\nWe aim to get your money moving ASAP, but while our goal is to complete all payments as fast as we can, we’re a regulated financial institution and as such, we need to carry extra checks on transfers from time to time.
