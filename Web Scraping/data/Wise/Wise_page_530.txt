However, you can find some possible reasons here wi.se/accountdeactivation.\n\nIf your account is deactivated, you can appeal here https://wi.se/-appeal, and our appeals team will reach out to you once they have further updates regarding your account. Please keep in mind that this process might take up to 30 working days.\n\nAs for your remaining money in your account, we'll work on sending it back to you.
