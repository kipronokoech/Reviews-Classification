Please understand that it's never our aim to cause any inconvenience.\n\nKeep in mind that payments need to be from a bank account/card that is in your name or your business' name. There are a few reasons why your card might have been rejected. One common reason for an unsuccessful card payment is that your bank has declined it. If this is the case, you'll need to contact the bank to let them know we're a trusted recipient.\n\nFrom your description, it seems like we can't onboard your business. This isn't a decision we take lightly.

{'platform': 'Wise', 'id': '638613fc252cba2c02e774c6', 'stars': 1, 'title': 'HIGHLY SUSPECT: BANK WARNS OF CAUTION', 'message': 'WISE just interjected a 3rd party application ("PLAID") in their regular payment process WITH NO PRIOR notification of a change in their TOS. There is no way to verify who "PLAID" is, how they operate, why they are suddenly interjected in the regular payment process, and if they are governed by US law. PLAID automatically requires access to ALL bank accounts at the financial institution on file with WISE, with NO EXPLANATION as why they request access to accounts even if the accounts are not linked up to WISE. According to the bank\'s warning message, PLAID request for access extends to all account information. This is HIGHLY suspect.\n*** UPDATE: We already had contacted tech support and are still waiting for their reply. Your PR team could have verified the existence of an open support ticket before answering the review. Beside this incongruent order of priorities, even if Wise has "used Plaid for years", it certainly is the FIRST time that Plaid has requested access to our bank accounts. With no prior explanation of what Plaid is and why they request sweeping access to ALL bank accounts, with zero information on how Plaid purports to secure our information, and with our bank flashing warning messages calling for caution (which indicates that they have not seen Plaid interacting with our accounts before), doesn\'t your PR team realize that a complete absence of critical process information is a real issue for clients in the age of sophisticated malicious hacking?', 'review_date': '2022-11-30', 'review_time': '13:11:26', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nUpdated Nov 30, 2022\nHello Phil,\n\nWe understand your concern, and appreciate you take the time to reach out here. We use Plaid because it helps with verifying payments to us, so that we're able to work on your transfers quickly. It's a safe and secure way to connect your bank information, and we wouldn't use this platform if it puts your personal information at risk in any way.
