Due to that, it's currently not possible to turn it off, but we do have a few different types of it, so our support team can certainly advise further on which one would work best for you: https://wise.com/help/contact\n\nAs for requesting additional details, that can indeed happen from time to time - Since we're a regulated financial institution, we're obligated to check each transfer and ask for more information, should it be necessary. Depending on the information asked, we might only need it once, though. Our support team can advise further on this as well.\n\nHope this helps,\nWise team", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2021-07-22', 'CompanyReplyTime': '10:26:46'}
