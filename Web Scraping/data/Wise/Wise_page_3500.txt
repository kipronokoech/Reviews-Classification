Once the security checks were completed, it was straight forward and I would have given them 5 stars.\n\nHowever, I have just tried to use them again. Their fee has gone from £31 to £127 ( in AED equivalent) for the same amount of currency. I checked on the chat and was told that, in order to improve services, they have disabled bank transfers from the UAE and can only do debit card ones, hence the increase. They cannot say when they will accept bank transfers again. How does this improve services is the question?\n\nSorry, but you need to be able to trust organisations when it comes to money, and when fees randomly go up like this (more than quadruple!), then expect to get poor feedback and lost customers.', 'review_date': '2021-01-29', 'review_time': '17:31:16', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nFeb 10, 2021\nThanks for sharing your feedback, Richard.\n\nWe understand your points, and rest assured we're always working hard to keep our fees as low as possible. However, because of local changes in regulations, we can only offer debit card as a payment method for sending out AED. That means the fees have increased because this payment method will in fact cost a bit more.\n\nWe're still working to bring bank transfers back, and until then we'll always be very transparent about our fees.\n\nAll the best,\nJackie at TransferWise", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2021-02-10', 'CompanyReplyTime': '10:01:06'}
