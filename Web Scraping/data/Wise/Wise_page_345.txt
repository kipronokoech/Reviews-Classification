This isn't something we take lightly. It's normally a result of a conflict with our Terms of Service or Customer Agreement, or due to a discrepancy with a financial law. We can't always share the exact reason for the deactivation, due to how we're regulated.\n\nHowever, you can find some possible reasons here: wi.se/accountdeactivation.\n\nOn this link, you can also find which steps you can take next and how to give us your refund details (in case you have remaining balances).\n\nWise", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2023-05-08', 'CompanyReplyTime': '06:49:24'}

I liked the way it worked. Until May 7th. There, a minor transfer was set on pause, while they were requesting proof of my income and asking what my intention was with the account, even if I have been using it for a number of years already. I sent what they needed right away. That started a whole long journey of numerous emails back and forth, starting with them first taking a whole week to respond, then letting me know that the verification process was in progress, then suddenly telling me that it had to start all over and on and on. Finally, I asked to speak with a manager. That was not possible. Then I complained and it took another few weeks for the complaint to be addressed. They offered to compensate me with a symbolic amount for the trouble - and still wanted me to start the verification all over.\nWhat I learned from the whole situation is that Wise customer support is extremely slow and rigid, that it can only be reached by email, and, worst of all, that they are a closed organization - no phone numbers, no last names, no transparency between customer and Wise whatsoever.\nI decided not to trust them with my money moving forward. I prefer my local banks, where I am already verified (without any problems), where I can call customer support, call management if needed, and even meet in person in their local department if needed. I'm more than happy to pay a little bit extra in fees and know that my finances are being taken care of adequately.", 'review_date': '2023-08-04', 'review_time': '19:55:18', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

This is because we need to know who’s using our service, why they’re using it, and that their money comes from a legitimate place. It helps us combat money laundering, and keep everyone’s money safe. That way we can keep providing you even faster, cheaper and more transparent service.\n\nThat's not all – we also have different regulatory requirements in different regions. Because of this, we might need to ask more, or different, questions, depending on where you move money to or from, or where you live.\n\nTo sum it up, we're here for you and your money, but we want to do it safely and securely. And we can assure you we never do this with the intention to cancel a transfer.\n\nIf you have more questions, please reach out to us here: https://wi.se/contactus_ or on Twitter, Facebook or Instagram, with your email and membership number.
