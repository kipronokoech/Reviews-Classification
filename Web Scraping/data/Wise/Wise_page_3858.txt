In contrasts, we're able to accept and send payments locally on both ends.\n\nWe're sorry to hear you feel the CHF to EUR route is costly, and if you would wish to make comparisons in price to any other provider, you can find our fees here: https://wi.se/ourfees For this particular route, a bank transfer option would have a fee of 0.56 CHF + 0.43%, for example.\n\nBest wishes,\nTransferWise Team", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2020-11-11', 'CompanyReplyTime': '12:48:35'}
