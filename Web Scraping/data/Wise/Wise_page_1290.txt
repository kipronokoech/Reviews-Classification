The service level of WISE is just terrible. I have rarely seen such disrespectful, unprofessional and incompetent level of work towards client service. I can substantiate all those assertions with facts, i.e.:\n\n- WISE has ZERO functioning client support interface. they switched-off the chat with the support team and suggest that the client sends an email without indicating the email address\n- when i used email - the automated response said that WISE does not even consider emails.\n- the substantive matter is that WISE decided to close my business account for a WRONG or FALSE reason. Imagine this - there is no reason at all, but they are closing it and there is no media to object and make them reconsider this.', 'review_date': '2022-08-04', 'review_time': '19:12:38', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nUpdated Aug 5, 2022\nHello Vladimir,\n\nSorry to hear your account was deactivated.
