We believe the information we offer different bank account details for different currencies, is very well displayed and within reach. Also note that not only with us, but with any bank account, you can only send out the currency that account supports - except if you have a specific denominated account, for which you have applied beforehand in accordance to your bank. That means, you'd know in advance if you could send a different currency there or not. You are not to assume (with us or any other company) that you can send any currency to an account, and that would be supported. Conversion is not done automatically.\n\nThat means your EUR account can only receive EUR, your USD account can only receive USD and so on. When you send the incorrect currency, the payment is rejected automatically and sent back to the sender. The money was never received. This is an incoming payment that failed, therefore it is up to the sender's bank to locate - by tracing it or recalling it- it should be possible from their side.\n\nWise.", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2021-12-24', 'CompanyReplyTime': '09:37:46'}
