Paid the transfer and fees. Then my supplier tried to add his details and couldn't due to TransferWise having a system that while offering this doesn't allow it. I was told I needed to cancel my transfer at my cost losing fee's and possible exchange rates losing me more money which I wont know until my refund is back into my bank. That's the other issue it takes 10 days so now I cant even pay my supplier and I will now be late with the payment. I know refunds take time but the reason for refund is there fault not mine and now ive lost money and my supplier says I missed my payment deadline and also charged me.\n\nUPDATE\nThey have actually charged my card twice for the same transaction so now im out of pocket by 2 lots of the funds\n\nUPDATE\nIn the 4th attempt to get this sorted they finally put things right.

This is just how the process goes for card refunds. About the double charge, we'd like to take a closer look at what's going on with that.
