I have a Bank of America account, but international wire transfers are quite difficult and expensive. So, I went through Wise\'s application process, sent them my IDs, business documents, detailed explained my business they asked many times for new and new info. After all of these, they approved and opened my US bank account and issued me a debit card which came to me in 3 days. Everything was ok, so I connected their account with Stripe, started a business and for weeks I was getting payments from my customers, sent money internationally without any problems.\nAnd I didn\'t get some big payments usually 500-2000$ per day, but one day Stripe deposited to Wise account like 3300 USD and I checked the Wise account and the payment didn\'t appear for a day or two which was very unusual. And when I woke up in the morning, I was signed off the Wise account and when I tried to log in, it just said: "your account is deactivated". They never ever contacted me by phone, email nothing, just closed my account, let stripe deposit more money to them. So I filled out and started the appeal process, sent them many many emails to their support, and NOTHING. No response, just getting emails like somebody will be in touch with you within 24 hrs. 24 hrs passed many times and nothing. No response. So they tried to kill my new business, took money from the stripe (they stated that they need to do due diligence and maybe they will return my money later don\'t know when...).\nSo, please, especially business owners. DON\'T USE WISE FOR BANK ACCOUNT.\nThey will take your money, close your account without any notice and they WILL NEVER EVER respond to you.\nI am done with them, so I will stay at Bank of America.\nI must say that I provided them with ALL business info, my website, what I am doing and how, explained them everything. I am NOT doing something bad, nothing illegal and bad, just regular business (freight forwarding).\nSeems like a complete scam to me. I am out of 5k USD for now and not getting answers from them...
