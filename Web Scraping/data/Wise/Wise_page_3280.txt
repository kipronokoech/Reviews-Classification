Their rates are better and their service is second to none, with the transferred cash arriving in my Spanish account within minutes!\n\nArranging the transfer online is quick and easy and, so far, I can't recommend them too highly. Several of my friends use Wise and are also extremely satisfied.\n\nAs an example of my latest, most recent, transfer of £1000, I received €1,146.83, with the next nearest offering being €1,121.10.
