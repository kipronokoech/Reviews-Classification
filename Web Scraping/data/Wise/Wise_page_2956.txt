Always more likely to get a decent review, that way. That said, am very happy to write it.\n\nOn from my Trustpilot review of some time back - which was also a very good rating, latest is tech issues with VPN use, since resolved, principally by working out for myself but thereafter with assistance and suggested possibles/probables from the tech team.\n\nIt seems likely that that the app is liable to disallowing full account access -in my case to my \'cards\' section- should a VPN have been selected in a country that does not offer a card facility. Bit odd. I travel extensively anyway and could be where I say I am, actually!\n\nHowever.. noted!\n\nI have respectfully suggested Transferwise (dislike the new name \'Wise\' - not in any way descriptive of what it does and a bit ugly in its monosyllablism.. doubt that\'s a word until now and probably not how you\'d spell it but I\'m busy and who is reading this anyway?!)\n\ner.. where was I.. too busy to care.. why am I writing this.. SO much to do..\n\n..advises all clients of this likely issue.\n\nIt seems simple enough to fix.. so far, anyway..\n\nSuggested advise to clients from Transferwise..?\n"Using a VPN? Use one that has an IP address from your own country for best chance of full account access."\n\n\nThere.. I\'ve even written it for them!\n\nThe assistance is thorough and rapid. This is only my second experience of client service back up and it is very supportive, including a continued propensity to update and quickly acknowledge etc.. not something one can presume from Customer services generally.\n\nTech issues aside - and most likely self-imposed - I say well done to TW. and, if I may name names, a thank you to Bernadett in particular.\n\nRubbish grammar and sentence construction here, I know. Typos, faux pas.. you name it..\n\nPlease don\'t rate my review!', 'review_date': '2021-08-19', 'review_time': '01:42:45', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
