First, although advertised as an instantaneous transfer, and paid for by credit card, Wise informs me that it will in fact take an extra day, for additional 'security checks.' Then, the next day, Wise writes to say - and I kid you not - that they require a photo of my passport, a photo of me holding it, and a 'few lines' detailing the reason for the transfer. Are you kidding me?? This _might_ be understandable for $10,000 - for a fully prepaid $100 it most definitely is not. I immediately made the same transfer with Wise's best-known competitor, which went through immediately, and at a lower cost! Cancelled the pending transfer with Wise, and left thoroughly unimpressed.\n\n*Edit*: With respect to Wise's response below - nonsense. There were already sufficient security checks on my transfer (both from you and my credit card company), these were ridiculous, over-the top demands for a small, prepaid transfer (hardly 'routine' - and could actually be seen as a security risk, given the nature and extent of the information you were requesting), and your competitor required none of that. All of these services are subject to the same regulations and, while security is of course paramount, applying that security in such a way that it does not impose an unreasonable burden on the client and completely negate the inherent usefulness of the service is your job. All large tech financial services do it on the daily, and you failed miserably at it - hence why I took my business elsewhere.\n\nAs a postscript I would add that potential clients should be careful when watching YouTube videos sponsored by Wise - I have made the same comment more than once on these, and each time they get deleted, without explanation.", 'review_date': '2022-07-14', 'review_time': '23:30:31', 'CompanyReply': 'Reply from Wise\nOct 29, 2021\nHello there,\n\nWhile our goal is to complete all payments as fast as we can, we‚Äôre a regulated financial institution and as such, we need to carry extra checks on transfers from time to time.

Imagine that, 60 days for a review while you have to pay your employees, who rely on you to pay their bills and put food on the table for their families!!!\n5- Wise is a disgusting and pathetic company that lies, literally does not help you when you need it, if you are any serious business I would highly recommend you stay away from this company or leave this company immediately!!!
