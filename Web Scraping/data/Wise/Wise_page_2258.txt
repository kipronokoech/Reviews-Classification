Don\'t believe them when they say it only takes 2 working days to get to you. It takes 7 working days.

This took 7 working days (with weekend 9 days). And it would have taken longer if I didn\'t shout at the forex department of Capitec on day 7. Biggest pain: for all of this time I didn\'t know where the money was. The flow sketched above only became clear after my 2nd phone call to Wise from Johannesburg to London on day 7.
