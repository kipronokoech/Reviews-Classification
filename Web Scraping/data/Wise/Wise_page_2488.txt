I was traveling myself and inadvertently discovered this fact while reading my email.\n\nWhile trying to connect to the Wise platform, I learned that my account had been blocked without any further notice. I have not been able to access my assets for 15 days, my Wise credit cards are also blocked and no one is responding to my emails requesting the reinstatement of my account. I can't even access their chat or customer service anymore since it is only possible through their platform. So I have to consider a costly and heavy legal action to recover the money I had deposited on my account, after having searched for the location of their head office, on which WISE is curiously very discreet, to open an action\n\nFortunately I have other accounts with other providers, but imagine my situation when I travel if I only had Wise to pay my expenses and bills. So be very careful. It would appear from this type of behavior that WISE could be in serious trouble or close to bankruptcy.", 'review_date': '2021-12-03', 'review_time': '09:39:06', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nDec 27, 2021\nHi there,\nWe're sorry to hear about your experience.\n\nHowever, you can be sure that we never close any accounts without a strong reason.
