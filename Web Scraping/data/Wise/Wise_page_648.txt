Email support takes 24 hours MINIMUM.

Your account WILL not work with accepting transfers from Paypal, you can\'t use your Wise account to pay via Venmo or ApplePay, it will not accept any "instant eligible transfers" from other institutions (it will take 10x longer than just "waiting" for it to arrive) and when it doesn\'t go right... you have NO one to turn to to help.\n\nI used to recommend TransferWise to people without the slightest reservation.
