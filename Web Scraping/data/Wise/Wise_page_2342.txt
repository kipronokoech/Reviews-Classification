I dialed the 800 number with fear and trepidation fearing long wait times, incompetent service providers, or folks who were difficult to understand.\n\nI found the wait times to be short, the associate delightful and easy to understand. She helped me find the menu option I had missed, and since then I have enjoyed all the benefits Wise provides without the need for further assistance.
