Last week they paused my transfers asking me to verify my account and provide proof of incomes, even though I\'ve done this several times in the past. Nevertheless, I\'ve upload all required documents, and even gave Wise access to my main bank account (which I think it is a bit intrusive). It\'s been a week now and my account still frozen due verification, customer service and help center unable to provide any answers or help me. Even worst I have no ways to take my money out, as Wise does not allow me to make any other transfer. It\'s humiliating and incredible frustrating.\n\nThey keep sending emails saying "the need to verify the accounts to comply with regulations" or that my documents "are being reviewed and the process will be completed soon" but days go by and nothing happens and there is no way to talk to anyone.\n\n-------UPDATES------\n\nSince my initial review (1 star) the problem above was resolved. However, it took over 1 week and only after I sent 6 months payslips, Tax returns, and gave then access to my main bank account. Bear in mind, they froze my account after a 50 euros transfer to a 3rd party. It seems excesive. And the overall customer support was very poor.

Two months in a row, they hold my money without any explanation.\nSo, the first case:\nMy customer issued a SWIFT payment on September 7. On the next day, Wise asked for additional details for "verification". No prob, all the information had been sent. They stated that money should arrive within 2 days - est. September 10-11. And, of course, my customer could send me the transfer confirmation so my bank can use the MT103 sample to allocate the payment.\nOn September 21, there\'s still nothing. Wise claims that the funds have been transferred successfully. The money arrived on September 27th. And, of course, the MT103 sample differs from the one in their transfer confirmation. The date of the transfer was September 21 - just when my customer contacted them for the 5th time.\n\nThe second case:\nMy customer sent me a transfer on October 4. Wise states that there\'s nothing on their end; the transfer was successful. I have contacted my bank with the new payment confirmation. Nothing. Okay, my client wrote to Wise again, and now they demand my bank statement for October with all incoming and outgoing payments. We sent them the bank statement. Three days after - nothing.
