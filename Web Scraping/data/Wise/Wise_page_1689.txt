Wise is no different. We’re a financial institution, so we need to know who’s using our service. It helps us combat money laundering, and keep everyone’s money safe.\nWe accept these documents to verify your identity:\n- Passport (photo page only)\n- National ID card (we only accept the most recent version of the Nigerian national ID card)\n- Photo driver’s licence (we cannot accept Electronic Driving License)"\n\nAbove a certain amount I can understand your concern about money laundering. But to send family members sometimes a small amount of money? Really? I am suspicious that Wise needs our data for something else. Wise is not a bank, nor police or any similar. It\'s a company which harvest money from us and a fkn app on our phone. It\'s like when Facebook wants our ID. It\'s a big nope for me. You can keep my account blocked. Goodbye.\n\nUpdate 30.05.2022.\nAnswer to your answer:\n"We ask these documents to know our customer, and to make the platform safe..."\nI do not want to know you and I do not want you to know me. (Anyway you can see all personal and bank account info when we use Wise to send money from A to B.) I only want to use your service and pay for your service. Nothing more.\nThe bank account where I send the money from belongs to me, yeah? So once my bank once identified me, yeah? This is how do I have a bank account, yeah?\nSo you do not need to identify me or anyone for sure.\nAnd in that case if someone would steal my username and password for my bank account and would send money from it anywhere it wouldn\'t be your problem either, yeah? You would say "contact with your bank, because we ca not help you to solve this".\nProbably I would realize the problem very quickly and would report it to my bank, not to Wise.\nSo it is still bulls...t what you are saying. I won\'t send you any picture ID for sure. I choose to pay a bit more and will do all transfers from my bank account.\n\n"2.2 Information we collect about you\nWith regard to your use of our Services we may automatically collect the following information:\n(a) details of the transactions you carry out when using our Services, including geographic location from which the transaction originates;\n(b) technical information, including the Internet protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer to the Internet, your login information, browser type and version, time zone setting, browser plug-in types and versions, operating system and platform;\n(c) information about your visit, including the full Uniform Resource Locators (URL) clickstream to, through and from our Website or App (including date and time); products you viewed or searched for; page response times, download errors, length of visits to certain pages, page interaction information (such as scrolling, clicks, and mouse-overs), and methods used to browse away from the page and any phone number used to call our Customer Support number.\n\n2.3 Information we receive from other sources.\nWe may receive information about you if you use any of the other websites we operate or the other services we provide.
