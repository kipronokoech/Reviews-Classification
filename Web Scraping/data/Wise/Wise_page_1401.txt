But when my most recent transfer was estimated to take 5 business days, I was dismayed. Nevertheless, I saw that there was an alternative means of sending the money through a manual transfer. My own bank account required verification of the Wise Wells Fargo account, a standard protocol involving 2 tiny deposits made and subsequent confirmation of their exact amounts. This itself could take 2 days but I figured that since it was quicker, it would be worth it. I contacted Wise customer service after 2 days so I could complete the verification and I didn't so much as receive acknowledgement that they understood what I was requesting. It had already taken ages before the chat function engaged a customer service rep and then replies after that took 5 minutes or longer. After nearly a half hour with very few responses from Wise (and of those few, the responses were patronizing, unhelpful, and offered redundant information as if I had never utilized Wise before), I gave up on customer service and cancelled the manual transfer. I went back to the ACH transfer and it was indeed completed in 5 business days. Unfortunately, the delay was never explained. I don't see any point in trying customer service again should another issue arise. I've been a loyal customer for years but I'm very disappointed.", 'review_date': '2022-07-16', 'review_time': '14:26:36', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nSep 27, 2022\nHello!\n\nWe aim to complete all transfers as fast as possible, but delays can happen for different reasons.
