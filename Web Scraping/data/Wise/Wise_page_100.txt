{'platform': 'Wise', 'id': '64f57c49660fa6b6cec9a17c', 'stars': 4, 'title': 'Best digital bank, but I only keep a small amount of my money in it', 'message': 'I\'ve been using Wise for approximately seven years now (back when it was called TransferWise), and I continue to be amazed by its excellence. Wise embodies the ideal that every bank should aspire to be. To be frank, it\'s quite shocking to observe how subpar the typical online banking experience is in comparison. Wise is to banking what flying cars are to the future, except they\'ve made it a reality: low fees or no fees for money transactions and currency exchange. Opening an account is a breeze, even from your mobile device. As of September 2023 (the time of writing this review), there are now multiple similar products on the market (such as Revolut and N26), but Wise still shines brightly.\n\nHowever, this is not to say that everything is flawless. The issues worth noting are as follows:\n\n(Very bad): While it hasn\'t happened to me, I had a friend who was unexpectedly banned from Wise. He had been using Wise to purchase cryptocurrencies, which goes against Wise\'s terms and conditions. This wasn\'t an issue until Wise altered its terms and conditions. My friend was unaware of this change, and his account was frozen without prior notice. His initial panic, fearing his funds were lost, left a lot to be desired in terms of user experience. After reaching out to support, he had no option but to transfer his entire balance to another account. This incident serves as a reminder that, unlike more established banks, Wise is still a startup. I would recommend against placing all your funds in Wise until they gain more stability.\n\n(Bad) In relation to the previous point, Wise\'s customer support is not as robust as that of traditional banks. Despite their drawbacks, traditional banks maintain extensive support teams. This means that when you encounter a significant issue (and we all know these come up from time to time), you can generally expect a resolution by contacting your old bank, even if it takes a considerable amount of time. With Wise, depending on the nature of the problem, you may find yourself frustrated.\n\n(Bad) There used to be no fees on the amount held, but now there are fees when you exceed a certain threshold (which varies from one region to another and is also currency-dependent).\n\n(Not great) The user experience can be a bit flawed when sending money to another Wise user. You might expect that they could easily detect which of your contacts uses Wise based on their phone number, but sometimes this feature doesn\'t work correctly. This may lead you to opt for a direct transfer using their email, which may show a fee associated with the transaction, leaving you puzzled and wondering, "What\'s happening? I\'m fairly certain this user also uses Wise."\n\n(Not great) Similar to the previous point, you may have manually added a contact (let\'s call them John) and later discovered how to add John as a Wise user. Consequently, John appears twice in your contacts, once with a blue tick indicating they are a Wise user and once without. This can be confusing. It would be more convenient if you could merge these accounts later.\n\nDespite these noted drawbacks, I still hold Wise in high regard. I use it on a daily basis, and its advantages far outweigh its disadvantages. Nevertheless, I don\'t keep all my funds in Wise; the majority is held in traditional banks.\n\nIf someone were to ask me for a recommendation for an online bank offering both physical and virtual cards, I would still wholeheartedly recommend Wise.', 'review_date': '2023-09-04', 'review_time': '08:42:17', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nSep 7, 2023\nHey Nicolas,\nWe appreciate you taking your time to give us feedback.
