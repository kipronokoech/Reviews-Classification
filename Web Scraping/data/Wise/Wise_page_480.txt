While our goal is to complete all payments as fast as we can, weâ€™re a regulated financial institution and as such, we need to carry extra checks on transfers from time to time. This is a routine procedure to help us ensure weâ€™re keeping our platform safe for everyone using (including you) while complying with local regulations.\n\nHere's a list of documents we accept: https://wi.se/business-sow\n\nWe always make sure to make this process as smooth as painless as possible. Not only that, but speed is always our priority, but so is diligence. Depending on the case, it can take from hours to several days.\n\nWe appreciate your understanding and patience highly.\n\nWise", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2023-02-28', 'CompanyReplyTime': '12:22:05'}

You can even spend money from the MMM with their card - awesome!\n\nWould be great for them to get a banking license so people can feel more secure.\n\nSince I'm converting less than 1000Â£ per month I use Revolut to do so.
