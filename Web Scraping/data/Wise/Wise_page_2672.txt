I did not choose Wise to receive my money instantaneously. I did this so that it would show in my passbook as an international transfer. Last Friday I sent my money as usual using the 'Funds for...' option and it was sent, in seconds, to Kasikorn Bank which forwarded it to Bangkok Bank as a 'local transfer of funds' thereby denying me the 'International Tranfer' annotation in my Passbook. This will now cause problems with Thai Immigration when I have to extend my permission to stay.\nAll this was done with no prior notification to me about the change.\nNOT GOOD Wise.
