We're sorry to hear that your latest experiences haven't been the best. When a payment returns to us, then it usually happens from the recipient's ban side, so reaching out to them might give you a bit more clarify about it as well.\n\nVerification usually doesn't take this long if you've shared the relevant documents with us, but it's a case by case situation and depends on the nature of verification. Our team always wants to get those checks done as fast as possible, and we'll always make sure to keep you updated via email.\n\nIf you have any questions, or need help, we'd be more than happy to sort it out for you: https://wi.se/contactus_ so your future payments would go through smoothly.", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2023-04-19', 'CompanyReplyTime': '12:03:41'}
