I don’t know what I would have done without it (probably made a lot of painfully slow and expensive cross-currency transfers).

I’m using it as my main account, even receiving my salary in it as they seem more competent than the banks I’ve opened accounts with in the US. The local banking details they offer help greatly with this.\n\nThe only reason I’m not giving 5 stars is because there was a single hiccup where the app appeared to execute two sizable direct debits a second time.

After a small USD-EUR test, I sent a much larger amount. Because I got a better exchange rate at our bank, I tried to send it from our little-used EUR account, which I don\'t often think about. In fact Wise did NOT remove the money from our EUR account. I was looking at the original withdrawal from our USD account.\n\nHowever, I give Wise a low rating for its complete lack of personalized customer service. There is no way to contact them other than an "appeal" form. That\'s a red flag.\n\nIn closing the account and saying "we can\'t and won\'t tell you why" (the wretched Western Union did the same, so I guess I\'m on somebody\'s list :-). Wise could have said, "We did not remove the €X,XXX from your account" instead something like "if we took money from your account, we\'ll maybe get around to returning it one day." Which pretty much sums up their message. I don\'t think it would be too much of a programming challenge to personalize the message, and the fact that Wise thinks so little of its customers that they don\'t include a little reassurance in their f-you letter is another red flag.\n\nSo my apologies to Wise for my erroneous conclusion, but I still don\'t think much of them as a business. Lots of improvement needed in professionalism, and actually having customer service wouldn\'t be a bad thing.\n_____________________________\nUPDATE: what a horsesh_t reply from Wise.
