One week after the money was supposed to have arrived, we found out by chance that it had arrived in another persons account. This person had also expected to receive a transfer, also one week late. The sum he received was incorrect and being an honest man he returned the money. It has been confirmed received by Transferwise partner Exchange4free, but they still have not taken any steps to pay out the money to the correct recipient. They rather "investigate" than provide customer service.\nThis issue have now been sorted out and the correct recipient eventually paid. There was nothing incorrect in the recipients stated details, but Transferwise banking partner apparently had a major systems problem. I realize matters have to be investigated before a system is considered to be operational again, but it should still be possible to make overrides to ensure that the recipient receives their money until the system can be trusted again.
