I used to feel so comfortable keeping my money with them and saw them as a second bank. But on that fateful day, without warning, I just noticed my account had been deactivated. They rejected my appeal and showed me my remaining balance of which I noticed some of my money had been reversed, according to their 'terms and conditions' but without giving further details about the reversal. They also told me I'm yet to submit my bank details, even though I actually did when I submitted my appeal. It's obvious they are playing games with my money and are not showing any transparency under the guise of 'how we are regulated' and their 'terms and conditions'. Also, when your account gets closed, their customer service to you becomes terrible. I strongly discourage the people I know and anybody reading this from opening an account with them, I can see that 85% of the reviews are 'excellent' which might make my review irrelevant but not intending to be a prophet of doom, many of those reviewers will eventually get their accounts closed. Anybody doubting this review can do an online search about them. I don't have any issue if a company decides to no longer offer me their services but I do have an issue if they hold on to my money and show no transparency", 'review_date': '2021-09-24', 'review_time': '21:12:13', 'CompanyReply': 'Reply from Wise\nOct 7, 2021\nHello Olajide,\n\n\nWhen an account is closed with balances, we need to carry due diligence checks first.
