Today is 11th July and these checks have never been complete, and the money has never come on my end. Needless to say, day by day, my life continues to become vulnerable as a result of wise extended checks causing the lack of money in my life. I am living just because in this world exists money lenders from whom I am able to borrow from to sustain my life and I’ll have to pay off with interest whenever I will receive this money. It is sad to note that while wise carries out the regulatory checks, they forget all about the time value of money. Although I do understand the regulatory check is a standard industrial practice that wise has to carry out as an online regulated financial institution, the extended checks makes for a lot to pick out;\n1. It is certain that wise holds some transfers to carry out checks when there is not adequate personnel to carry out the checks on time thus causing the delayed processing of information on the statuses of the transfers. Simply put, wise is currently overwhelmed by the huge number of customers using their app.\n2. More than once, wise reminds that they are regulated financial institution that has to carry out the checks, and thus they are not responsible for the transfer delays caused as a result of these checks: In all conscience, this statement is one that has for long left me compromised and it shapes my inquiry to wise: In the context that I am simply your customer; receiving or sending money, and you are the intermediary responsible for sending the money out, if you are given the money to send out and it is delayed on your end as a result of the checks you carry out, then who bears the responsibility for the delay or what is responsibility to wise in this context?\nDear Wise, every dawning of the sun raise, I wake up hoping to receive my money yet every sunset I have not been able to receive the money. Thus, every day I wake up a hopeful being believing I will get the money and every day I go back to bed a sad person; this for more than one month now. Could I say, this delay has and is causing me a lot of financial distress, mood swings, and sorrow? It bothers to see how you have all overlooked the importance of money in human life; it concerns to recognize how a customer has to beg for their legitimate money from your company. This delay is HURTING; it is AFFECTING. How I wish a swift decision is reached to either continue the transfer or refund the sender.\nADVICE TO WISE MANAGEMENT\n1.
