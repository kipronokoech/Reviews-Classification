The 1st of these was a disaster but I didn't know it until about a week later when the money was never paid. This person, whose name I don't recall, was really dangerous based on my results. When I called on Tuesday to ask why my transfer didn't happen, this gentleman was great - patient, precise, pleasant... Please thank him again for being so great. Your phone lines have been VERY difficult to make contact; maybe you are trying to advertise and expand faster than your staff can manage?

Someone took over control of my account and made unauthorized payments within Wise. When tried to block/secure my account, the website and phone app were non responsive. I have reported every transaction within minutes using Help Center. Reported in addition to the Customer Service by phone ( claim 204 961 71) within an hour or so of the fraud in order to have the fastest possible reaction and black these transfers. I was assured that Wise fraud team is working on it and will hear back within a day from them. It has been 30hours so far and no response, no customer service update as well. In the meantime I have reported the crime to the police in UK (action fraud), to Interpol through my local police and to FCA that regulates Wise. I am still hopefull that Wise will take care of this issue and refund me my money asap. I just wish if someone would update me on the process.
