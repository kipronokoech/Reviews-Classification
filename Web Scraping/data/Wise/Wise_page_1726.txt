Im posting this hear in hopes someone from wise reaches out about fixing this problem, if not for me, for other customers.\n\nAll banks are subjected to KYC verifications and anti money laundering verifications. I think that is great, I hate crime and money laundering like the next person.\n\nI have 4 bank accounts in different banks.\n\nOn monday Wise froze a payment I received, from my OWN bank account with another bank and asked for source of funds. I have been transfering money like this every 2 weeks for many months now. And, they could have just asked me for the documentation at ANY time, like ALL other banks do. But instead the decided the best moment to do it is when they were holding my funds hostage.\n\nthe cash flow of my business is now seriously disrupted, and because of a back log on their customer service (probably because they are having some glitches on the website for other reasons) I am still waiting for my funds to be released.\n\nthere are no indications on my account of any new type of activity, everything is exactly as it was last month, the month before that and the one before that. Why then wait to verify my source of funds when I receive a big payment?\n\nThat is a horrible though out process and no other bank has ever done that to me in the 11 years I am in Business. I am hopping this review gets picked up by Wise staff so that can assume me not only my funds will be realeased, but they will improve on how they deal with this type of verification for the benefit of other users of their system.\n\nthank you', 'review_date': '2022-05-18', 'review_time': '13:00:13', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
