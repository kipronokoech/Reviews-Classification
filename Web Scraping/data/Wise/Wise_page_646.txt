You\'ll get like 1 email from somebody in India once a week, so if you are unable to upload a document because of a bug, then bam! Your account is blocked!\n\nThey went on another "Document verification" spree last week and gave me 5 days to provide the documents. This time, it was for me personally and not my company, as they just verified it again...\n\nThey asked for: salary slips, bank statements from my other personal bank account N26, employment contract, and tax returns. Note: I didn\'t use Wise personally and have 2K EUR on it; why on earth do they need this much information? Like, I have always had my personal bank account with N26 and Deutsche Bank, and never was I asked to provide such documents with a 5-day notice other than when I created the account.\n\nAnyway, I first sent them an email when I got their email notification and asked to talk to a real person and get more information on why they needed stuff like my employment contract, pay slips, and especially bank statement from my other bank.\n\nNo reply.\n\nI then sent out a daily email after noticing that they didn\'t reply.\n\nThen yesterday, I proceeded with just uploading the documents, and guess what? There is a technical error with their system that prevents uploads...\n\nI now have exactly 1 day left before they apparently block my account, and It\'s literally impossible to provide them with what they are asking!\n\nHow on earth is something like this possible? This is the first time in my life that I am feeling like a criminal all because of their awful system...\n\nAgain: it\'s impossible to speak to anyone and I am getting no responses, but am being threatened to have the account block in a day!', 'review_date': '2022-12-06', 'review_time': '10:42:30', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nDec 7, 2022\nHello,\n\nWe're sorry to hear about your experience, and this hassle.
