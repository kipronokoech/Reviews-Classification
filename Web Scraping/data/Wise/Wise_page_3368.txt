Some months ago I had to drop my email account and have tried to change to Gmail, but Wise will not allow me to do this. It has got progressively harder to contact Wise. I finally manage to get on a chat and was told they could not help and I would need to phone someone with Wise. I was offered a link to a phone number for my area, which just took me around the same old loop for help leaving me fed up and frustrated. It was good while it lasted, but I feel like its time to change horses.\nEdit.....Thank you Wise for your help. Jason was amazing, so patient, knowledgeable and efficient.
