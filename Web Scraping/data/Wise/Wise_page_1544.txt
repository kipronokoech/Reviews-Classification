Secondly, I understand the security concerns but I have been Wise for almost 2 years and this is quite inconveniencing. I enrolled with Wise for both Security and convenience but based on this experience, this is very inconveniencing and the damaged trust Wise cannot repair.\nI have now sent you a contract. My consultancy pay is USD7,000. I have two running loans: USD1,500 and USD2,200 bringing a total to USD3,700 and a net pay of USD3,300.
