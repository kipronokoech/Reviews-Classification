This isn't something we take lightly. It's normally a result of a conflict with our Terms of Service or Customer Agreement, or due to a discrepancy with a financial law. We can't share the exact reason of the deactivation, due to how we're regulated. However, you can find some possible reasons here wi.se/accountdeactivation.\n\nIf you already submitted the appeal, then our relevant team will contact you withing 20 working days. We do understand that this is a long time, but this process requires a lot of diligence.\n\nAs for your remaining money in your account, we'll work on sending it back to you. But first, we need to carry out due diligence checks. While we do that, your money and information will be safe and secure.\n\nWise", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2022-10-31', 'CompanyReplyTime': '10:47:25'}

Had one challenge with regards to an authorized theft from a Pizza company and Wise took care of it immediately. Have recently moved to Germany and now utilizing the euro, simple process!
