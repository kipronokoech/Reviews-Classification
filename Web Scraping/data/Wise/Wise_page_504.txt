No need to worry, if it's not on your bank account immediately.\nSome banks are just slower than others — they might take up to a few working days for them to release the money. So your money’s safely on its way, but the receiving bank is still processing it. You can ask your bank to speed this up. You’ll need a transfer receipt that has all the details.\nHere's how to download it: https://wi.se/getpdfreceipt\n\nWise", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2023-02-07', 'CompanyReplyTime': '20:47:35'}
