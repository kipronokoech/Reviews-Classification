It's often a result of a conflict with our Terms of Service or Customer Agreement, or due to a discrepancy with a financial law. We can't always share the exact reason for the deactivation, due to how we're regulated.\n\nIf you think we’ve made a mistake, you can follow these guidelines to appeal our decision: https://wi.se/accountdeactivation. We’ll review your request and get back to you ASAP via email.\n\nIf you still have money in your account, we'll work on sending it back to you. But first, we need to carry out due diligence checks.

That's because the markets being volatile makes it more expensive for us to buy and sell currencies. That being said, we’re always looking for ways to bring them back down. And we continue to invest in our infrastructure, so that you can move money faster and more conveniently.\n\nRegarding card disputes, we have our specialized team working on every dispute meticulously. We understand that sending over the same document might not be ideal, however, we might ask you to upload a document again if the quality isn't good enough, if there's missing information or if the document format isn't among the ones we can accept.\n\nWe take your feedback very seriously, as it helps us grow.

I feel it\'s essential to share my experience to help others make an informed decision.\n\nDuring my second encounter with Wise, I attempted to add funds to my Wise account from my personal credit card to make use of the multi-currency feature. However, my funds were inexplicably held, and Wise requested a slew of personal financial documents, including salary pay slips, tax declarations, and even loan contracts. I promptly uploaded all the necessary documents as requested, only to receive a message stating, "We are reviewing your information. There\'s nothing you need to do. We\'ll get in touch if we need anything."\n\nAs a frequent traveler who relies on Wise for international transactions, this delay and the lack of responsiveness from their customer support were highly frustrating. Imagine being in a foreign country, needing access to your funds urgently, and having to wait for Wise to review your documents while their customer support is unresponsive, especially over the weekends. It\'s an inconvenience that no traveler should have to endure.\n\nIn summary, my recent experience with Wise has left me questioning its reliability as a financial service provider for travelers. While it has its merits, the lack of customer support staff, weekend closures, and a 14-day response policy have soured my opinion.\n\nI cannot recommend Wise to fellow travelers based on my recent experience.
