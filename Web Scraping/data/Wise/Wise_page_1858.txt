I’ve wrote about it to the support and got the answer that I need to verify my identity. I’ve sent the documents from my business account more than month ago but didn’t get any answer till today. I also tried to verify my personal account and it was verified. I’ve wrote to support and they answered that my business partner are also need to verify her address of another country on her personal account. She has sent:\n1. The utility bill – was declined;\n2. Notarized lease agreement – was declined;\n3. Government registration – was declined;\n4. Bank transfer statement – was declined;\nAfter sending the bank transfer statement her account was disabled without any reason. She didn’t get any emails from support. She had keeped 5600GBP of our company, and now our LLP can’t use it, it has stuck on her account. Moreover, our LLP account on hold and can’t receive the money, so we were left without any funds. In my opinion the only reason of not verifying my business UK account and disabling the personal account of our partner after sending all required documents is discrimination. They don’t care where are you living, if you are Russian. I think it’s just hype on the trendy topic of hate. No one cares about your opinion on putin. I’ve opened my company in order not to depend on crazy russian government, but now my life is depend on transferwise authorities, for me it is the same now!", 'review_date': '2022-04-22', 'review_time': '18:18:48', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
