I bought some products against cancer for her. She is a lawyer and I am a journalist. We were shocked when we got information about Wise will keep the money because of some investigation.ðŸ˜± My account is a private acc, sometimes receive some money from my friends and buy instead of them some Rain or MDC products, but very rarely as they are old people who have no cards. Sometimes transfer some small amounts to my relatives. I have never ever had a bigger transaction than 300â‚¬. After we sent a few emails to Wise, we got this answer:\n\nHello Stela,\n\nThanks for sending us the information.\nWe understand you want to get your money moving. As of now, our team is currently reviewing your information.\nPlease note that while your transfer is undergoing review, regular support agents wonâ€™t be able to give you updates â€” only our specialized team can. But bear in mind this can take up to 10-15 working days. If we need some extra information, weâ€™ll let you know.\nIf the review is successful, you donâ€™t need to do anything â€” we\'ll email you once we send the payment out.\n\nWe really appreciate your patience and co-operation in this regard.\nI hope that helps. Let me know if you have any questions â€“ if not, have a great weekend!\n\nSxxxxx/ Wise\n\nSo, they said, if some "special agents" will decide this transaction would be ok, they will update me :) It is like kindergarten. They took our money, and keep it for weeks or months, or as I read, they never give money back to some people and keep it for who knows which purpose. I just want my money in my account or let them send it back to my sender. Who are the people who are going to decide if my friend can send me my money back or not? Which transactions are allowed on private wise accounts, can we read it somewhere? It was 125â‚¬, I really can not believe it. We will not stop here, for sure. Because of a lot of other people who obviously have the same experience, as well as this 125â‚¬! It is not a good way of doing their activities for sure. As they have a right to keep our money, we have the right to spread our experience. A few other transactions pass without trouble, just 125â‚¬ was a very suspicious transaction! Hope it will help people to understand the "rights" we have if we decide to use Wise.\n\nStela', 'review_date': '2023-04-08', 'review_time': '14:50:08', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
