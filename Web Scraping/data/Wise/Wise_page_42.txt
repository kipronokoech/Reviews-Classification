This is not the first time I had a problem. During covid the Polish government sent funds to my account, Wise rejected them. Polish government said tough luck. Eventually, after 2 weeks of phone calls, Wise made good.\n\nThis time I am stuck in the verification proccess since October 5th. Account completely frozen with no access to a signicant amount of liquid cash.\n\nWise will respond to this review with their scripted response "We take customer verification very seriously, as we are a financial institution that needs to comply with regulations." etc etc etc. And they do have regulations to follow. But this is completely their fault for not having enough KYC specialists to handle the volume of their customers.\n\nAs part of my job I deal with AML/KYC issues, and that includes with the bank of the company I consult. We had an issue the other day, and had to provide documents. It took 5 hours not 9 days and counting like with Wise. I am so happy I didnt convince my company to switch to Wise for our FX after this experience.\n\nWhen this ordeal is over, I will not keep money in Wise. I look to use alternatives like currencyfair for FX. And I will sell all my stock because I believe this is a business flaw.\n\nUpdate 1: After 10 business days I called, and was told they rejected the document provided. That document was the filing directly from the government for my taxes. Am told provide more documents and it will be another 10 business days.\n\nUpdate 2: 18 days after freezing my account, on a Sunday the KYC team touched base. After back and forth emails I supplied Italian and Us Tax returns, past 4 personal bank statements, lettter from my client confirming our relationship, 3 past invoices, all receipts of my expenses, accounting spreadsheet. Then they deactivated my account. Sent an appeal and told 20 business days for them to respond. Still no access to my funds.', 'review_date': '2023-10-31', 'review_time': '09:18:33', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
