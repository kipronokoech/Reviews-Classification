It has forced the traditional banks to rethink their charges. Even so, the traditional banks will not get me back. I have a small criticism. When tranferring from London to Canada, one of the questions I get asked is about visiting my bank branch. I've discovered that that's the option I need to choose even though I go nowhere near the branch - I am 6000 kms away. So I choose 'visit in branch' and then do a conventional EFT. Apart from that, it's a great site.\n\nI also don't think it was necessary for you to change the name, even though I understand that you are going into banking. I used to work in marketing at a very high level and honestly; it would have been better to stay 'TransferWise'. It seems to me you were duped by expensive marketing consultants or brand advisers.
