We get it from Reuters, who update the rate in real-time during the trading market opening hours. You can read more details about it here: https://wi.se/mid-market-rate-\n\nYou can also compare it with our competitors here: https://wi.se/comparerates_\n\nAbout the fees, we get you, and we don't like the price increase either. Unfortunately, markets have been more volatile recently, which makes it more expensive for us to buy and sell currencies â€” so we need to raise our fees to cover those costs.\n\nNo need to worry, we haven't forgotten our great mission to be free. We want to make it happen, and are working hard to achieve it.\n\nWe continue to sustainably invest in our infrastructure, so you can move money faster and more conveniently. We need to reflect this in our price today, to help us bring down the cost of moving money in the future.\n\nWise", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2023-05-10', 'CompanyReplyTime': '13:12:47'}
