If it's a SWIFT payment, it usually takes 2–5 working days to reach their destination, but it is possible that they can take longer due to time differences between the sending and receiving country, or multiple intermediary banks involved with delivering your money to us.\n\nHowever, we'll always try to complete your transfer as quickly as possible.
