Change your recipient’s bank details and send your money to them again".\n- [November 3rd]: I change the details of the recipient using their application and send the transfer again (I didn\'t get a refund, I wasn\'t supposed to, they still had the money, so they were going to send it again with the right information).\n- [November 3rd]: Wise sends me an email: "USD is on its way. The money should be in the bank account by tomorrow, November 4".\n- [November 12th]: Wise sends me an email: "I’m reaching out because we need a little more information about your recent transfer due to local regulations." They ask me for "the meaning of CONCEPT-OF-THE-TRANSFER in the payment reference field". And also they ask for: "A detailed reason for your payment — what was the money being sent for?".\n- [November 12th]: I answer the email with all the information they asked for, I even attach documents to support all the information provided.\n- [November 15th]: I send an email to Wise: "I sent all the required information last Friday. Did you receive it? I didn\'t get any confirmation. It would be good to know the status of the request".\n- [November 15th]: Wise sends me an email: "We regret to inform you that COUNTRY-NAME is a restricted country to TransferWise. For that reason, your payment has been requested to be canceled and will be refunded". The reason for the transfer was to buy something in a country that apparently is forbidden to Wise (doesn\'t say anything about it on their website, they have a list of countries, but it does not include this one).\n- [November 15th]: I send them an email: "I understand. Please, refund the money to my Spanish bank account".\n- [November 18th]: I send them an email: "Hi. I would like to know how long will it take for the refund to be processed".\n- [November 21st]: I contact them using the mail form they have on their Website: "Hi! I\'ve been told that my transfer was going to be refunded, but a lot of days have already passed and I still don\'t know anything about the status of the refund".\n- [November 22nd]: They answer: "We\'ve already forwarded this issue to the relevant team, once there is any update we will let you know".\n- [November 30th]: I contact them via chat (you can do it on the app). They say: "Is it okay if I follow-up with you in an email? I will get some updates and get back to you".\n\nI\'m still waiting for my money. And, as you can see, if I don\'t contact them, they don\'t contact me. They simply don\'t care.\n\nMy recommendation? Don\'t use Wise. Obviously, they are using my money for something, and they don\'t care if I need it to save someone\'s life.\n\nI\'m taking this case to a higher level.\n\n--- UPDATE ---\n\n[December 1st]: They answer me via Twitter (I exposed my case there) "our payment\'s team has reached our banking partner".\n[December 1st]: I answer their message "I could write a long message, but the truth is that everything is already said. I demand my money back".\n[December 2nd]: I receive an email "We have not heard back from the bank involved in sending your transfer".\n[December 2nd]: I answer the email "I cannot believe I\'m receiving this answer. Incredible".\n[December 2nd]: Wise asks for more information about my transaction, through Trustpilot.\n[December 2nd]: I send them, immediatly the information the need (the same information they already have and I have provided several times via email and Twitter).\n\n--- UPDATE DECEMBER 29TH ---\nStill no refund from WISE. No useful information.

I am almost 2 weeks now without big money which is my investor's money, I cannot pay suppliers, even the 300k which was paid by my old good customer they didn't return to him yet so that we could transfer it to my other bank.

We are running a clean good business selling electronics, and they decided simply to stop that without any notice!\nKeep away from this horrible bank! I will complain to the national bank of Lithuania tomorrow about this criminal behaviour.\nThe proof that they don't care you can see here on Trustpilot, they don't even answer on person here.

Unfortunately it only went downhill after that, just 2-3 weeks later I\'m banned without proper reason.

When I press on "appeal" it sends me to a page where I\'m being shown: We have reviewed your case and decided to block. BEFORE I HAVE EVEN APPEALED.
