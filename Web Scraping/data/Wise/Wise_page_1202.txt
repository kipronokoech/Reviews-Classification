Also, I was never informed of the success (or otherwise) of the 2nd attempt. So, still work to be done by Wise on how their own system actually works.

It could be because the transfer was set up closer to the weekend/holidays, or because we needed to carry extra checks. You can read about it here: https://wi.se/howlongdoesatransfertakes\n\nSometimes the transfer bounces back, if that happens our relevant team is immediately on it to send out your transfer ASAP.\n\nWe truly appreciate your patience and understanding.\n\nWise', 'CompanyReplyDate': '2022-08-22', 'CompanyReplyTime': '12:25:43'}
