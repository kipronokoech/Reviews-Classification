Most of the time it is efficient and takes 1 to 2 days but it can get nerve wracking. Currently I have been waiting 5 days for Euro 10,000 which is way in excess of normal transfer times. My suggestions:\n1. Avoid triggering transfers on Fridays and weekends.\n2. Best to do a transfer as early as possible in the mornings of Monday to Wednesday.\n3. Avoid making transfers on and around major holiday periods and public holidays.\n\nIn fairness, difficulties are not necessarily down to Transferwise itself but the entire payment system which seems to get somewhat erratic at times.', 'review_date': '2021-01-11', 'review_time': '09:05:13', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nJan 14, 2021\nHi David,\n\nThanks for taking the time to share this information. Those are definitely helpful tips in using TransferWise the best way with payments.\n\nAbout your transfer, we agree 5 days is too long and we'd like to take a closer look into what's the reason. Please contact us via DM on Facebook or Twitter, or you can email/call here: https://wi.se/contactus_.

Other equivalent or similar servers have not been so reliable.\nIn my experience Transferwise also offers among the best rate of exchange for currency conversions.\nI would most certainly recommend Transferwise.', 'review_date': '2021-01-11', 'review_time': '08:54:26', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

Because sending to countries outside of the SEPA zone goes through the SWIFT network, there's a higher charge for it too. You'll still always get the real mid-market rate.

We're sorry to hear it didn't go well, but we're here to help.\n\nWhen we complete a transfer and it's returned to us, it's because the beneficiary bank has rejected it back. It's usually due to them not being able to clear it to the recipient's account for whatever reason. We get limited information on that so it's best for the recipient to check with their bank why that's happened.
