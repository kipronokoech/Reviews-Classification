But, something very, very strange is going on over there. For currency exchange transfers, I found Wise the fastest of the various services, even if the rates weren\'t the best. That\'s why I would usually use it for our monthly USD-CAD payroll transfers.\n\nThe problems started when we decided to start using Wise to send wire transfers in USD abroad. They keep colossal amounts of money in limbo as they\'re doing "routine checks". At the very moment, something like US$15,000 has been held for almost three weeks and I don\'t know what to tell our suppliers. It\'s horrifying. As others have mentioned, support is almost non-existent. It\'s scary, honestly... I have a gut feeling they\'re having liquidity problems based on how bad the support has gotten and how poorly the company is being run these days, and the feeling they could go up in smoke at any moment and all our transfers would be in purgatory is hard to bear. We have no choice but to go back to using our bank for USD wires and ACH transfers, until we can find another solution.\n\nLong and short of it is this - if you\'re an individual doing small transfers, Wise probably works, but once you\'re looking at completing larger, more complex transfers, Wise fails. It\'s internal communication between departments is abysmal, agents usually don\'t know what is going on (when you can talk to them), and there is no expediting team to ensure transfers are actually completing at all, let alone on time.\n\nIn the end, it\'s a bit of a nightmare lately. I would absolutely not recommend using Wise for business purposes.', 'review_date': '2022-09-14', 'review_time': '17:53:57', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nSep 15, 2022\nHi Adam,\n\nSorry to hear about your experience. We've been experiencing higher volumes than usual, so it's taking longer for us to get back to our customers. You can be sure that offering a great support for you is still our priority. As a regulated financial institution, we need to carry extra checks on transfers from time to time. If you‚Äôre sending a larger amount, we often have to do extra manual checks, which can take longer. However, we'll always try to send the money as quickly as possible.\n\n-Wise", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2022-09-15', 'CompanyReplyTime': '02:57:19'}
