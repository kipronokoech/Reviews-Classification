And the fastest way to fix this one is by cancelling the transfer yourself. You can cancel your transfer if: your transferâ€™s set up, your moneyâ€™s on its way to us, or your moneyâ€™s being processed â€“ weâ€™ll send the money back to you, and you can set up another transfer using the correct bank details.\n\nOnce we send out the money, if the recipientâ€™s details are wrong, their bank will usually reject it and send the money back to us. Weâ€™ll get in touch with you if this happens to ask whether youâ€™d like to update the details and send it again, or cancel the transfer and get a refund.\n\nIf the transfer appears as completed, the money is out of Wiseâ€™s system and into the banking system. You'll need to get in touch with the recipient, and ask them to contact their bank and find out whether the money can still be delivered, or whether their bank will send it back to Wise.\n\nWe do offer support via various channels, such as phone, email and social media. You can find our info here: https://wi.se/contactus, or reach out to us on Twitter, Facebook, or Instagram. Just provide us with your email and user number, and we'll be happy to help you.\n\nDo keep in mind that we aim to reply to all emails within 2 working days, and in social media within 2 hours.

The person from Wise also informed me , that if we don\'t comply\nWise will "send back" out money ... Since the email from Wise employee was written in Polish (probably translated via "google translate or simlar software")\nand the person wasn\'t Polish, I asked for clarification of what they meant by saying "send back our money". Never got a reply to this email so far, so I filed a complaint in which I also asked for clarification of what they meant by saying Wise would send back our company money, as this would obviously cause us to face serious financial loss ...\nAlso I asked for a proper law paragraph based on which they demand to put my personal details onto our company "contact section", informing Wise I would not comply unless they provide me with this information\n\n\nI never got a reply to my email, but instead on 11/08 I received another email from Wise,this time anonymously signed from "Wise Team" saying that our company is not fit any longer for Wise,\nas it breaches Wise\'s T&C by offering trips to shooting ranges and lap dance club entries. Obviously they way the worded it sounded like we were trading guns on black market and offering prostitution. Funny enough, they didn\'t consider our services "unethical" for many years, until I dared to ask them for clarification of their demands and threats...\n\nFollowing this email, I decided to move our money from Wise, as they called us to do so, before they close our account in a "month time" (and yes, this is the exact wording they used- \'in a month time" without even taking some effort to let us know whether they consider a month 30 days or 31 days !)\nUp to my surprise, when I tried to send the money to a different bank account of ours, Wise blocked the transfer informing me that "someone from their team is personally checking us now and the issue should be resolved within 24hrs". So I waited 24hrs and then got information that they are sorry, but it will take longer, and that I should be available by email, because they might need to contact me with regards to us moving our money from our account...\n\nOn 18/08 I received another email saying that they understand that closing our account is surely a sad situation for us. A person who addressed me this time said he\\she would check with the other department and let me know the exact date on which they will close the account. However no reply with regards to m=our company money being frozen, despite that the other department urged us to transfer the money from the account before they close the account. So time is running out, I am trying to fulfil our obligations to move the money from the account as requested by Wise, but Wise is blocking our money, so I can\'t !\n\nI\'m in the point where I\'m really stressed, as I\'m leaving on holidays tomorrow till mid September, and won\'t have access to company emails...\nNot to mention that I had to use my personal funds to pay for the company costs and salaries, since I can\'t use company money, since Wise is now deliberately blocking it.\n\nTo call this a mess would be a huge compliment to Wise, so please mark my words and be wise by STAYING AWAY FROM WISE', 'review_date': '2023-08-19', 'review_time': '12:38:34', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nAug 21, 2023\nHi Dawid,\n\nAs a regulated financial institution, we'd never close an account without a reason.
