We don't take it lightly but we hope we can give some insight. When we close an account, we can't share the specific reason why due to how we're regulated but some possible reasons range from compromised security, duplicate accounts or a discrepancy with a financial law. https://wi.se/accountdeactivation\n\nIf you feel we've made any mistakes you can appeal the decision to close your account. We have a dedicated appeals team that assists you with this as well as helps process any remaining balance refunds after completing due diligence checks. You can get in touch with them here: https://wi.se/appeal .\n\nRegards,\nThe TransferWise Team", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2021-01-27', 'CompanyReplyTime': '17:29:37'}
