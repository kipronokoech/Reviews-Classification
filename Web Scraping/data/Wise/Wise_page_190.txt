Just try to move funds from a "personnel" account to a business - and the business/charity box is not available (greyed out). How maddening!!!! Your crazy site can only move funds to a person in China and then only pay via WeChat or two other options but not to a business bank account. I have contacted my bank and told them never to refer anyone to Wise - it is a useless time waster. I even tried to pretend that I was actually a business, which in turn does have open (and NOT greyed out) the option to move funds to a business/chairty, and then it wanted my business license or cert. of incorporation. Perfectly worthless site. Please delete my account here and all personal data passport images, bank account data etc. XE worked like a charm....I have actually already paid a business in China and will use them going forward.
