Two things have bothered me: when the headquarters were moved from Frankfurt to Brussels there was a one-off glitch with my transfer and I was unable to contact anybody. Not having been alerted to this move (you should have done this to all your regular customers: always keeping them informed should be a number one priority), I spent many anxious hours wondering if this company had gone out of business, with the distinct possibility that all my money might have been irrevocably lost.\nSecond, I think the change of name is mistaken and misguided. Whoever had this crazy idea? The whole point of a brand name is that you associate the product with the name. Transferwise made this abundantly clear. Wise does not. You could just as easily be a relationships or marriage guidance counselling service, a club for people with a high IQ or an investment fund. I did think of giving you only three stars because of this ridiculous management decision.\nHowever, my annoyance is offset by the knowledge that any transfer is effected very promptly with money credited to the account in question the very same day. That is really a superb service.', 'review_date': '2021-10-22', 'review_time': '15:05:48', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
