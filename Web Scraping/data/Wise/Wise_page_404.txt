When you try and call in the customer service line says you need to make a complaint online, when you look online it says to call in. So you go around in a loop, totally useless. I have used Stripe for years so it is a shame I cannot use Wise due to the lower fees, however it seems that my custom is not welcome.', 'review_date': '2023-04-10', 'review_time': '11:57:33', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

We work with the same type of bank in Singapore and we never had such issue before, all compliance questions resolved within a few days. I was trying to ask the bank if they have any questions? They do not, but still not process the transfers. This is very disappointed and degrades our company\'s trust with our partners.

Which is bad when economy is ever changing and you send the money on a good day and it bounces back when currency is worth less.\n\nBad I’ll anyone thinking of joining, trust me save the hassle and go starling.
