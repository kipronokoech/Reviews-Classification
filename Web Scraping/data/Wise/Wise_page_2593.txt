At a time where I had customs across the US, UK and other countries, Wise offered a simple solution to dealing with multiple currencies in a super cost effective way. Not only that, as someone who designs app and appreciates good customer experience, Wise have built something really special. The user experience is simple and their customer support is fantastic. On the two occasions I needed to ask for support, my questions were dealt with quickly and efficiently, both telephonically and via the chat function.\n\nI still use Wise every day for my personal and business needs, to keep my complexity low and also that of my customers.
