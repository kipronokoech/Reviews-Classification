It's often a result of a conflict with our Terms of Service or Customer Agreement, or due to a discrepancy with a financial law. We can't always share the exact reason for the deactivation, due to how we're regulated.\n\nIf you think weâ€™ve made a mistake, you can follow these guidelines to appeal our decision: https://wi.se/accountdeactivation. Weâ€™ll review your request and get back to you ASAP via email.\n\nIf you still have money in your account, we'll work on sending it back to you. But first, we need to carry out due diligence checks. While we do that, your money and information stays safe and secure.\n\nWise", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2023-10-09', 'CompanyReplyTime': '11:05:46'}
