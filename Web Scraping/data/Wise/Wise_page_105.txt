I have never used Wise services before but recently created an account to make an international money transfer. The online transfer process went smoothly and I received confirmation that the transfer was in progress. But when I went to check on the transfer the following morning, I was greeted with a message on the login page that my account was deactivated. Underneath it was a link to appeal the deactivation. When I clicked on it, I was told in so many words that upon reviewing my case they have decided to close my account. This was a simple money transfer from my personal bank account (USA) to a friend\'s account (Bangladesh). I took pains to ensure that the recipient\'s bank information was accurate. I never received any emails from Wise regarding any potential problem. When I tried to contact them using their "Contact Us" link, I was simply redirected to the login page, which of course was useless. I logged a complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. We\'ll see if I ever get an explanation from Wise. The hubris and indifference of this company are mindboggling.\n\nAddendum: Talked to my financial institution.
