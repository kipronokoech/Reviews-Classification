I’m a very grateful and happy customer. The freedom gained with all the options available when using Wise accounts is remarkable. I feel safe, I feel cared for. The fees charged are so small. I trust Wise. These are indeed a kind crew of founders here, no wonder it’s called Wise. Kindness is wisdom and I feel these two characteristics for the first time in the world of banking. I received a large sum from an American company I worked for remotely into my US dollar account (I have several currency accounts open with Wise), and it went superbly well. Zero glitches. I also have used my card at several stores in Europe and have withdrawn cash from ATMs. Really happy with this operation.

We're working towards a free to use product, but we haven't reached this goal just yet. Until then, we'll always disclose our fees before you pay for your transfer and we keep our pricing as transparent (and low) as possible.\n\nAll the best,\nWise Team.", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2021-06-14', 'CompanyReplyTime': '09:19:33'}
