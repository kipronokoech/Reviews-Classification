I explained that my father had no Will and the estate was small. I was the next of kin, there was no property involved, my solicitor said there was no need to apply for probate as the amounts in banks where below their thresholds and I was or had notified everyone. Sure enough I closed my fathers bank accounts and paid his debts. Transferwise however have been horrendous at dealing with this situation, some 10 emails and 7 phone calls at least later and over a month, and they still have not transferred the balance. They have had the death certificate, my birth certificate, my driving licence, and a closing bank statement for my fathers account from the bank, proving I have been dealing with the bank and my details are on. They insist on a letter of probate. I explained I am not applying for probate just for Transferwise. If I pay a solicitor to apply for it, it will cost around £1500 and take approx 3 months.\n\nTransferWise have had more info proving who I am than I would need to apply for probate or a passport, and they are the only company refusing to accept what I have provided because of their process, which seems to be tailored for those with thousands in accounts therefore banks etc would not release funds. They have no bereavement team so I go via  tech support whom I have to repeat everything to each time I call. I am completely disheartened and beside myself with how they have handled everything...I guess they have won as I am not paying out to get less back than I would pay.
