Unfortunately the service and customer service has fallen into the toilet.\nTransfers that used to take 1 to 2 days, now take 6 days. A call to customer service used to be answered immediately, now you wait on hold for a minimum of half an hour (and believe me I have done it 4 times in the last two days). I was told by an agent to cancel as slow transfer (was going to take 6 days) and try again and "perhaps" it would go into a faster bucket.\nNot only was the new transaction still going to take 6 days, but they drafted BOTH the new and the cancelled transaction from my bank account, and now say I have to wait 6 days for a REFUND!! $15000, and WHO has that money for 6 days???\nTransferwise USED to be one of my favorite companies. Easy, Fast, Competant.\nNow all I can say is RUN do not walk from this company.

Moving money worldwide should be fast. Next to speed, our priority is keeping your money and our platform safe. So we carry out routine checks from time to time.\n\nIf your transfer is taking a little longer, don’t worry. We’ll get in touch if we need more info from you. Just keep an eye on your email — including your spam inbox — for any messages from us. And you can check your transfer progress under “Activity” in your account.\n\nOnce we're done with the checks, your money will be flying again.\n\nIf you'd like to us to check your case, please contact us at: https://wi.se/contactus, or on X (Twitter), Facebook, and Instagram.
