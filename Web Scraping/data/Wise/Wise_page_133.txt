We're constantly working to improve our communication processes to ensure consistency and accuracy.\n\nRegarding the situation where you accidentally sent money to the incorrect bank details, we understand how stressful this can be. Our conversion process is designed to be fast and efficient, which means cancellations aren't possible once the transfer is marked as complete. However, in such cases, we recommend reaching out to the recipient and explaining the situation. They can contact their bank to explore the possibility of redirecting the funds or returning them to Wise.\n\nFor transactions involving unsupported currencies, we do offer alternative solutions, such as payments via SWIFT: https://wi.se/swiftpayments. However, we'd need to take a closer look at your case to better advise you.\n\nPlease reach out to us directly through our contact page: https://wi.se/contactus. Alternatively, you can also connect with us on social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram by providing your email and user number.\n\nWise", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2023-08-16', 'CompanyReplyTime': '10:55:41'}

It appears that they possess the authority to arbitrarily suspend your account at their discretion, without deeming it necessary to provide a cogent rationale for their actions. The communication I received read\n“We have closed your account because how you use, or plan to use Wise, isn‘t allowed under our Acceptable Use Policy”\nUpon seeking clarification and elaboration, the response furnished was rather puzzling: “Unfortunately, we can’t tell you the specific reason why we’ve closed your account— it’s because of how we’re regulated”\nI\'m quite surprised that they\'re saying my future plans to use the account are suspicious enough to close it down. It makes me wonder if this is like a "thoughtcrime."\nI wouldn\'t recommend anyone to entrust their money in the hands of these folks.\n\nUPDATE:\nIt\'s evident that Wise team haven\'t put in the effort to create a believable explanation. Instead, they\'ve resorted to their typical formulaic and cynical reply: "Blah-blah-blah, there\'s always a reason for account closures, though we won\'t disclose it. Feel free to appeal and give us a good laugh."\nTheir message essentially implies: \'We are not inclined to put in the effort to demonstrate how and when you\'ve violated the rules. Instead, the burden is on you to prove that you haven\'t. If you\'re unable to do so, it suggests that you have indeed violated the rules.\' Needless to say, demonstrating the absence of something is generally unfeasible.', 'review_date': '2023-08-15', 'review_time': '18:20:50', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nAug 14, 2023\nHi Sergey,\n\nWe understand having your account closed is frustrating, but rest assured this is never done without a reason.
