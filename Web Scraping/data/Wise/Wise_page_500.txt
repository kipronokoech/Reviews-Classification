I really enjoyed it for 8 months (very poor client support but this fact didn't affect me till the moment) and suddenly i was informed that my acc is closed. I didn't violenced any rules, didn't use p2p, didn't transit money - just got money from my account in a traditional bank, converted it and partially sent them to another my personal bank account and partially - spent by wise-card. I spent about 15 thousand euros for 8 months - not more. But nobody told me what was wrong, nobody asked me for any documents and nobody explained me what was the reason. I am really sad of getting no more possibility to use wise and personally offended by not-getting even a single-word explanation of what happened. But still - those who still can use Wise - you're lucky))", 'review_date': '2023-02-03', 'review_time': '15:21:39', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

I am a diplomat by the way, hence I am traveling a lot and wanted a better and cheaper way to exchange currency based to where I am posted around the world.\n\nAt some point mid to late last year (2022), I started having problems where my account was frozen and they were requesting an insane amount of paperwork in order to verify where my wealth is coming from.\n\nAll this due to “regulations” in the countries they operate within. This is, unfortunately for us, blatantly BS (and yes, before you even ask, this is as diplomatically and kids-friendly as I could put it. You get the drift...). Since Wise doesn’t have any physical appearance, i.e. branches or ATM’s anywhere in the world, no one can get a sum of cash and deposit it to his/her Wise account. This means that all transactions are coming from actual banks that DO regulate everything, including reporting to the competent local authorities all transaction larger to 10.000 Euros or USD etc.\n\nTherefore Wise shouldn’t need ANY paperwork from our part to verify our wealth, because this isn’t their job, nor they have a need to know. Further to the point above, here is an extract from their website:\n\n“Can you wire transfer $500,000?\nThere aren’t any laws on sending money abroad which stipulate maximum wire transfer amounts. So, you can send an international wire of as much as you like, provided that it’s within the maximum wire transfer limits set by your bank.”\n\nSo our bank sets the limits and, by the process of elimination, Wise shouldn’t, but they actually do.\n\nNow they are asking for my last tax report, among other things they asked in the past. I believe it’s not their business to know how much money I make therefore I won’t send them the data and subsequently I will lose whatever I have stored in my wise account. Thankfully it’s not that much.\n\nMy advice to you based on my experience with this company is to stay away; Far away! There are others that do what Wise does and I am pretty sure your experience can’t be as bad. In any case, before you commit, read the *customer* reviews first.\n\nTake care and stay safe everyone.', 'review_date': '2023-02-03', 'review_time': '12:33:48', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nFeb 8, 2023\nHello,\n\nWe're sorry to hear that you haven't had the best experience with us, Nicholas.
