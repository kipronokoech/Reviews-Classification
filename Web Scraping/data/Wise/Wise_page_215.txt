Just a bit annoying.\n\nWell, the problem starts when you send those documents, on the first try, not approved. No problem, I tried again, sending all documents I had for the period of 6 months, not approved again.\n\nThen they request one more time, but well the link I\'m supposed to use to upload those documents doesn\'t work...\n\nMeanwhile, my recent transfer (the one that triggered this review process) is cancelled and their customer support ask me to have patience because their review process can take up to 14 days.\n\nImagine Wise is your main business bank account and you can\'t make any transfers for 14 days, this is unacceptable, but even worse when waiting two weeks is not enough and they\'re not able to solve this simple problem.\n\nSeriously, one of the worst treatments I got from a business in a long time. Such a pity because I really used to like Wise, well that was until they started to treat me like dirt and demand that I prove where my money comes from, and even when I do so their review system is so broken that even when I proved all the documents they could ever need they\'re not able to put 1 and 2 together.\n\nPitful.', 'review_date': '2023-06-28', 'review_time': '13:40:04', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
