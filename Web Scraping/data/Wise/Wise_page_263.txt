Their claim of expedited services, in reality, has proven to be misleading, as it can take up to an agonizing two working days for a transaction to be processed.\n\nIn the bustling sphere of modern business, waiting for two working days for financial transactions is, frankly, intolerable. When rival services accomplish the same in merely a few hours, it is puzzling why Wise cannot live up to this industry standard. This not only causes inconvenience but can also create substantial disruption to smooth business operations.\n\nMoreover, my experience with their customer service has been decidedly subpar. This was highlighted by an incident this morning when I had the misfortune of interacting with a customer service representative who had an unacceptable attitude. The call was challenging from the start. It sounded as if she was whispering in a room teeming with loud chatter, making it impossible for me to hear or understand her. To add insult to injury, she abruptly ended the call, providing a stark example of poor customer service.\n\nFor businesses like mine, time translates to money. Wise's sluggish transfer speed coupled with poor customer service is a costly combination, resulting in both wasted time and potential financial loss.\n\nWhile I recognize the complexities inherent in providing financial services and facilitating transfers, other providers in this industry have demonstrated that swift and efficient service is achievable. Regrettably, Wise feels more like the slow lane in an industry that is rapidly accelerating on the highway of progress.\n\nGiven these experiences, I find it difficult to recommend Wise to businesses that value time, efficiency, and respectful interaction. There are countless other financial service providers offering faster and more reliable services, with customer service that respects and values its clients.\n\nFrom my viewpoint, Wise should consider its name and seriously reconsider its service strategies, both in terms of transaction processing and customer interaction, if it wishes to remain competitive in this fast-paced industry.", 'review_date': '2023-06-07', 'review_time': '10:12:45', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nJul 4, 2023\nHey there,\n\nWe always work on moving your money as fast as possible, but every transfer is unique, and not all of them are instant.
