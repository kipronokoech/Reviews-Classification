This isn't something we take lightly. It's normally a result of a conflict with our Terms of Service or Customer Agreement, or due to a discrepancy with a financial law. We can't share the exact reason of the deactivation, due to how we're regulated. However, you can find some possible reasons here wi.se/accountdeactivation.\n\nIf you're not happy with this decision, you can appeal here https://wi.se/-appeal, and our appeals team will reach out to you once they have further updates regarding your account. Please keep in mind that this process might take up to 30 working days.\n\nAs for your remaining money in your account, we'll work on sending it back to you. But first, we need to carry out due diligence checks. While we do that, your money and information will be safe and secure.\n\nWise", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2023-01-30', 'CompanyReplyTime': '13:38:24'}
