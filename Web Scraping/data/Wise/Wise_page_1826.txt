Transfers are fast and reliable without surprises and this is really their strong point. I have had many problems or unexpected fees, delays with international transfers with other providers, for various reasons, but never had a single issue with Transferwise. However one downside is that they only do transfers in a currency to the countries that use that currency officially... meaning you cannot send CHF to the eurozone for example.\nAlso the card works very well.\nThe only slight negative is that the fees are always changing, making the fee structure a bit difficult to follow. They go up, go down, depending on the currency you're using or the way the wind blows.... usually the changes are not huge but can still be significant enough.\nSo if there's one thing they could do better, is to stick to a stable and transparent fee structure over a long period (not months, but years, ideally decades...)", 'review_date': '2022-04-29', 'review_time': '15:57:16', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
