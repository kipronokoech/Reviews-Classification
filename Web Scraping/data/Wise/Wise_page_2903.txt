This is after an initial check that require passport verification. Unfortunately the delays at Wise meant rent for my daughter’s apartment did not arrive on time and we also had to go with another money transfer service. I understand the important of making the regulatory checks and avoiding fraud, however I have been with my US bank for over 40 years and once I transferred the funds to Wise, Wise did not connect with my US bank for days. If Wise wants to grow you will need to find more effective ways to verify the information you need as 2 to 4 days when funds are instantly accessible directly from a checking account that you have already verified is unacceptable. Two transactions out of maybe 10 tries went through in seconds and that service was excellent. The balance of the transactions and the limited 9 to 5 customer service who really could provide no additional information than what we saw on the app and their standard scripted response was not helpful. There are opportunities for Wise to improve and saying you can transfer funds in seconds in my view is inaccurate.

At the beginning of the year I sent small sums to Brasil and all went well. I was encouraged to use Wise to make larger transfers by e-mail. In the process of making transfers I discovered that your attention to your customers is abysmal and your partner bank in Brasil takes advantage of the regulations to sit on the money for as long as possible, in order to earn interest for themselves. I also discovered that it is company policy not to reply to requests for information unless you have something new to say. This is all well and good (for you) but I spent from Friday until Monday night wondering if my money had been stolen because Vini did not have the good manners to send me a reply. Please fire him. The only way that I was finally able to conclude the transactions (on two occassions), when the deadline had passed, was to phone you and give some unfortunate victim a WEAPONS-GRADE BOLLOCKING! Only then did someone get their finger out and sort the situation out. I hate dealing with banks and other financial institutions for this very reason. It seems that the only way to get some kind of service is to be completely obnoxious. You may be assured that I will be looking for alternative means to make future transfers that do not involve such huge delay and consequent stress. In the meantime I reflect that at least I have got what I needed and will now be able to go back to my pleasant and tranquil existance, while you continue to spend your miserable lives dealing with this crap.\nYour reply is laughable. Typically, it took ages to arrive and just says that you will carry on in the same mode because you think your business model is fine. If you speak to the people that have to answer your phones then I think you will find that they are tired of having to deal with irate customers who are getting a snail-paced service from the rest of your company. If you have any interest in the well-being of these employees, and their stress levels, then I suggest that you take urgent action to improve your communication with clients.
