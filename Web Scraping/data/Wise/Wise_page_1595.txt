Is it the least expensive we're found? Yes. But it hurts.

Some of our fees have reduced for certain currencies, and some have gone up due to different factors.\n\nSWIFT fees aren't under our control, unfortunately, but we're working on offering everyone a fixed fee, so there wouldn't be any surprise charges. Mostly, the extra fees come from intermediary banks that handle the money as well, but we explain it a bit more here: https://wi.se/swiftpayments_\n\nHope this clarifies a bit more!\nWise team.", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2022-06-13', 'CompanyReplyTime': '10:27:57'}
