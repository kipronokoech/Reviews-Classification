{'platform': 'Wise', 'id': '610e1670f9f48709d4ca7cb3', 'stars': 1, 'title': 'Wise is scam', 'message': 'Guys, if you really wanna use Wise to transfer your money into different currency. You need to take risk that it would not send instantly sometimes, it might takes a week or few months. And, if they suspect that you doing anything against their T&C policy, they will hold and freeze your fund and account. Contact Support cannot solve any problem, they will say CS has no accessible information about the cases. You cannot cancel those pending transaction because they wanna hold your money and go for certain checks and it always takes more than a month. Once your account deactivated or they no longer offer you their service, those pending transaction will take few months to refund to your bank account or never refund to you. The customer support will always tell you they can‚Äôt give a deadline of the refund period, a lot of excuse. Wise‚Äôs customer support is the worst in the world I guess, they not treat all customer in the same way. When you call UK cs they ans A, when you call Aus cs they ans B and so on. So at the end you are wasting your time and no getting any accurate answer from them. Email they would not reply you few weeks if your transaction are getting some checks by their certain team, even though you submit all documents they ask for, they won‚Äôt reply you until they have update. This situation they cannot give you a time limit, sometimes it means will take forever because they say ‚Äúonce update‚Äù. What if few months no update? A year not getting update? Your money inside Wise will become their money already. What you can do? You can‚Äôt do anything, unless you wanna hire a lawyer against them but it would cost higher. Do all research before you use Wise, read their T&C before do the transaction for any purpose. My account now was deactivated by them, I have no idea when they will refund and also you may take a look on those who got deactivated their not getting back their money, you may search it on Google. A lot victims are there. Thank you for your time to read it, I really don‚Äôt want to see any victims again.', 'review_date': '2021-08-07', 'review_time': '05:13:20', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nAug 11, 2021\nHello, Sherry.\n\nWe understand it's frustrating when your transfer takes longer than expected, but as a regulated financial institution, we need to carry extra checks on your payment. Because of compliance reasons, it isn't always possible to share the exact details about it. Those checks will usually take 2 - 4 working days. If there is a delay, it'll never exceed 10 working days. We don't carry checks for months or years, and we always make sure to keep customers updated along the way.\n\nDeactivation can happen for a few reasons, but because of the way we're regulated, we can't share with you the exact reason why. Rest assured, this is only ever done due to conflicts with our Terms of Use.\n\nWe share more information here: https://wi.se/accountdeactivation_.\n\nAll the best,\nWise Team.", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2021-08-11', 'CompanyReplyTime': '11:40:57'}
