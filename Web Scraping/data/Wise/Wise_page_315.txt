No chat available either.\n\nI do understand that the verification might take a while but from all 3 transactions 1 was approved after 2 days and two where still handing, one of them was just adding money from my account.

We ever only close accounts that are being used in a way that goes against our Terms of Use: https://wise.com/terms-and-conditions\n\nIf you think a mistake was made, you can appeal our decision following the guidelines here: https://wi.se/accountdeactivation_ We’ll review your request and get back to you ASAP via email.

Once these checks are completed, we always get in touch about the refund.\n\nDue diligence checks are conducted to verify the information you have provided to us. We are required to do these at all stages of the customer relationship, not just during the initial onboarding stage, so this means during the customer relationship as well as during the deactivation stage.\n\nWise', 'CompanyReplyDate': '2023-05-19', 'CompanyReplyTime': '07:27:29'}

We appreciate your feedback, and we'd like to address your concerns.\n\nYou're absolutely right that sending money shouldn't cost a fortune, and we're fully committed to making it affordable for everyone. While we're not quite there yet, we're constantly working hard to make it happen.

You'll always see the fee upfront, and you'll only pay for what you use. Our aim is to provide a cost-effective solution for your money transfers.\n\nRegarding the speed of transfers, we strive to complete them as quickly as possible. However, there are instances where delays can happen due to various reasons. It could be because the transfer was initiated closer to the weekend or during holidays, or sometimes we may need to conduct additional checks for security purposes.
