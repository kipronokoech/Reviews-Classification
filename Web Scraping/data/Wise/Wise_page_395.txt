This may have been prudent, no complaints here. My personal account was also deactivated though I was not aware of this until I tried to use it a week or so later.\n\nFor 3 weeks all f/x balances held with Wise were blocked causing enormous liquidity issues for my business. This despite providing Wise with all the information they required to effect a return.\n\nOnly after filing a complaint with the Financial Ombudsman Service were the funds finally returned to the business (with a loss on f/x rates in the process).\n\nOnce it started, the whole return process and verification took about 20 minutes on the phone, part of that time due to my insistence that Wise prove they were Wise when they called. Verification is a two way street.\n\n- Why was the return not completed within a few days after deactivation when all verification data was on hand?\n\n-Why was proactive communication from Wise virtually non-existent besides informing me of terminating the accounts?\n\n-Why did it take so long to return funds despite providing all information and verification (electronically) that was requested?\n\n-Why was there no interest at all to create new accounts with Wise to continue the business relationship we had?\n\nI spoke with 8 different people during this period of uncertainty and had to repeat everything and allow time to go through the ever lengthening email chain on the subject. A very frustrating process.\n\nI\'ve been a loyal Wise customer for many years for business purposes and on a personal basis as well. I even let many know just how good their service was and quite a few began to use Wise.\n\nBetter communication from Wise would have gone a long way to more patience and understanding on my part but not 3 weeks.\n\nFor a business not to have access to liquidity for 3 weeks is literally a matter of life and death. It was a very difficult time for myself and the business. All savings I made using Wise over the years were completely wiped out and more than reversed. Hard to believe that it would have been better to use traditional, more expensive, and slower & poorer banking services over the years.\n\nWise needs to up its game particularly in cases were accounts are deactivated for reasons similar to my own. Holding funds after deactivation for 3 or more weeks is unethical at best, particularly where all information is provided to effect a return of these. Furthermore, once accounts are deactivated and blocked, there is no way to access them to review balances, accounts, membership information, or any information of any kind which makes the verification process very difficult.\n\nAlso, after account deactivation, customer service access is limited and it is VERY difficult to find out where to contact Wise and phone numbers are not readily available.\n\nI really cannot recommend Wise to any business or individual until these issues are resolved and their customer service portal is significantly improved.\n\nBefore any business considers using Wise, I suggest reviewing their business T&Cs as there are a number of clauses are likely not acceptable from a Risk Management perspective and certainly not from a service provider (Wise) that is potentially managing significant amounts of your (company\'s) cash and liquidity. They did try to hold these against my business with no option for redress and no clarification what the issues were.\n\nIf you are using Wise regardless, please be sure that you hold regular offline statements of account for your records (I thankfully did) and keep balances to a minimum even if it results in f/x losses. If your complaints are not answered and managed quickly, go to the Financial Ombudsman sooner rather than later.\n\nIt seems I am not alone in my experience which is very sad to see.\n\nIn my case, all goodwill and trust in Wise built over many years is permanently gone.', 'review_date': '2023-04-14', 'review_time': '13:57:04', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
