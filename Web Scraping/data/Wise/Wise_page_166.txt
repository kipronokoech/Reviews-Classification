But I don’t like being nickel and dimed at every step of a transaction or even just a simple transaction. For example, topping up from my US bank account today, there was a $.65 fee and then another $2.44 fee to convert dollars to euros etc..\nI just did a comparison with Revolut, which I’ve had also for a long time, and I am getting, in spite of their fees (which are new for my account), a slightly better deal when I’m topping up, converting usd to euros and sending to an account within Europe. I would much rather that Wise charge a monthly fee for some accounts in lieu of fees at almost every step of such a transaction. Having said that, I still use Wise because I trust this company with my money, and I like that I can attach photos of the receipts and notes. (I don’t trust Revolut or N26 much, and I’ve had a lot of problems with Revolut. I think their customer service is terrible and I was paying for the highest tier with priority service).
