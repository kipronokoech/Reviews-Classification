You decide which currency accounts you want (you can add extra at any time with ease), not all currencies are available but these countries normally use dollars anyways.\n\nAdding money to your account is very easy. Two methods cost nothing and in my opinion are the easier methods anyway. Select how much you want to add, from what account and it will ask if you want to manually transfer the money. This method they will provide all the details and reference number you need to use OR (the much easier way) select the account and get it approved. This method automatically opens the selected bank for authorisation. Boom moneys in your account both ways pretty much instantly.\n\nConvert money between accounts takes seconds also. Select the account that you want money to be converted FROM, select what currency and how much you want to convert. They covert at a much higher rate than exchanges (normally Google exchange rate) and the fee is very reasonable. Once you agree then instantly the money is converted and moved into the relevant account.\n\nI would say the only downside is that you can’t use the card to purchase in a selected currency it is always in your native currency.
