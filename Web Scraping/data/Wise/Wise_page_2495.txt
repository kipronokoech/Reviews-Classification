Because of that, you need to make sure these details are correct. Some banks will carry name checks, and the payment can't be received unless there is a match. However, once the payment is sent out from our side, we can't recall it or reserve it. In case of incorrect details, the recipient's bank will need to reject the payment and sent back to us. This is a process we can't speed up from our side, nor we're able to share updates in between. You'll be reached by email once your money is sent back. Then, you'll be able to cancel the transfer and get a refund.\n\nWise.", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2021-12-02', 'CompanyReplyTime': '09:24:21'}
