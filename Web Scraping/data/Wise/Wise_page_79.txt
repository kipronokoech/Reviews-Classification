We have been business customers of Wise for 3 years and sent thousands of transfers with their service over this period. The most recent of which was a transfer of 11,000‚Ç¨ was sent to an account that had been closed down (unknown to ourselves) As with any bank that is no longer open, the transfer would usually be returned back within a week however this is NOT THE SAME WITH WISE.\n\nAll documents requested have been provided showing that the recipients bank has never received it and after over a MONTH we still are nowhere closer to getting the money back. Each time we call they request a new document which we then provide and they still cannot locate this money. This has now ruined relationships between ourselves and clients and has meant that we are having to send the money from our personal account for their mistake.\n\nThey are saying they cannot trace it and could not care less when speaking to their support. I am on the phone with them at least 2 times a day and they are extremely unhelpful and blas√© about the whole situation. As soon as we get our money refunded we will be closing down our account.\n\n\nDO NOT USE THIS BANK.', 'review_date': '2023-09-20', 'review_time': '16:50:19', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

It ended up terribly wrong. I was told by Wise that my account will be closed and my money will be refunded within 5 business days. I started to wait. After the time has passed I wrote to their support a request asking when will my money come. I didn't receive a response. I wrote a bad review on Truspilot and the same day I received a message from Wise, saying that if I need to send them some request so they overlook their decisions. I didn't want Wise to reopen my account. All I need was my money!! Which I replied to them in the email, yet I have recieve no response. It's been more than 20 days since my money missing and I haven't received any reasonable help or explanations on how I can get my money back! Instead couple days ago I got an email that looked like a Joke. Wise asked me if I satisfied with the services of their customer support!! I want to make it very clear If I not receive my money by the end of the month, I will go to police and report froudery on Wise for stealing my money.

AFTER you pay the fee, you are met with a screen asking you to verify your identity using a multitude of methods for your chosen country (drivers license, passport, etc) but after you select your method of proving your identity (it does not matter which method you choose, all lead to the same issue) and take a photo, it remains "uploading" forever. I left my phone overnight on this screen, by the time I woke up in the morning it said the same. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app, I have tried turning my phone on and off, I tried other phones, other internet networks, I\'ve tried everything you could think of and nothing worked. I have seen hundreds of reviews by now on various websites such as google play store reviews, trustpilot, productreview, on their instagram and twitter, and basically anywhere you can think of all mentioning the same problem.\n\nI decided to email support with a clear and detailed explanation of the problem in a polite manner, after a week, I got a response that was nonsense stating instructions on how to verify, what methods of identification they accept and that if I had any problems to try what I have already tried (reinstalling the app, etc) - ignoring the problems I was having.\n\nI responded to them with the exact kinds of phones I had used to try, with the software version, and the app version I was using and re-described the exact issue with them again where the app is stuck "uploading" with no error messages, its just that nothing happens.\n\nThey responded again by suggesting to reinstall the app, which I already stated in my original email I had done, and told them in the previous email where I responded to them that I had already done this. They also suggested trying an internet browser on a computer, but its not possible to complete this verification process on a computer since it reroutes you back to your phone via email link or qr code to finish the process, which again - The app did not work. I informed them of this in my new reply.\n\nThey then responded by asking me for a screenshot of an error message, or a screenshot of the problem in the app and that they "will be attentive if help is needed".\n\nI responded letting them know once again that there was no error message, and that if I were to take a screenshot I would just be screenshotting a camera screen of my passport or drivers license with the word "uploading" overlaid on the top (since they had stated elsewhere never to send pictures of your documents by email).\n\nThe next day, I had not response from support but rather my account was closed, and they have kept the money I paid to open the account. I have not heard anything from them since, and I do not know how I am supposed to receive funds from prop trading firms which have wise as their only option.\n\nFurther reading into wise seems to suggest wise may not be somewhere you should entrust money to, whatever the purpose. It would be unwise.', 'review_date': '2023-09-20', 'review_time': '08:59:29', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
