We're not there just yet, but we work hard to make it happen. We always charge as little as possible: right now a tiny fee, eventually free.\n\nThat's not all – we know that sometimes the rate can just to be too good to be true, but who has time to check it all the time.\nNo worries, Auto Conversions allows you to pick your desired exchange rate and a specified amount to convert between two eligible currencies. We’ll watch the rate for you, and convert your money automatically when your desired rate – or an even better rate – is met in the market.

It is obvious that business account holders are subjected to a greater number of requirements and regulations compared to their personal counterparts. The recent verification process has proven to be a nightmare, not solely because the accompanying technical issues and bugs, but primarily due to the inexpert and uncooperative nature of their customer service team. Initially, they provided false information about the status of my verification, and now they have chosen to ignore my e-mails altogether. Meanwhile, my business account, an essential tool for daily operations, remains inaccessible. I strongly advise using Wise ONLY for personal purposes, where interactions with the customer service are infrequent and the potential for disruptions is minimal.
