It could be because the transfer was set up closer to the weekend/holidays, or because we needed to carry extra checks.

Despite being a long-time user of their services, I have been met with an unwavering and unsympathetic response to my account closure.\n\nWhen I reached out to reactivate my account and explained my need for banking details to receive important payments, including affiliate balances, office bills, and client bills, Wise failed to provide any viable solution. Their decision appears to be final, without any consideration of my situation.\n\nIt is disheartening to see a company that I once trusted exhibit such a lack of empathy and support for its customers. Throughout my time as a Wise user, I have consistently adhered to their terms and never engaged in any inappropriate behavior. Yet, my loyalty has been disregarded, and I have been left without access to the services I relied on.\n\nThis disappointing experience has made me question the level of commitment Wise has to its customers. If they are unable to meet the needs of their users or provide reasonable solutions, it is difficult for me to recommend their services to others.\n\nI urge Wise to reflect on the negative impact their inflexibility and lack of customer support can have on loyal customers. Reconsidering decisions and offering meaningful assistance would go a long way in restoring faith and trust in their platform.\n\nPlease think twice before relying on Wise for your financial needs.\n\nUpdate#2;\n\nI must express my frustration with the statement, "Do keep in mind that if/when our team makes a final decision, we won\'t be able to change it." This suggests an inflexible approach, even in cases where mistakes might have occurred.\n\nRegarding the email received on the 27th of January 2022, it is true that I was contacted by your team. However, the email did not provide a specific reason for the closure of my account, leaving me with no clear understanding of the situation. At that time, I lacked the necessary identification documents such as a Smart NID, driver\'s license, or passport, and thus submitted an appeal with my printed NID.\n\nSince then, I have acquired all the required documents, including my passport and driver\'s license. Yet, your team seems unwilling to consider my updated documentation and seems to have taken a final decision without granting me an adequate opportunity for appeal.\n\nAs a long-time user, I expected better communication and a more understanding approach to resolving this matter. The lack of transparency and flexibility in your decision-making process has left me feeling unheard and unsupported.\n\nI urge you to reconsider your stance and provide a fair chance for appeal, especially considering that circumstances have changed, and I now possess the necessary identification documents.\n\nI hope you will take this feedback into serious consideration and demonstrate a willingness to address and rectify any potential mistakes.', 'review_date': '2023-07-20', 'review_time': '11:53:37', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nJul 20, 2023\nHi there,\n\nThanks for taking the time to share your feedback with us.
