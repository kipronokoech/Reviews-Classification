As a regulated financial institution, we can assure you that we have not been hacked nor involved in any money laundering activities. We take our role seriously in ensuring the security and legitimacy of the funds passing through our platform.\n\nAt Wise, we need to know who our customers are, why they are using our services, and that their money comes from legitimate sources.

By adhering to these standards, we can continue to provide you with faster, cheaper, and more transparent service.\n\nAdditionally, different regions have varying regulatory requirements, which means that we may need to ask different questions depending on where you are sending or receiving money or where you live. We understand that giving personal info can feel intrusive, and we try to ask only the necessary information to complete the required checks. We always store your information securely and in accordance with our privacy policy, which you can review here: https://wi.se/privacy_others.\n\nWe're sorry to hear that you experienced difficulties with our customer service department.

We ended up begging them to release our money, it was humiliating because we could not pay the bills due on our property and ended up having to borrow from elsewhere.
