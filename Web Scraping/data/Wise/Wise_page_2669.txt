You're happy to process a transaction on a Friday afternoon for example knowing full well that a US bank won't be able to meet your timelines because of the weekend.

You don't indicate the wire transfer fee until too late in the transaction process meaning anyone trying to transfer an exact amount from the outset has to then adjust it and it presupposes you have that amount in your bank account in the first place. It';s negligible dollars but it screws things up if you don't apply it in the initial calculation. There is so much you can do better.

Depending on the time you're setting up the transfer on Friday, your money will only be received on Monday and this is when we'll be able to send your payment out. For the guaranteed rate, we exclude weekends, so you don't need to cancel your transfer. It'll be completed on the next working day.\n\nWe'll also always show you all the fees from our side upfront. Anything that you don't see there, it's because it is a charge from your bank, so we recommend that you reach out to them.\n\nWise.", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2021-11-15', 'CompanyReplyTime': '12:47:11'}
