The only issue was when for one transfer my identity unexpectedly (to me) had to be verified, which delayed the transaction for a couple of days. It seems unfortunate and inconvenient that any documentation that may be required cannot be pre-approved, especially if a transaction is time-sensitive. I don't know if that is a regulatory requirement or just how Transferwise chooses to do it.", 'review_date': '2020-10-27', 'review_time': '12:30:26', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
