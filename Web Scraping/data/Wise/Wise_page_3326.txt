The service is expensive and when things gone wrong especially when fund does not reach the beneficiary account, they will not do anything, not even tracking unless you provide them the detailed beneficiary bank statement. This is irresponsible, appalling and a complete breach of data privacy. I am moving my business elsewhere and will not use them ever again.\n\nUpdate 1:\n\nFirstly the payment receipt does not have the tracking info and it helps nothing. Money can sometime stuck in the international payment system so the tracking info are used to locate where the fund is. This is done without the need of any bank statement and completely irrelevant to the beneficiary's bank statement.\n\nHowever you were asking for bank statement from the beneficiary and set it as a pre-condition before you willing to do any tracking which is appalling. The money tracking can be done without the needs of bank statement from the beneficiary and this has been proven in your subsequent communication.\n\nSecondly, you were asking for very detailed bank statement from the the beneficiary and must clearly show weeks of detailed transaction, as otherwise you will not carry out the tracking (which you do not need any bank statement to initiate tracking in the first place). Would you even give this information out yourself personally if you are the beneficiary? Demanding this as a precursor to do the tracking is very reckless and unreasonable, and a big question mark on risk of complete breach of data privacy.\n\nAfter many complains, you have finally supplied the tracking info and this was done WITHOUT the bank statement. The tracking info has helped to locate the fund in no time. This could have been done easily at the first instance instead of wasting time and subjected to your appalling level of customer service.", 'review_date': '2021-04-28', 'review_time': '12:57:06', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nApr 28, 2021\nThanks for sharing your experience with us.\n\nKindly keep in mind once a transfer is completed by us, it means your money was sent to your recipient.
