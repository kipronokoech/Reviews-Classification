If you had asked me for a review a couple of weeks ago it would have been 5 stars! What changed in the last week? Wise asked for additional beneficial owner details for my company and rather than clearly stating the urgency (must be done within 14 days) at the top of the email, it was a single sentence at the bottom of the email and I made the honest mistake of missing it! I missed it because we have been through the same process with HSBC and they very clearly communicated timelines with us as well as a very clear process that needed to be followed. So I know what needed to be done and that it was important, I just had no idea that they would suspend my account without a courtesy call or another follow-up email to say "Warning, your account will be frozen if you do not respond". Now I have a frozen account with hundreds of transactions that are failing, and Wise are unable to get anyone to un-freeze my account despite me sending over all the information they need! I am now a week into having a frozen Wise account despite emailing support, phoning support and even messaging Wise senior management on LinkedIn!', 'review_date': '2023-10-28', 'review_time': '10:44:32', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
