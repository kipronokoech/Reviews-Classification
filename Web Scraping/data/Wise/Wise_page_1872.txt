I had used my Wise GBP account to convert more than the minimal amount into Euros and immediately transfer to a normal Bank in Europe. Thus the larger amount was held for less than 1 hour. The purpose to use Wise was to take advantage of the better exchange rate and lower commission that Wise has become popular for.\nHowever to my utter surprise, after the transfer I got messages stating that I will be charged a penalty for holding more than Euro 3000 in my Euro account.\nFAQ on Wise website was of no use so decided to contact Customer Service. There is no telephone number to call so tried the Chat option. It was busy and despite a number of attempts had no luck. I finally found an email address that I can send my query to.\nI received a reply but the Customer agent did not answer my specific situation and just repeated the justification why Wise have decided to charge for holding more than Euro 3000.\nCustomer service from the start-up days has gone backwards and despite the hype from Wise it is not in keeping with the image that Wise is trying to give.\nLack of clearly showing ways to contact Customer service is poor.', 'review_date': '2022-04-20', 'review_time': '15:23:01', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
