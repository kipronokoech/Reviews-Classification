{'platform': 'Wise', 'id': '61463bda6223e22118b448d0', 'stars': 1, 'title': 'Not your ordinary crooks', 'message': "They deactivated my account for no reason and asked me for personal information, including my IBAN number. I had over 4000 euro on my account. I called customer support, but they refused to give out any information regarding why my account was closed and said the problem was under investigation. After 2 weeks I filed a complaint against them with the UK Financial Ombudsman. They forced Wise to send me the money. But it took 2 months.\nIf this happened to you, know that you will never get your money back without a complaint. I am a financial auditor. I deal with fraud as part of my job. What they do is a very common strategy used by individuals who specialise in scams, where they rely on the authorities' incompetence to rob you blind. They were thought by professionals how to pull this off. If you are outside the EU or USA you will never ever see your money back because it's very hard for your authorities to intervene without going through court. If you are from the EU or USA, it will depend on the experience of the person who handles your complaint. Again, this is organized crime wrapped around a faulty judicial system exploited by professionals. They bet (just like gambling) on the fact you will not go to court and this is how they keep doing it.\nThey keep their EU accounts in Germany and I am sorry I went to the Ombudsman instead of suing them there. The authorities there would've wrecked them. People go to jail for less.\nTheir customer support is not stupid and their procedures aren't complicated. IT'S A SCHEME!!\n\nIt works like this: All customers' internal IBANs are in fact registered to Wise. So, the customers actually keep their funds in Wise's bank accounts. This money earns interest for Wise ONLY because they are an e-money company (in EU) / money business (in USA and Canada) and such companies aren't legally allowed to pay interest to their customers, therefore keep it all to themselves. This is why they have these so called procedures to keep your money with them for as long as possible. They do not give their customers a reason for the delay to prolong the hold, thus forcing their customers to eventually address the authorities. This procedure takes at least 30 days and that is why Wise says they will respond to the customer in 60 days. They assume the worst case scenario where the customer writes to the authorities almost immediate, after which they give the money back and get away clean. Some customers are more gullable and they keep their money for longer and by longer I mean INDEFINETLY. If the customer does not address the authorities eventually, loses the money. In EU, after 3 years the customer loses the right to go to court.\n\nWise has some shady lawyers.\n\nAlso, THEIR REVIEWS ARE FAKE! They have like 3-4 reviews per hour, all 5*. There are bigger and much older similar companies that don't even come close to this amount of reviews. No one gives a 5* review just because the service works as advertised, unless they get paid. It is supposed to be as advertised. People aren't r-tarded like Wise is making them look like. Maybe it's because they think of themselves to be so wise.\n\nSTAY AWAY!!!", 'review_date': '2021-10-03', 'review_time': '17:14:28', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nSep 30, 2021\nHello Val,\n\nWe understand having your account closed is frustrating, but rest assured this isn't a decision we take lightly, nor this is done without a reason.
