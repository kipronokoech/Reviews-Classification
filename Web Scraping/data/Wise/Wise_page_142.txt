The verification process went smoothly, and I was able to conduct a few transactions without any hitches. However, all hell broke loose once I started handling a significant volume of money.\n\nTo my dismay, they abruptly blocked my account, insisting that they needed to "check documents and require further details". Promptly, I provided all the requested details and documents, hoping to get back to business as usual. For a fleeting moment, it seemed like my account was functional again. But that was just the calm before the storm.\n\nIn a repetitive, almost kafkaesque scenario, my account was soft-blocked twice after only conducting a few more transactions. In desperation, I resorted to voicing my frustrations publicly on LinkedIn. The result? My account was permanently blocked and deactivated.\n\nNow, I am left in limbo, waiting for a refund of approximately $26,000. The uncertainty of the situation is agonizing, and the lack of responsiveness from Wise is utterly unacceptable.\n\nI implore you not to fall into the same trap that I did. Wise\'s handling of corporate accounts is nothing short of abysmal. Their inability to manage customer issues promptly, coupled with their tendency to indiscriminately block accounts, is indicative of a gross lack of proficiency in their operation.\n\nNot only would I discourage anyone from doing business with Wise, I wouldn\'t even wish the hassle I\'ve endured on an adversary. This is, without a doubt, the most unprofessional and unreliable financial institution I\'ve ever dealt with. They have caused me untold stress and loss, and I genuinely hope no other business has to go through the same ordeal.\n\nIn short, if you value your peace of mind and your finances, steer clear of Wise.', 'review_date': '2023-08-07', 'review_time': '14:05:54', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nAug 11, 2023\nHey there,\n\nWe understand having your account closed is frustrating, but rest assured this is never done without a reason.
