It helps us combat money laundering, and keep everyoneâ€™s money safe. That way we can keep providing you even faster, cheaper and more transparent service.\n\nThat's not all â€“ we also have different regulatory requirements in different regions. Because of this, we might need to ask more, or different, questions, depending on where you move money to or from, or where you live.\n\nPlease reach out to us at https://wi.se/contactus_ or Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram and our team can gladly take a look at your transfer.\n\nWise", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2023-07-19', 'CompanyReplyTime': '12:08:36'}

However, there was a problem with transferring money from my current account to my Wise account - and when I rang them, it turned out they had my money for a week and had not put it into my account. The customer service rep had very little knowledge â€” refused to transfer me to someone who might know how to fix the issue, and then queried why I wanted to make a complaint. I ve ended up transferring all funds out of Wise - I donâ€™t have time to be dealing with poor customer service, especially when it comes to money.

It sounds like you're going through the verification stage of opening a business account. If that's the case, let us shed some light into this process.\n\nVerification is not only essential for keeping your business's money safe, but also to ensure that we comply with the financial regulations in the countries we operate in. So, while we try to make it quick and painless, we also need to make sure your business meets our Acceptable Use Policy. This sometimes means the process takes a tad longer than we initially expect.\n\nWe did check on your account, and it seems that our team emailed you on the 17th of July with some instructions.
