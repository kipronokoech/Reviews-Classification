{'platform': 'Wise', 'id': '609655def9f4870a787226ac', 'stars': 4, 'title': 'Overall - a good experience but with a challenges', 'message': 'I commenced using Wise in January 2021 when I was moving from the US to Turkey and needed to consolidate my finances held in four countries and progressively transmit monies to Turkey, where I am going to live permanently.\n\nOverall, I am impressed by Wise, including the speed of the transfers, low fees and competitive exchange rates. I will continue to use Wise on a regular basis in transferring funds between countries, moving forward.\n\nThat said, two issues arose over this period which caused some angst.\n\nThe first was after successfully and efficiently transferring monies via. wise between four countries for about 2 months, suddenly Wise froze all my money transfers and asked me to justify where the money came from.\n\nI understand of course that Wise are required to verify transfers by government regulators (and I\'m really annoyed that these days Western governments consider that their citizens - going about their lawful daily business - are considered to automatically be guilty of a serious offences (such as money laundering, terrorism etc), unless they can "prove" their innocence. What happened to the "presumption of innocence" that Western governments use to talk about, to show how great they were?).\n\nHaving monies frozen by Wise for almost a week cost me a lot of money because it was unexpected and happened in the middle of purchasing a new home and at a time when I needed these funds. Indeed, this freezing of my money caused several problems for me. Fortunately, I keep very good records and was able to provide wise with a range of documents to show everything was fine and legitimate and legal, and after a week my funds were unfrozen by Wise. The person dealing with my case at Wise was efficient, professional and capable.\n\nThe key lesson here is, if Wise needs someone to justify themselves or their transfers, do it soon after someone joins-up and not after a few months - when they have started to trust Wise and are in the middle of an important transaction (such as buying a new home!), and unexpectedly find that their money is "frozen".\n\nThe second question with Wise relates to role clarity of their business model. Wise have a fantastic business model for transferring monies, including between countries in various currencies. They provide a much cheaper and quicker service than transitional financial institutions. But does Wise also offer other financial services, or just focus their business model on global money transfers? This is unclear to me, so I\'m unsure, for example, whether I should keep significant funds in Wise accounts, and have regular remittances sent directly to Wise accounts et al. Or alternatively, should I simply use Wise for global money transfers? More clarity on Wise\'s role, offerings and business planning intentions would be appreciated (including whether Wise change additional fees if someone keeps significant funds in their Wise accounts).', 'review_date': '2021-05-08', 'review_time': '09:11:58', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
