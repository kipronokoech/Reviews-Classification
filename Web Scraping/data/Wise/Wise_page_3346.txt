If the transfer still isn't with the recipient we recommend sharing the transfer receipt for your transfer with the recipient. With that they can review the details and share it with their bank. The bank should be able to confirm any updates or status from their end. You can see how to download the receipt here: https://wi.se/getpdfreceipt_.\n\nGive it a go and let us know what their bank says. Hopefully it can get squared away in a timely matter.\n\nThank you,\nThe Wise Team", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2021-04-16', 'CompanyReplyTime': '19:54:41'}
