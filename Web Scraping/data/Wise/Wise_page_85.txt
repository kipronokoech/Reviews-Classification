It helps us combat money laundering, and keep everyone’s money safe. That way we can continue to provide even faster, cheaper and more transparent service for you, for everyone.\n\nWe also have different regional regulatory requirements. Which is why we might need to ask more – or different – questions, depending on where you move money to or from, or where you live.\n\nWhen there’s a delay, we need a little more time to verify the information you have shared. We’ll update you as soon as everything’s done on our side.\n\nCurrently, we don't offer customer support via chat, but you can contact us by phone, email or social media.

This might happen if we need to carry out compliance related checks, which are a legal requirement. We cannot be responsible for any delays as a result of carrying out those checks.\n\nIn this case, it sounds like your business might be undergoing some verification checks.\n\nVerification is how we keep your business’s money safe, according to different financial regulations. We do everything we can to make it quick and painless, but we also need to make sure your business meets our Acceptable Use Policy. Sometimes this will take a little longer than we first expected.\n\nIf we need additional information from you, we’ll always reach out. In the meantime, we’ll keep you updated along the way.\n\nShould you have other questions, contact us directly at: https://wi.se/contactus, or reach out to us on X (Twitter), Facebook, or Instagram with your email and user number.
