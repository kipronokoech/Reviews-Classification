The first time they short changed me by $100 (ish) - and told me oh, I must take it up with Lloyds, they said clearly I hadn\'t given them instruction by their cut off time. However, as I had made the instruction late at night Sunday my time in USA, so Lloyds would get it as soon as they opened - AND would do the transfer that same day - when the money arrived three days LATE and SHORT, WISE told me it\'s LLOYDS\' fault. I contacted Lloyds and they told me no it wasn\'t - they sent the money out on time. I decided to try again - sent instruction on the 20th January, supposed to get here in USA 21st - GUESS WHAT IT\'S 24th January and the money STILL hasn\'t arrived - AND I\'M NOW $103.88 SHORT!!!!!! I\'ve received notification that this money is "in progress" but THIS IS NOT THE AMOUNT I WAS PROMISED. When I call Wise, they just blame Lloyds, but Llloyds sends out the wire ON TIME SO WISE WILL GET IT IN THEIR UK BANK THE NEXT DAY - well within the 24 hour guarantee period. I WILL NOT USE THEM AGAIN. i am disgusted with them. And WOW is it difficult to contact them - impossible to find a phone number - have to rely on emails! I\'M DONE WITH WISE. NEVER AGAIN.
