After the transfer is completed and i went to track it, it then said up to two working days. Two working days are gone and the help centre says up to 4 working days and you have to yourself download the receipt and chase the other bank because they are done with the transaction. What’s the point of using you in the first place if you can’t do the follow up with your partner bank whom you have sent the transfer to and have a contact there. How am I suppose to call the other bank and incur international call charges on top of fees paid for the transfer because you don’t want to follow up with them.

Delays do happen for different reasons. It could be because the transfer was set up closer to the weekend/holidays, or because we needed to carry extra checks. You can read about it here: https://wi.se/howlongdotransferstake\n\nWe do have a procedure for this, and the first step is for you to reach out to the receiving bank and provide a transfer receipt, as this may help them locate the money.\n\nKeep in mind that we don't know the external bank's processing times, but we do our best to give you the most accurate estimate possible.\n\nIf you need more help, you can always contact us directly at: https://wi.se/contactus, or on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram with your email and user number.

I really appreciate how easy it is to use, their transparency, and how they write their policies in a really easy-to-understand way.\nI primarily use Wise for transferring money overseas. First off, they give a transparent, mid-market exchange rate. You can always see exactly what the exchange rate is and how much you're actually transferring, what it equates to in each currency, and what the fees are, all upfront before you send!\nAlso, the transfer is literally instant! I sent money from my US account to pay an initial deposit on an apartment in the UK, and paid my final month's rent for my apartment in Japan in the same day. I was on the phone with my connection in Japan while I sent the funds and it literally showed in their account in seconds. Amazing!\nI'm impressed and will continue to use Wise for all of my money transfer needs.", 'review_date': '2023-08-26', 'review_time': '09:56:02', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

But the website is difficult to navigate, with an interface that has very few options on any screen. It has a very clean looking interface, but this is because few explanatory details or "fine print" is ever written out. But this is frustrating and it misleads the customer.\n\nWise responds to queries with simple one-liners that don\'t supply information. For instance, we have had a problem sending money to a recipient that we\'ve sent to successfully in the past.\n\nWise sends a note that the transfer was sent back to them, and then asks the sender to fix the details. But the details are all correct, because we\'ve used them in the past successfully.\n\nOn the recipients end, if they try to track the transfer, the get a brief one-liner that "the transfer is paused until the sender makes some updates first."\n\nWhen the recipient (my friend) has checked at her bank, the bank says that there is nothing wrong with the details. There is no reason why it should have bounced.\n\nYet Wise won\'t report this that they are the ones having problems, or even that the bank rejected the transfer. Instead just the note that they are waiting for the sender to "make some updates."\n\nWhen I spoke to Wise on the phone, they insisted that the problem is with the bank. But they won\'t tell the recipient this. They say that they are waiting for the sender to "make some updates." So it is has become impossible to fix a transfer that Wise won\'t admit does not work.\n\nThis is just part of their opaqueness, their clean interface that obscures needed information. It makes it hard to actually interact with their service.
