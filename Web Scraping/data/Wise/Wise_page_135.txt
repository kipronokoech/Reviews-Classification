In the past I have always been very satisfied with Wise's service.\nBut in the meantime, Wise has introduced verification of the origin of money. This verification is not transparent for the customer and probably not adapted to the national regulations on the origin of money. Evidence of the origin of the money is required without specifying exactly what information would be accepted. The evidence is requested after the money is send to Wise and the evidence is rejected without a specific justification\n(a succinct reference to internal guidelines is not a concrete justification!). In view of the rather low amount of the transfer from average earners, it is also incomprehensible why Wise accuses its customer of white-collar crime.\nAt this point, I don't want to accuse Wise of fraudulent intent, but at least the current procedure is unprofessional and customer-unfriendly.\nI will look for another service provider, even if they offer a less favorable exchange rate.", 'review_date': '2023-08-11', 'review_time': '12:23:39', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nAug 11, 2023\nHi there,\n\nWe're all about speed, but safety is something that we hold in the highest regard.
