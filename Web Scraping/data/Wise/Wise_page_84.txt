Very bad experience with Wise.', 'message': "Hi, I want to express my experience with Wise which I have loved so far. Last Saturday September 9, 2023, suddenly my account was blocked with all my money in it. It is not possible to transfer, use cards. TOTAL BLOCK. This is a hold on my money. Money that is the fruit of my work. It is the same money that is given by my mother who is disabled. My online job is one of the few I can do, because my disabled mother needs me to always be with her. She gave them to me to help me do my work online so she and my family could live in a dignified way and up until now I had succeeded and this made me very happy. It made my life full of satisfaction because with the little I did, I gave a lot to those who were less fortunate than me.\nWhat law in the world allows Wise to freeze my money for so long, to do checks that she can't even do? I wrote several times with the support and with a certain Violet from their team. I sent documents, bank statements, tax returns, tax returns of pension payments. Everything is not good because there is a quibble or something that is not good for their team. It's unacceptable... we are people!! We are not SLAVES!!! I send the tax return and they tell me it's too old and I tell them that in my country the tax return is done every year. If we are at the end of this year, but we are not yet in November, it is obvious that the most recent tax return has not yet been produced!! Another absurd and unacceptable thing. They ask for a bank statement, I send them the latest official bank statement, but they tell me it is older than 3 months. I then reply that my bank produces bank statements every 3 months and at the end of the quarter the official bank statement is still not available. (traditional bank in EU country). I send the bank report signed by the director and they still tell me that the bank statement is not the official one. I can't take it anymore, it makes me want to die. ALL MY MONEY DAMN ME FOR LEFT THEM IN THE WISE ACCOUNT!!!!! They are the fruit of my work, of my online sales. It's the money I have to give to the state to PAY TAXES!! This is horrible. Excuse my outburst but I'd rather die than get screwed like this. God will not decide the day of my death if you don't give me my money back.", 'review_date': '2023-09-16', 'review_time': '01:28:23', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

We only ever close accounts that are being used in a way that goes against our Terms of Use: https://wi.se/customeragreement\n\nIf you think we’ve made a mistake, you can follow these guidelines to appeal our decision: https://wi.se/accountdeactivation. We’ll review your request and get back to you ASAP via email.\n\nWhen we deactivate your account, we cancel all pending payments. After reviewing your account, we’ll work on returning any money that was already sent, the way we received it.\n\nIf you still have money in your account, we'll work on sending it back to you. But first, we need to carry out due diligence checks. While we do that, your money and information stays safe and secure.\n\nWise", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2023-09-18', 'CompanyReplyTime': '11:18:41'}

But around a month ago, I noticed unauthorized charges on my credit card from Thailand via Apple Pay, even though I've never owned an Apple device. In detail, there were 139 charges totaling $13,000, all while I was withdrawing money in Switzerland.\nWhen I contacted Wise, I was met with generic responses that failed to address my particular issue. I want to stress that these charges were never approved by me. It's perplexing that Wise didn't initially detect these suspicious transactions, especially since they occurred almost simultaneously from two distant locations and were so numerous in such a brief period. This leads me to think that Wise might have serious security vulnerabilities and their support is inadequate when it's most needed.", 'review_date': '2023-09-15', 'review_time': '14:57:21', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
