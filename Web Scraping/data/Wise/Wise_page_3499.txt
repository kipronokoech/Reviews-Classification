As a result, instead of sending the large amount in one transfer it had to be sent in two which obviously proved to be considerably more expensive. It was never made clear when I deposited the money that it could not be readily moved to add to other money sent from my UK bank account. I also find it difficult to get help and support immediately.

However, I would just like to add that when you create a transfer on your TransferWise account, we'll need to receive that exact amount you have set up the transfer for.\n\nThat means if you send less money we'll reach out to you so you can pay for the remaining, and if you send us more money, we'll refund you the excess amount.\n\nBesides the chat, you can also find our contact form and phone numbers here > https://wi.se/contactus_.\n\nAll the best,\nJackie at TransferWise", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2021-02-10', 'CompanyReplyTime': '10:18:07'}
