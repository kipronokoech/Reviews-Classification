Which I did by email because it was written: ‚Äú##- Please type your reply above this line -##‚Äù.\nBut then I received an automatic email saying that through this email Wise did not get the information (it was pretty sure when you see an email with ‚Äúnoreply‚Äù).\nSo, I created a new ticket to send the documents they asked. You can already notice there is a PROBLEM WITH THEIR SYSTEM / MESSAGIN SERVICE as WE CANNOT REPLY TO A FORMAL TICKETS as we would like.\n3) I created several times tickets number and every time I‚Äôve got an answer saying they got everything and they will send the money. I asked 2 times and those 2 times: ‚Äúno worries, we‚Äôve got everything to proceed with your money‚Äù.\n4) And finally, they cancelled the transfer! Not only the money was not sent but:\na) this shows a HUGE INCOMPETENCE\nb) if I want to send money again, I will lose the conversion rate which was really interesting at that time.\nc) I paid fees for nothing!\nd) I waste my time for 2 weeks! 2 weeks just to send money! We are in a modern society but looks like they are at the beginning of the Internet.\n5) I even called them to be careful for the transfer! They just did nothing and that shows how BAD THEY ARE.\n6) Even by calling them, they asked me to send money again. I did but same problem as before: they received the documents but did not check them so the transfer was cancelled again DESPITE CALLING THEM AND WARNING them.\nWhat a REALLY BAD SERVICE! Please AVOID THEM as much as you can, even Moneygram or Western Union are much better.\nWHAT A WASTE OF TIME I SPENT!
