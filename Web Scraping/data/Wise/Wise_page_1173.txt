I receive my money and am able to send it on and it’s all close to instant.\n\nThe downsides are:\n-1 ⭐️ : they’re expensive compared to similar services. For example, a monthly transfer costs me around £50, but my colleagues who use another service pay £7.99 per month and nothing extra but still get the exchange rate. They always come out on top compared to me.\n\n-1 ⭐️ : customer service is too slow and chaotic. Usually you don’t need it, but the one time I did it took nearly 5 days to resolve an urgent issue. In this day and age this is unforgivable.\n\nIt’s for these reasons I will likely be switching to another service soon, but additionally:\n\n-1 ⭐️ : they offered a bonus to people who bought shares and held them for a year. This has basically been and gone now and my enquiries have garnered no useful information. This is effectively fraud and I am considering a complaint to the financial ombudsman if I don’t hear something by the end of September, possibly even legal action. On top of that the sketchy behaviour of the CEO has driven the share price into the ground.\n\nEdit after reply from Wise on Saturday 27 August at 5.30pm UK time, 3 hours after my review went live:\n\n1/ I just tried your tool and it strangely enough doesn’t show the other service I was referring to, which now you have forced the issue I will reveal is Revolut. £7.99 per month, no extra fees, guaranteed exchange rates.\n\n2/ It’s funny you are able to respond to this review on a Saturday within hours of me posting it but when I needed help it took you close to 5 days. Your priorities are all wrong.\n\n3/ To be clear, I am a member of OwnWise. The last email I had was August 10th and said it would take 2 months to process. Well the year past in July so I suggest you send an update pronto because this just seems like a stalling tactic so you can back out of the agreement.
