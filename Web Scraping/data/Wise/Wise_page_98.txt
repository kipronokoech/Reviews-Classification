{'platform': 'Wise', 'id': '64f7d202516634ac7d6f0f14', 'stars': 1, 'title': "Wise threatened me to block my account because I didn't behave well", 'message': 'I asked Wise\'s technical support a question twice that wasn\'t answered: why should I ask someone who sent me money through Wise for their personal data, when Wise itself can perfectly ask it directly (and maybe it\'s quite embarrassing for me to ask)?\n\nInstead of getting a proper answer, the technical support gave me, twice, a generic answer on "como posso receber meu dinheiro" (how can I get my money). I was not trying to understand how to get it, but why it was asked TO ME (the recipient) to ask the sender personal data that I am not supposed to know, neither ask (like the sender\'s birthday or nationality).\n\nThat was never answered.\n\nInstead, the second time, I received a mail stating that "Informamos tamb√©m que a Wise n√£o tolera comunica√ß√µes abusivas ou agressivas, caso esse comportamento for repetido, san√ß√µes podem ser impostas a sua conta.". In other words: if you don\'t behave well (in their criteria), we will block your money.\n\nSo, what did I do? I have just transferred all the money to my Italian account, because I don\'t like to be threatened, I don\'t want to trust a service that deliberately makes me feel insecure, and I don\'t put my money in a bank which tells me that it can "punish me" by restricting my account (and the money contained in it) if it thinks that I am being aggressive (like insisting on a question it doesn\'t want to answer).\nAnd I will transfer immediately any value I receive on Wise in the future, so I will not have the risk of having my money blocked when I need it, just because a Wise employee didn\'t like that I insisted on a question that he clearly doesn\'t want to answer.\n\nPersonally, I don\'t think threatening a client and then losing his trust is ... a *wise* decision. But Unicredit is happy now, as it has already received the money and will be receiving any amount that comes in my Wise account from now on.\n\n________________\nPS: funny, they answered very fast, doing exactly what I criticized, again: my question was not answered and again they explained that they need to collect some information (just to remember, this is not what I am trying to discuss, I want to know why they ask ME to ask those infos to the money\'s sender ‚Äì which was NEVER answered, not even here in their answer).\n\nFor the rest, seriously:\n"Regarding the message about abusive communication, we want to clarify that we don\'t send it unless the situation warrants it. It\'s never our intention to make you feel threatened. All we want is to maintain a friendly and open line of communication with all our customers."\n\nThere are some problems with that statement:\n1) Well, by saying that, they are almost saying that I offended someone, which is a lie; they felt offended because I insisted on my question (which seems to bother them), just that. It\'s "never their intention to make me feel threatened", but they just did it again by denying that it was unnecessary and by suggesting that I gave them reasons to threat me ‚Äì this is not what I call "friendly and open line communication". I should have been so simple to just apologize and recognize that they made a mistake (or their employee was not wiling to answer me) and messed up with the tone. So easy. But they really chose to confirm that I better put my money elsewhere.\n\n2) Wise, you don\'t suggest that my message was abusive. You show WHERE and HOW it was abusive (and then we will discuss if it really was), or you apologize. That\'s all. Don\'t make those stupid insinuations "oh, we only send that when we receive an abusive message". Be clear!! Show me how I allegedly was abusive. Or just apologize, without trying to suggest anything.\n\n3) let\'s state clearly that EVEN if I had offended someone, it would not give Wise the right to block my money. In any case, blocking my money would be perfectly ilegal.\n\nWith this experience, reinforced by their answer here, trying to justify ilegal mesures, I am now able to tell to those who read that: search for more infos about Wise blocking money of their clients in the net, think well and ... be wise, don\'t let your money with them, don\'t wait for them to block it, or even think they have the right to threaten you.', 'review_date': '2023-09-07', 'review_time': '20:46:37', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nSep 6, 2023\nHi Leonardo,\n\nAs a regulated financial institution, verification is key to us ‚Äì we need to know who‚Äôs using our service, why, and that their money comes from a legitimate place.

The reality is however, that when trying to log in, you land on a page saying the account is blocked and are walked through steps different from the ones indicated in the email. Second, there is no way to submit all the documents required in one round. It seems one can only submit documents related to one category of income, and there is no way to answer the question posed in the email about relationship to a recipient. There should be a way to revisit and add documents for various categories of income and answer the question about relationship to the beneficiary. Overall for me this meant waiting 4 working days to receive a response and spending a 5th working day providing the required documentation in as many rounds as there are questions posed in the email.', 'review_date': '2023-09-05', 'review_time': '20:08:37', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
