On Monday the 19th the banks WERE open HALF DAY in Turkey.

Dear Harsha, I suggest you start reading emails before writing me this generic email. Just google it and you will see on Monday banks were open until noontime. How difficult it was for WISE just to google this matter and find out which days were bank holidays? I cannot even believe you just simply don't read and understand emails. WISE does not know which days are bank holidays or not and halting the transfers on the grounds of ignorance. Whoever reads this review from Wise, can you please google to see if on 19th of July Monday the banks in Turkey was really closed? Can you please do this simple search and tell me that you actually got it wrong?\n\nIncompetent service and pure ignorance", 'review_date': '2021-07-20', 'review_time': '13:55:42', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nJul 23, 2021\nHello, Gamze!\nWhen it comes to delivery estimates there's a lot of different factors that go into calculating when and how fast we can deliver payments. Due to that, even if the physical banks remained open for a few hours during a public holiday doesn't necessarily mean the delivery window would have allowed all payments to be completed during it, which is why we made sure to advise our customers to expect a delay.\n\nHope this helps,\nWise team", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2021-07-23', 'CompanyReplyTime': '10:20:46'}
