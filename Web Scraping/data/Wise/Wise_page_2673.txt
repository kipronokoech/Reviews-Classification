It doesn’t cross any borders, so it doesn’t show up as a foreign transaction.\n\nWhat looks like lack of support, it is just us making sure we're working complying with our regulators.\n\nMore on THB transfers here: https://bit.ly/300l0zK\n\nWise.", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2021-11-05', 'CompanyReplyTime': '14:23:32'}
