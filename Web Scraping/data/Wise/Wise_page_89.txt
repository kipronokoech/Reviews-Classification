We thrive on feedback, so hearing what you think is really important to us.\n\nWhen we convert money, we do it using the mid-market exchange rate. We get this rate from Reuters – and they update it in real-time, during the trading market opening hours. You can read more here: https://wise.com/gb/mid-market-rate\n\nWe try to give our customers the best rate possible, but we know that sometimes our competitors may have better prices. Our goal is for you to save money on our transfers, even if you make that transfer with someone else. This is why we always have our comparison tool easily accessible to everyone: https://wi.se/comparerates\n\nIf there's anything else we can do to make our services better for you, please let us know. We'd love to hear what else you have to say.\n\nWise", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2023-09-15', 'CompanyReplyTime': '21:11:51'}

For more info about how we're regulated and our security measures, check this: https://wi.se/regulation and https://wi.se/wise_security.\n\nWhen you open a bank account, you usually need to provide documents to verify details about yourself.

Which is why we might need to ask more – or different – questions, depending on where you move money to or from, or where you live. Verification can be required at different stages of your journey with us, which is why you might feel like you went through the process more than once.\n\nYou can use Wise in most countries around the world, as such, we do accept phone numbers from outside the US.
