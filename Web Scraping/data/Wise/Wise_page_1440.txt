Last week, the app said that a verification is needed but the link wa s broken and for 5 days we couldnt get verified. After 5 days in which we couldnt pay out the suppliers everything returned to normal for two days. Today(day of this review) our account was suspended without any explanations. Please note that we are a small company with pretty much the same suppliers in years, and one or two new customers every 3 month. So no way we could have done something fraudulent. Also the overall tranzactions are no more 20 000/year back and forth.\nI am curious what will happen, because we submitted an appeal, and if we will ever get out money back.\nEither they have a software glitch or something very wrong is happening over there.\nAnyway be wise and dont rely on them or dont rely on them solely. We did this mistake and now, next week will be hell.\n\n\n\nHi Wise,\nDo note that after working with your team, our account was reopened. I will give a 3 starts to wise now because of your colleague who was kind enough to let us know why the account was closed.(without him all would have been lost). It was due to the fact that we had a map on our website which was showing 2 russian locations. So we erased them(we havent worked with that supplier for over 2 years but wise never checked our payments)and everything was solved.\nBut, an institution like yours should ask questions first and shoot later. Also, even if we would have done something wrong, you should have left us with at least the posibility to get our statements. Freeze the money but not the whole account!This is the normal way to investigate a customer who has been with you for more than five years.
