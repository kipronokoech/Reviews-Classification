This can happen if we need to perform compliance or verification checks.\n\nWe take customer verification very seriously, as we need to comply with regulations. It's essential for us to know who is using our service, why they are using it, and that their funds come from a legitimate source. This process helps us combat money laundering and ensures the safety of everyone's money.\n\nWhile it may seem redundant to verify your account again, please understand that we occasionally need to reverify our customers, even if they had already completed the process during registration or at another stage. This is to ensure that our records are up-to-date and to maintain a high level of security.\n\nAbout our support team, we do have agents looking at the cases, and you can reach out to us via phone, email or on social media.
