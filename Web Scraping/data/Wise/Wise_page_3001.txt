Our goal is still to reach Mission Zero - little to no fees on all transfers - but for now we do need to charge fees on most routes, especially USD, due to how they are processed between banks.\n\nShould you be unsure how much something might cost you can always check our calculator here: https://wise.com/gb/pricing/send-money at any time, or contact our support: https://wise.com/help/contact for more info.\n\nHope this helps,\nWise team', 'CompanyReplyDate': '2021-07-23', 'CompanyReplyTime': '11:40:51'}
