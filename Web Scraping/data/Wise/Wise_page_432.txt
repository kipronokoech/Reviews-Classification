Today, I have the immense pleasure of reviewing the "Bank of Utter Incompetence," where the staff members seem to have earned their degrees from the prestigious "University of Cluelessness."\n\nSeriously, if you\'re looking for a bank that excels in wasting your time, this is the place for you.\n\nThe moment you receive a notice "we need to verify some details", you\'re going experience something like your worst dental appointments.\n\nThe "friendly" staff are just so eager to help you, but only after a week or so, and, obviously only after they finish their all-important personal conversations.\n\nWhen it\'s finally your turn, brace yourself for a journey through the twisted labyrinth of banking incompetence.\n\nNeed to get verified?!\n\nGreat, they\'ll ask you for the same documents seventeen times because apparently, bankstatements, auditor reports and dividend warrants are a foreign concept to them.\n\nWant to transfer money? Don\'t worry, sit down and relax... and relax... and relax... and.... It\'s a fun game to see how many attempts it takes for them to get it right. (if they do...)\n\nNow, let\'s discuss their obnoxious assistance. The staff at the "Bank of Utter Incompetence" must have taken a course in condescension because they seem to enjoy making their customers feel like brainless farts. After all, who wouldn\'t want to be treated like a five-year-old when asking about banking services?\n\nAnd don\'t even get me started on their "state-of-the-art" online banking platform. It\'s so user-friendly (read: absolutely not) that you\'ll have the time of your life trying to get verified. But hey, at least you\'ll have something to bond with your fellow bank patrons over, as you all commiserate about your shared misery.\n\nIn conclusion, if you\'re looking for a bank that will make you question your sanity and possibly send you running back to the warm embrace of your childhood piggy bank, look no further than the "Bank of Utter Incompetence." The only thing they\'re consistent about is their ability to disappoint you.', 'review_date': '2023-03-27', 'review_time': '09:40:33', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
