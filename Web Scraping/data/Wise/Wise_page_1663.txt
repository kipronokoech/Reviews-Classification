Although there was some unfortunate misunderstanding on my part that meant I decided to close my account with them. I was looking into alternatives sites to Paypal that I could use with my freelancing business. Being dyslexic I think I misunderstood what I read about the way that Wise does invoicing and realised that maybe, this wasn't the best for my particular needs. At this point I had already paid some money to open currency accounts with Wise but I hadn't used any of the services offered, so I tried asking for my money back, explaining my mistake. The support emails I received were clear, concise and very easy for me to understand, and I got my money back! They let me know to contact them if I ever want to open up an account in the future.", 'review_date': '2022-05-31', 'review_time': '10:27:35', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

My experience has changed and therefore I would like to add a completely opposite post. I used Transferwise in full compliance with both their own and ethical rules, and suddenly they canceled my account for no reason at all. I asked several times to explain why my account was canceled. They replied that they could cancel the accounts without explanation. So I learned no reason to cancel. Not only did they cancel my account, but I didn't have access to a list of payments, so I had great difficulty finding out where the money came from and where it didn't. I tried to create a new account, but it was also canceled without explanation.
