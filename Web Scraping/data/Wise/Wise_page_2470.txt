Besides that, weekends and holidays can cause some delays, as not all banks operate over this time.\n\nMore at:https://wi.se/whymytransferistakinglonger_.\n\nFrom our end, we're always aiming for the speed and if you'd like us to check out your transfer, please get in touch at:https://wi.se/contactus_.\n\nBest wishes,\nWise.", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2022-01-06', 'CompanyReplyTime': '09:29:44'}

Linking a wise account to paypal is useless as you can only link an account of the same currency of paypal. For example, if you have a paypal account in Belgium and you receive a paiment in dollars, you can transfer it to wise.
