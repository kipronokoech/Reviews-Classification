Our recent experience is rather slow: We made two payments at approximately the same time, we were told it would arrive within one week (both at the same time). One payment went through, one did not. For the latter one, the status was updated several times without any reason. Reason provided by the customer service chat was a technical issue of the bank, which may be an excuse, as the other payment, scheduled for the same time, has arrived. On each contact, we were told that it would arrive today. Sent on 11 May, it was scheduled for 18 May and arrived on 21 May.', 'review_date': '2021-06-04', 'review_time': '10:33:45', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nMay 24, 2021\nSorry to hear you didn't have the best experience with your last transfer, Nina.\n\nRest assured is never our intention to delay payments or cause any hassle for you. It's possible that two payments set up at the same time, will be completed in different days or share different estimate delivery time. That can happen for a few reasons.\n\nIf we bumped into a technical issue, rest assured we're doing our best to fix it as soon as possible and complete your payment.\n\nAll the best,\nWise Team.", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2021-05-24', 'CompanyReplyTime': '16:13:00'}

Tried to submit an international payment twice on both occasions it was cancelled with no reason given. As there was no local support number I contact them over email and they were very slow to respond. When they did I was asked to provide identification documents which I did immediately but then no one responded to me again and the transfer was cancelled. The error message on the site gave no indication that any additional documents were required and if it had I would have uploaded them right away. I have used the service before when it was branded Transfer Wise so not sure if something has changed but I wont be using or recommending this service again. I ended up submitting a standard international bank transfer and the fees were actually lower than Wise and it didn't take long so I am really not sure what the use case is for the Wise service as It was expensive and I wasted over a week trying to process this transfer.\n\nUPDATED WITH REPLY:\nI fully understand that you are a regulated financial institution and need to perform checks. My feedback is not that you had to do this it is that you paused my transfer without telling me why. I only knew that you required extra documents when I contacted your support desk more that 24 hours after submitting the transfer and then after I supplied all the requested documents I stopped getting responses and you cancelled the transfer anyway. This happened twice. If your website had requested the extra documents when I submitted the transfer I would have uploaded them straight away but I just received a generic holding message asking me to wait for further contact. As per my previous comments a standard bank transfer was quicker and cheaper and I will be doing that going forward.", 'review_date': '2021-05-25', 'review_time': '03:04:48', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nMay 24, 2021\nSorry to hear you didn't have the best experience while using us, Tom.\n\nWe aim to complete all transfers as fast as we can and with no hassle for you, but as a regulated financial institution we need to carry extra checks on payments from time to time.
