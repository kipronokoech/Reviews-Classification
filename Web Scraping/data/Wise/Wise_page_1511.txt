I used an immediate payment option and incurred extra fees to ensure it would appear in my account immediately. Unfortunately I did this but the top up was not actioned and was applied to a different transfer. The transaction which locked in the rate expired. I then cancelled it so it would not be processed at a live rate and then had to wait several working days for it to be returned through my own bank. Eventually when I was able to re start the transaction I ended up paying $130 more than what I originally set it up for.
