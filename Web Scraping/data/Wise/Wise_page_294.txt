So, for this reason we didn't use our normal currency company, gaining us around £50. However, at the end of the long process as a new customer, a charge of £34 was announced, so we're not much better off. Too late to back out. Also, I tried to ask them questions regarding the completion of the form via the help section twice during the transaction with no reply.

We appreciate hearing from our customers, as it helps us improve our services. While we're glad to hear that your funds were transferred abroad immediately, we understand your concerns about the fee discrepancy and the lack of timely assistance during the process. Allow us to address these points for you.\n\nWe strive to be transparent with our fees, and it's important to us that our customers have a clear understanding of the costs involved. However, there are certain situations, such as when sending money via SWIFT, where intermediary banks may apply their own commissions. Unfortunately, these fees are beyond our control, as they are determined by the banks themselves. You can find more information about SWIFT payments here: https://wi.se/swiftpayments_\n\nIt does sound like your transfer could've been done via SWIFT, but if you have other questions, please contact us here: https://wi.se/contactus_, or message us on Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter with your email and user number, we'll be more than happy to investigate the case.\n\nWe also apologize for the lack of response to your inquiries during the transaction. Our customer support team is usually prompt in providing assistance, and it's unfortunate that you didn't receive the help you needed.\n\nThanks for bringing these concerns to our attention. We genuinely appreciate your feedback as it helps us grow and serve you better. If you have any other questions or concerns, don't hesitate to reach out to us through the provided channels.\n\nWise", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2023-05-29', 'CompanyReplyTime': '06:16:35'}
