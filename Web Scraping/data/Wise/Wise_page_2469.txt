If you don't do it, the transfer will not continue. I don't think it is wise to request documents in the middle of a transfer. What if the transfer is important and you don't have them at hand? This happened to me\n\nAnother thing to improve is that the some transfers take a lot of time to complete.

A guy called Oskar wanted more information (e.g. declaration form signed by the beneficiary). I sent the info.\n\nThen after 2 days they wanted to know, from where the money comes from (my private savings obviously), so I sent my bank account balances of the last 3 months.\n\nWise answered that they will procesz the info. If there will be no further questions, then I can expect the money to arrive in 2-5 workdays!!!\n\nI don\'t recommend sending money via Wise.
