To make another appeal as they adviced me here needs 15 business days to be reviewed. Why any financial corporation should need 15-20 BUSINESS days to answer the customers questions or get back to them. They are clearly making money from all that. I saw thousands of peoples reviews and everyone has same problem . I am going to sue this company if I DO NOT GET MY MONEY BACK UNTILL THE END OF THIS MONTH.
