One of the reasons can be that the transfer was set up closer to the weekend/holidays. Please mind that we can only move your money during normal banking hours. And things may take a little longer if the country you’re sending to have a national holiday, or it's the weekend.\n\nIf you need help with a specific transfer, you can always contact us here: https://wi.se/contactus_ or Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram with your email and user number. We will gladly review and provide you with the necessary assistance.\n\nWise", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2022-10-27', 'CompanyReplyTime': '09:28:39'}

I was disappointed, I was frustrated but however I accepted their decision. However, after the closure I still had funds in the Wise account, apprx 170 000 krona. They asked me to make an appeal to get my funds back, which I did and after that nothing happened. I have been wating for almost one month and still did not get the refund.\nI have been trying to contact them regarding this matter and everything I receive as an answer is that this is the procedure due to their regulation. I honestly believe that no regulation will require Wise to keep funds for one month+ for any reason. They solely decided to keep the funds and wait for 30+days. I have emailed them that I will start a legal procedure and now it is not a matter of money but about their policy of locking people's funds. I can see down in the comments that other people experienced the same problem as me.

When we close an account with money on it, we need to carry due diligence checks first. Once these checks are completed, we always get in touch about the refund.\n\nDue diligence checks are conducted to verify the information you have provided to us. We are required to do these at all stages of the customer relationship, not just during the initial onboarding stage, so this means during the customer relationship as well as during the deactivation stage.\n\nIf it has been longer than 60 working days, please give us a call at https://wi.se/contactus_. Make sure to choose one of the options below “what’s your question about”, and you’ll see our numbers and contact form there.
