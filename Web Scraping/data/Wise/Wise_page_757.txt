I reside in Colombia, with Colombian accounts, and require COP withdrawals.\nThey take my money, no questions asked. So that\'s great. But no warnings or information at all about whether I will be able to get my money back out again. Here I go to pull my money back out from my USD account back into my bank in Colombia for COP, and it turns out that my account cannot go from USD to COP. I have no holds or warnings on my account, I\'ve completed all verifications.\n\nThere is no information, nor are there any warnings about this, when sending them my money. Why is COP even an option if it\'s not available for use? Why does my account not show any limitations or holds? I\'ve done everything required and have neglected nothing. I guess my only recourse would be to perform a chargeback on my credit card.\n\nThey offer absolutely no warnings about your money being stuck in limbo if they won\'t let you pull it back into a currency that is used in one of your attached bank accounts.\nBut, hey, at least I can convert to EUR or GBP, which are completely useless to me at this time.\n\nIf you will use Wise at all, follow this advice: *NEVER* accept payments via Wise, and *NEVER* send them money via bank transfer of any kind. **ONLY** ever fill your Wise balance with your credit card.\n\nAt least, if you charged with your credit card, you can perform a chargeback if/when they block you from retrieving your funds for "legal" or "regulatory" reasons. Which is a great idea because, as long as\nI have some legal reasons; I can legally cheat anyone of anything, lie to them about it, and still be labelled a legal, upstanding, and regulated company.\n\nYou have **no** way of knowing, beforehand, if your money is going to be blocked from pulling it out in your desired currency. You only find this out after you\'ve already put your money in and try to pull it out again.\n\nStealing money isn\'t theft as long as you\'re, following the law on paper, at least.', 'review_date': '2022-11-17', 'review_time': '20:23:37', 'CompanyReply': 'Reply from Wise\nNov 17, 2022\nHello Jonathan,\n\nWe always strive to give our customers the best possible service, and we really appreciate your feedback.
