These guys actually managed to restore my trust in banking institutions, which is not an easy thing to do in todays’ environment where every bank is just concerned about themselves and tries to squeeze the last drop out of their customers with often incomprehensible fees.\nWISE always responded in a timely manner to questions I had, and international transfers are easy and very fast. And today (11 August 2022) I even received an email from them where they informed me that they will no longer charge me for holding Euros. Here is what they wrote,\n“We always want to provide you with the lowest possible fee for our service. We’re no longer in a negative interest rate environment. This means it doesn’t cost us money to hold larger amounts of Euro for our customers, so we’ve removed the fee to hold Euro in your Wise Account.\nThis is in line with our mission to keep our fees as low as possible and pass as many of our savings to customers. We'll continue to work hard and help you save even more.”\nWhich bank ever reduces or even takes back fees? My trust in WISE has been boosted greatly by this.\nThank you WISE!", 'review_date': '2022-08-11', 'review_time': '20:01:16', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

I tried to send recently and it says the receiver\'s account is "no longer supported". I sent several emails asking why, all I got were generic answers and still don\'t know the reason.

On my current transaction, I couldn\'t send funds on my computer but had to use my phone, and even then, had to try the transaction several times before it would go through. As I write this, I have been waiting for a transfer to be delivered that was supposed to be delivered 4 days ago, I called support & all they could tell me was "it is a technical issue", meanwhile, my recipient keeps asking about their money. So, although your fees are so reasonable compared to wiring through my bank, it\'s been nothing but frustration and a headache.
