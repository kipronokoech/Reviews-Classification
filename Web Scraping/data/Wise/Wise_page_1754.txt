I was also told there is no way to expedite urgent queries which is ridculous. The customer service advisor displayed no empathy and I had to ask a lot of questions to even get the little information I did receive. I appreciate that I need to follow a process, however it should not be so challenging to do so. I am now faced with little choice but to cancel the account that I have just set up since it seems Wise is not able to do an adequate job (all I need is for a transfer to go through within the expected SLA, I'm not sure why it is so challenging).", 'review_date': '2022-05-12', 'review_time': '14:52:40', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
