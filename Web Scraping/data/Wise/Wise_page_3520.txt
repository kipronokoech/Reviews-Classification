The two replies I got were generic and misunderstood, as well as unhelpful. Although cheap to use, I am beginning to consider other options as transfers are not instant (which I had to get the company to admit and amend their advice on the site accordingly!). The customer service leaves a lot to be desired, and seems to have joined the main institutions that outsource their customer service overseas, where employees appear not to have sufficient training and give generic, unhelpful replies. Disappointing.\n\nThe sign of a good company is to listen to its customers and take on board constructive feedback. It is clear to see Transferwise does neither of these things (as their reply makes clear)! I reiterate that customer service emails are cut and paste and do not attempt to resolve your issue.', 'review_date': '2021-02-01', 'review_time': '13:51:41', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nFeb 1, 2021\nHi, Jawed.\nSorry to hear your feedback.\n\nOur customer support is well trained and always here to help if any troubles. Looks like we've advised you over the email and reimbursed the fee by adding it to your balance. All transfers are final from our end though, and it wouldn't just be possible to link together transfers if it's already been processed and sent out.\n\nWhen it comes to transfer speed- we never claim that all payments are instant. It's definitely what we're aiming for, but it does depend on quite a few factors. For example, how you're paying us, what's the route and how long it would take us to convert your money. This can take up to 1-2 working days in rare cases.
