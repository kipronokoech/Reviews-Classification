I have been there customer for 5 years . So be aware before sending a large money as they can hold your amount for 30 days without any reason and you even can’t cancel it. Such a shame . See below response from wise after escalating my issue . WISE RESPONSE: (Thanks for getting in touch and apologies for the delays. I checked your transfer and it looks like we’re running some routine regulatory checks. We sometimes need to make checks like this — it’s one of the ways we keep your money safe. It can take 2-10 working days up to 30 working days to review your transfer — but it can take longer. We’ll let you know when we’re done, or if we need any more information from you. Sorry for the wait — we need a bit more time to process your transfer we cannot expedite the process. Once the review is done for this transfer you will be updated by our relevant team. Please keep in mind that we will not be able to cancel any transfers that are being check by our relevant team, preventing any further delays or pauses in your future transactions with Wise) FURTHER COMMENTS : after posting this review , all of a sudden my wise account was deactivated , which is a very shameful act , they don’t want customers to say the truth . I had 350 GBP in WISE account , I contacted customer service to ask reason for deactivation of my account and apparently they say we don’t know anything and can’t help me . Honestly I don’t care about wise account and want my 350 GBP back . Dear users , I will politely request everyone , not to use wise as they will torture you and will take your hard earned money. There are many apps who treat you as customer and gives you respect .', 'review_date': '2022-10-01', 'review_time': '12:45:32', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
