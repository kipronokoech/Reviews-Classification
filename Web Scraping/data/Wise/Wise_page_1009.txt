Unfortunately, Wise.com\'s IBAN calculator miscalculated the IBAN and I gave the clients incorrect details to pay.\nThe first time I called Wise.com about this, I explained the situation and they advised me to ask the payers to raise this with the support themselves. Since then, my clients have communicated at least 3 times each to have this resolved. I had to get some information from the clients in order to locate the payments and my bank so that they can be rejected. My bank rejected them and still several days later, they are not on my clients\' account. When I tried to talk to someone in Wise.com and avoid having to hassle my clients yet again, they were completely unhelpful. They used the excuse of data protection to be completely unhelpful even though I asked them to just take the information from me and to look into the case and respond direct to the payers but they would not do this. Honestly recommending this way of paying to my clients has given me so much difficulty and around 2000GBP in total that I am still trying to get back after almost a month. The supervisor I spoke to would not not even give his full name, but said he is just "Mark R".', 'review_date': '2022-09-29', 'review_time': '11:11:58', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
