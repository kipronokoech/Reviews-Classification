I made 3 transactions on March 4th 2022, the transactions had to be reviewed by WISE, why? I dont know, originally it stated it would take 4 business days to resolve, well it was resolved yesterday, 1.5 months later and after me blasting WISE on social media and even issuing an official complaint to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Yesterday WISE finally decided to cancel my transactions and return the money within 10 day... So, after them holding my money with no explanation why, not letting me talk to anyone other than the customer service personnel (which apparently all they can do is escalate the case, they did it for me 5 or 6 times and nothing happened), me being our of twice as much money because I had to send the same amount to my family using a different service whileWISE had my money hostage; WISE will take up to 10 days to return my money....My advice is to not use this service.\n\nBefore you use this service go read my posts on their FB, it includes the chat sessions I had with customer service on different days, you will see how they simply just repeat the same thing and never resolve anything.\n\nAs soon as the money appears on my bank account I will terminate my account with WISE and NEVER USE THEIR SERVICES AGAIN.", 'review_date': '2022-04-21', 'review_time': '20:24:47', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
