They claim it is because they "violate international sanctions" laws which is a total lie and BS!! How do they violate international sanctions laws if the money is from a registered UK bank account like Barclays, Lloyds and others??!!\n\nFurthermore, they ask for personal details of the payer, such as DOB and Residency, when clearly the transfer is from a UK Bank Account. Once they even told me to pass on personal details for the person that my customer used as a Reference! How obnoxious is that!!\n\nWe are an online, tuition provider and our customers (mainly parents) use children\'s names as references, as per our protocol, to track their payments with us.\n\nThey need to revisit their legislation on their banks as even high-street banks do not have such strict rules, and Wise is just a digital bank.
