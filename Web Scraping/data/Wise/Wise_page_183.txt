I opened an account yesterday with Wise after paying all fees and was shocked to receive a notification stating that my account would be closed on September 11th, despite having just opened it.\n\nAs a new customer, I chose Wise based on their reputation and the convenience they promised. I provided all the required information during the account opening process and made sure to comply with their terms of service and policies.\n\nHowever, I was left confused and frustrated when I received the account closure notice without any specific reason provided. This lack of transparency is highly concerning, and as a consumer, I deserve a clear explanation for such a drastic action.\n\nI reached out to Wise's customer service team seeking clarification and a resolution to this issue. Regrettably, I received generic responses that did not address my concerns or provide any meaningful assistance. The lack of support and communication from Wise is truly disappointing, as it goes against the trust I had placed in their brand.\n\nI strongly urge Wise to reevaluate their account closure procedures and enhance their customer support system. It is crucial for a financial service provider to prioritize transparency, accountability, and effective communication with its customers.\n\nI hope that sharing my experience will serve as a cautionary note for potential customers considering Wise's services. It is essential to be aware of the potential issues that may arise and the inadequate support provided by Wise in such situations.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read my feedback.

We understand that having your account closed can be frustrating, and we want to assure you that we'd never do this without a reason. We take the security and integrity of our platform very seriously, and account closures are only done when there is evidence of activities that violate our Terms of Use. You can read them here: https://wise.com/terms-and-conditions\n\nDue to regulatory reasons, we may not always be able to provide the exact reason for the account closure. However, if you believe there has been a mistake, once the account is fully closed, you can appeal our decision by following the guidelines outlined here: https://wi.se/accountdeactivation_. After you submit your request, we'll review it and get back to you via email ASAP.\n\nIn the meantime, if you still have funds in your account, we recommend withdrawing them before the closure date to avoid any inconvenience.\n\nWe've also emailed you on July 13th with more information about your case and the next steps. Please double-check your inbox for the details.\n\nAbout your experience with our customer service team, we're sorry that you felt the responses were generic and didn't address your concerns effectively. We're constantly working on improving our customer support system, and your feedback will be taken into account as we continue to enhance our services.\n\nIf you have any other questions or need help, you can always reach out to us here: https://wi.se/contactus_ or find us on Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram.

Unfortunately, the experience has left me frustrated and feeling undervalued as a customer.\n\nMy adventure began when I decided to establish an overseas company in the United Kingdom using personal earnings from platforms like Fiverr. I then formed the company using the online service provider 1Formations.com, with no physical presence in the UK required. The British government accepted my source of income and address without question.\n\nMy experience with Wise, on the other hand, has been far from straightforward. Despite having provided all necessary information and supporting documents, I was repeatedly questioned about the same issues, making me feel unnecessarily scrutinized and suspected. I understand the need for regulatory compliance and due diligence, but the constant questioning about information that has already been provided seems excessive.\n\nThis situation has a significant psychological impact. Being made to feel like a suspect when trying to conduct honest business has had an impact on my mental health. I've put in a lot of effort, time, and money into this process, and the constant roadblocks have only added unnecessary stress to my entrepreneurial journey.\n\nWhile I understand and respect the importance of financial regulations in preventing illegal activities, I believe there is a need for balance, understanding, and a degree of trust in customer relationships.\n\nUnfortunately, my experience with Wise has been disappointing. Excessive scrutiny, combined with an apparent lack of trust, has tainted my experience significantly.\n\nI sincerely hope that Wise will consider this feedback and improve their service, making the process more streamlined and less mentally taxing for others who, like me, are simply trying to expand their entrepreneurial ventures overseas.", 'review_date': '2023-07-13', 'review_time': '15:26:03', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
