On top of that, the recipient\'s bank charged an additional USD 10. Overall, I paid more than 10% fees while expecting to "being wise while saving with Wise". I do understand these charges were not made by Wise but by one or both of the banks (though there\'s no record of such a fee on either my US bank or the recipient\'s EC bank.) But I *DO* complain about Wise not notifying about the upcoming charges which would have led me to make a better informed decision.
