We don\'t make this process difficult for you nor we make you wait for any reason. If the "cancel" bottom is available there, it means you can cancel your transfer at anytime. If not available, it means your money was already sent out and therefore it can no longer be cancelled.\n\nWhen you cancel a transfer, the refund won\'t be made available right away. That\'s because both us and your bank, will need to work on it. However, we\'ll always share with you the estimate delivery time right away. If you\'ve paid us by bank transfer, the refund can take 3 - 5 working days to reach your account. If you\'ve paid us by card, the refund will take up to 10 working days. This isn\'t because we\'re using your money for other purposes, but because a refund needs to be processed.\n\nAll the best,\nWise Team.', 'CompanyReplyDate': '2021-06-24', 'CompanyReplyTime': '10:39:05'}
