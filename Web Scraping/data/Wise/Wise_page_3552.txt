So, this situation forces us to use other alternatives such as Payoneer or similar third party services.\nI\'d found nice reviews about TransferWise last year, then I decided to give it a try.\nAfter opening my account \'n submitting all required documentation, I proceeded to open one account in USA with 20 dollars.\nTwo days later, I\'d tried to log-in into my account to check details, but it showed up one alert: "Your account was suspended". I was shocked for a moment due to there was no notification or alert on my email about it. They must\'ve alerted me bt any suspicious activity on my account if they were one true serious service.\nAnother issue which annoyed me is one user must contact the support service after suspension, but they don\'t know the true reason behind the account\'s suspension (it could\'ve been hacking, suspicious activity or any other reason, but I still don\'t know). Besides, I didn\'t know I must\'ve appealed my suspension first in order to claim my account\'s funds (after suspending an account, they should have one button on their website to claim all user\'s funds directly). Tbf, this part wasn\'t a big issue cuz my 20 dollars returned in 48 hours. Even though, I had to read one tutorial about what to do after one user\'s suspension on TransferWise before I complete this final task. The main problem was resolved, but they still should improve how to handle one account suspension...', 'review_date': '2021-01-16', 'review_time': '12:48:48', 'CompanyReply': 'Reply from Wise\nJan 22, 2021\nHey there.\n\nWe understand having your account closed is frustrating, but rest assured this is never done without a reason nor this is a decision we take lightly.
