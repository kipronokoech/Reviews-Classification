In order to get account details, Wise required me to send $20 to my account.\n\nI accidently sent it from my old, closed account. Then I cancelled that transfer, and Wise in turn initiated the refund. They (supposedly) refunded money to my closed account which does not work anymore. Then they get a message from the bank (where I have my closed account) that my payment failed. Then Wise deducted 20,03 USD from my Wise account.\n\nHere is the message I got from Wise:\n\n"The 20.03 USD payment you made by bank debit failed. So we‚Äôve taken that amount off your USD account, making it go negative."\n\nActually, when you send money to a non-existing account, it bounces back to you. So, Wise was supposed to get back the amount they sent to a non-existing account.
