I like using it. And I love that it works with Hubstaff.\nBut the logistics can be complicated.\n\nI had people I hire use Wise and EVERY single one of them had issues setting it up (for those who are not in the US, there\'s selection for "In the US" and "Out of the US" that they need to choose--they always choose "out of the US" because they don\'t live in the US. But they need to choose "In the US" because MY account I pay them from is a USD account...it\'s so unnecessarily confusing and there\'s no way to figure it out unless you fail and call the customer service rep to figure that out. EVERY single person I brought to Wise had issues setting it up and took weeks to set it up).\n\nWise needs to do a much better job at explaining to people from different countries the best way to set it up.\n\nAlso, Wise changes its rules for wiring funds without sending out an email to inform us, which meant when I recently wire funds it didn\'t go through until I called Wise and realized they changed rules for how you wire funds. I lost 2% on conversion rate because of that (It took me an extra week to get the funds and the conversion rate went up).\nWhen Wise change rules about how to wire funds, they really should send out an email to inform us.\n\nAlso, I find that not all the customer service reps on the phone are informed and knowledgeable about their own service. I\'ve been told things that I know are not correct and I had to correct the customer service reps.\n\nI think this is one reason why it\'s challenging to set things up. You may be told something that\'s not actually true, and fail at setting it up, and then call back again and luck out and get a customer service rep who is knowledgeable, and then finally set it up correctly.\n\nHowever, once you set it up (It\'s an arduous journey), it\'s great. It works well and makes it easy to transfer funds between people in two different countries.', 'review_date': '2022-02-04', 'review_time': '14:17:43', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
