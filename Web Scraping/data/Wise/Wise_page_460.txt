Actually the majority of our transfers already are there. However, in a real world nothing is perfect, so delays happen from time to time. It could be because the transfer was set up closer to the weekend/holidays, or because we needed to carry extra checks.\n\nYou can read about it here: https://wi.se/howlongdoesatransfertakes\n\nIf you need help with your account, you can always contact us here: https://wi.se/contactus_ or Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram with your email and user number.
