I read about wise somewhere and looked them up. They seemed legitimate so I thought it would be a great idea to have a card already enabled for foreign transactions while traveling abroad. Initially everything seemed just fine. I set up my account, submitted the required documents, my account was good to go, then ordered their debit card. I got a welcome email, then got the email saying "Good news, we\'ve confirmed your personal documents!"Then I got an email saying, "Your card is on the way. Bye bye bank fees, hello world." Then all of a sudden I get another email saying "Sorry, we couldn\'t verify you with that photo," and that since I had notified them I wasn\'t a US citizen, that I would need to confirm my identity with a driver\'s license, national ID, or passport that was issued outside of the US. But I never made any such "indication." I contacted their support in an attempt to fix the issue, told them I am a US citizen and sent them my drivers license again, then my passport info. Then, though I registered with my proper date of birth, they emailed me stating that I provided a different date of birth. So I contacted them again stating my correct date of birth, which was clearly on my driver\'s license, and my passport. Then I got another email from them saying they\'ve closed my account, and that they don\'t tell people the reasons for closing accounts. They did provide info on the appeal process, which I tried, again with all the same, correct, info. I provided pictures of my state issued driver\'s license, a picture of me holding my license, my passport. Finally my appeal was denied, again with no reason why, only a note that their terms of use agreement allow them the right to deny or accept any new user or transaction at their own discretion. So... you can be 100% legitimate, provide them with ALL your sensitive, real personal info, get accepted for an account, approved for their card, only to get it 100% reversed and then be denied. Based on this experience I can Not recommend Wise at all, and have to say do Not give them your personal info, complete driver\'s license info, or passport info like I did. As now I\'m stuck with the, OMG... these people have ALL my personal info, dilemma. Yeaaa, I\'ve Never run into Any conflicts on Any other banking type service. I was approved for the account because I provided All the the proper credentials. Since all my information is real and verifiable, after submitting my driver\'s license, front And back, a pic of me holding my driver\'s license, And my passport, I was then also approved for the wise hello world debit master card, which was the reason I signed up in the first place thinking it would work great for international transactions, and while traveling, it was even shipped, and I just got it on 8/21/21, it\'s sitting right in front of me as I update this review. Be careful people! This company will approve you, ask you for all your sensitive data, then once they get all your data, they will deactivate your account for no legitimate reason, and this is exactly the way their business model is set up. Since they have no legitimate reason to actually give me, they just drop the claim that they reserve the right to terminate my account, and not give any reason. I can only give you the truth about my personal experience with this company. What legitimate company receives their clients identifiable information, reviews that information, asks for more identifiable documents to review, then approves you after reviewing them, asks for those documents again when you ask for their debit card feature, reviews all the documents again then approves you, only to then cancel your account with no reason given?', 'review_date': '2021-08-24', 'review_time': '09:45:21', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nAug 24, 2021\nHello there,\n\nDeactivation can happen for a few reasons, but because of the way we're regulated, we can't share with you the exact reason why.
