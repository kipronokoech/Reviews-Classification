I initially opened two business accounts and a personal account with Wise, enticed by the convenience and transparency they promised.\n\nHowever, my experience took a turn for the worse when, after just a month of usage, all my accounts were unceremoniously canceled without prior notice or warning.\n\nOne of the most infuriating aspects of this ordeal was the lack of transparency from Wise regarding the reasons for account closure. I was left in the dark, forced to speculate about what could have gone wrong. Wise said it was related to their terms of service, but I am almost certain I never violated them. The absence of concrete information or communication on their part only added to the frustration.\n\nThe consequences of this abrupt account closure were severe. I lost all access to my accounts, leaving me only able to track my funds if I had meticulously documented them elsewhere. The lack of account access was inconvenient and raised serious concerns about the security and trustworthiness of Wise as a financial platform.\n\nTo make matters worse, Wise promised to transfer my funds to an account of my choosing within a reasonable timeframe, which they claimed to be less than two weeks. However, in my case, this turned into an exasperating two-month ordeal. Only after numerous emails, tweets, and other forms of communication did Wise begin to process my fund transfer.\n\nWhat truly baffled me during this process was the need to provide my account information on 4 occasions. This delay and inefficiency in processing the transfer only exacerbated my frustration and made me question the reliability of Wise as a financial service provider.\n\nMy experience with Wise has been nothing short of a nightmare. The sudden and unexplained account closure, the prolonged delay in fund transfer, and the lack of transparency in communication left me deeply dissatisfied. I had high hopes for Wise, but this experience has shattered my trust in their services. I recommend that anyone considering Wise as their financial platform exercise caution and be prepared for potential disappointments.', 'review_date': '2023-09-29', 'review_time': '16:00:48', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
