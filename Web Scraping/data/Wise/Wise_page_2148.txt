However, then received an email asking for more info about the reference I used (my first name and house name - pretty logical for money being send to a builder). Responded back to Wise on 23 Feb (which they acknowledge) and yet still on 01 March transfer in the Wise portal is showing 'some checks are being made' - Wise having now had my money for 7 days. Customer services, whilst polite and articulate, said nothing could be done to accelerate. Asked for a customer compliant form to be emailed to me, guess what no compliant form arrived! Quite clearly Wise is under resourced for a payment to be held up for so long even accepting a 1 day national holiday in Estonia. The FCA needs to determine whether under resourcing is a systemic issue and if so what is being done to address.
