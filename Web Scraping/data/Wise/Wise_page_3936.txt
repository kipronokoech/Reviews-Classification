So I googled and found lots of glowing reviews of Transferwise. I suspect they are buying these.\n\nThe transaction was supposed to be quick, I was using my credit card for safety and the link said I'd get the first one transacton free but actually got charged 50p but not worth complaining about but that should have been the first red flag...but then I got a message it has been delayed due to checks and this might take a day. Annoying...and now they have suspended my account with no message or email to explain,\n\nAnd to 'appeal' I have to send a selfie with my photo ID to a strange company? That's illegal btw, passports cannot be duplicated and should not be send over the internet. Really insecure and dangerous, but also given the shady fees and the rest, I'd not trust them with anything.\n\nAvoid!\n\nEDIT: I see Transferwise has responded - this is the first contact I have had since this happened 6 days ago. I resent the suggestion that my transaction - which was buying a fountain pen from a company in India - was somehow illegal or against ToS. I actually successfully sent the transaction via WorldRemit, who although wanted to verify what it was for, I did so via chat and it went through successfully. They didn't deactivate my account without even an email!\n\nAlso how can you 'reach out' to the Appeals team without sending them your ID? That's what happened when I tried. All I have is a passport and that's really shady sending a 'selfie' with your passport, it's illegal to duplicate a UK passport. And given what they did, I don't trust them with data like that.\n\nStill avoid!\n\nEDIT 2: The pen arrived today 3rd November, so I don't know what Transferwise's problem is, but they flag genuine transactions by reputable companies as false.", 'review_date': '2020-11-03', 'review_time': '18:25:34', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nOct 26, 2020\nHi Tim. Account deactivation isn't something we take lightly. It can be a result of a conflict with our ToS or a discrepancy with financial law. We know this can be very frustrating that we can't tell you why it's how the law works.\n\nWe explain that in more detail here: https://wi.se/account-deactivated.\n\nReaching out to our appeals team is the way to go as we from the customer support side can't see your account details anymore. They will get back to you within 10 business days with more details, so make sure to keep an eye on your emails.\n\nThanks\n\nJoao\nTransferWise", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2020-10-26', 'CompanyReplyTime': '15:31:45'}
