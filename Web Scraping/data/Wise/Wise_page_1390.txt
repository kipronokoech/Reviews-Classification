They require documents from banks, that banks cannot supply. They don't seem to have knowledge of the Canadian banking system. If you are abroad and need to use their services, it will be impossible to get your money. Also, there is ZERO customer support. None of their phone lines seem to work or have more than 1 hour wait times. Their teams don't get back to you if there's an issue with your transfer until well after the date that your locked-in exchange rate expires. So unimpressed, will never use their service again. With so much more competition on the market, you think they'd provide more support.", 'review_date': '2022-07-18', 'review_time': '21:02:40', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
