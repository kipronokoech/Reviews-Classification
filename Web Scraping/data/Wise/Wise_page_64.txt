We can't always share the exact reason for the deactivation, due to how we're regulated.\n\nIf you think we’ve made a mistake, you can follow these guidelines to appeal our decision: https://wi.se/accountdeactivation. We’ll review your request and get back to you ASAP via email.\n\nIf you have remaining money in the account, we'll work on sending it back to you.

That was the biggest mistake opening account with such a fintech company which dnt care about their customers. I highly recommend to not trust on such good transaction or conversion rates scams if in end they give u pain. Its not worth it. They even don't care of u hv some meidcal issues or traveling abroad.
