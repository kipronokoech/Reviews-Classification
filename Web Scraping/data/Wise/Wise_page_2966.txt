However, something happened this week that definitely changed my life thanks to Wise's disappointment. I tried to make a transfer for a German visa application and not only they did not let me proceed, but they withheld my money and closed my account. It was supposed to be something simple and fast (just as they promise) from IBAN to IBAN. Now not only I have a financial loss, but they ruined my life projects by losing the opportunity to apply for the visa at this time. No one deserves this level of uncertainty and anger. I always recommended their services but now I can only tell my experience to each of these people inviting them to close their account to avoid future inconveniences.\n-------\n\nDesde que inici√© siendo cliente, siempre tuve buenas experiencias. Sin embargo, esta semana ocurri√≥ algo que definitivamente cambi√≥ mi vida gracias a la decepci√≥n de Wise. Intent√© hacer una transferencia para una solicitud de visa alemana y no solo no me dejaba proceder, sino que me retuvieron mi dinero y cerraron mi cuenta. Se supone que tenia que ser algo sencillo y r√°pido (tal como ellos prometen) de IBAN a IBAN. Ahora no s√≥lo tengo un perjuicio econ√≥mico, sino que arruinaron mis proyectos de vida al perder la oportunidad de poder aplicar a la visa en este momento. Este nivel de incertidumbre y enojo no lo merece nadie.
