They promise to look into it and do nothing. Wise doesn't care that they've totally disrupted my business. I've got suppliers refusing to supply and staff who can't buy food or pay their rent. Disgusting service.\n\nI've offered to help with due diligence - no response. I've offered to pay for their agents' overtime to complete it (if they don't have the resources to keep up with their workload) - no response. What do I have to do to get my business operational again? - no response. Disgusting!\n\nMy response to Wise’s reply…\n\nHaving to comply with financial regulations is not an impost that is unique to Wise. What is unique (based on my experience with several financial organizations) is Wise’s incompetence with how they treat their customers during the compliance process. I’m confident the law doesn’t require Wise to totally disable businesses in order to carry out routine due diligence. An apology for their incompetence would have been the least they could have done.\nFootnote: It’s important to acknowledge that in my experience, every other aspect of Wise’s business and service is excellent. I’m very surprised and disappointed they can’t at least acknowledge their significant shortcomings when it comes to compliance.", 'review_date': '2022-05-25', 'review_time': '15:43:47', 'CompanyReply': 'Reply from Wise\nMay 24, 2022\nHello Brad,\n\nPlease mind that any regulated financial institution has the right to carry out compliance related checks in order to confirm who is sending/receiving money and why. This is to ensure that Wise is safe and secure for everyone on it.\nAs processing these checks is a legal requirement and therefore cannot be avoided, we have the following section in our Customer Agreement agreed by you upon opening of your Wise account: https://wise.com/terms-of-use\n\nVerification is how we keep your business’s money safe, and comply with the financial regulations in the countries we operate in. We do everything we can to make it quick and painless, but we also need to make sure your business meets our acceptable use policy, and that’s why this process can’t be rushed and at times will take a little longer than we first expected.\n\nWise', 'CompanyReplyDate': '2022-05-24', 'CompanyReplyTime': '09:24:40'}
