As for the debitcard functionality that comes with the Wise multicurrency Card, I have found it failing me on approx half of all attempted direct debit trxs - most annoyingly, I have never received any explanation for these failures even though the account was fully funded. For the last 7 weeks or so, even the payment services have become uttely unreliable for unexplained reason. multiple instances of Cross currency wires, both outbound and inbound, have been held in limbo ( Either not cleared, or not reaching destination) for 4 weeks, with Wise claiming this was a routine check on each one of my pending payments - even after one cust svc rep indicated they would never hold customer funds for more than 14 working days. It took claims filed with both FSA and Ombusman - in multiple jurisdictions (after multiple request to their Customer Support team yielded neither answers nor resolutions) to get them to reverse the transactions that were held up. So after a 4 week wait, I am back to square one, less significant excess costs I had to shoulder for alternative wires, not to say anything about even larger opportunity costs I had to bear. Most annoying is the fact that after all this, they fail to furnish any credible explanation as to why this failure went unattended for a whole month. When things go well, payments are smooth, but when these hitches start to pile up, their claim to transparency runs dry very fast. I had reasonably high regard for their services for the first 3 yrs but after my latest series of experiences, I am not sure I would trust Wise to carry out any payments that have a definitive deadline, or for that matter, trust their debit cards to work the way they are supposed to. Very unfortunate as the basic value proposition was attractive, but execution and transparency (when things start to go wrong) is sorely lacking.', 'review_date': '2022-06-03', 'review_time': '14:15:32', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nMay 25, 2021\nThanks for sharing your feedback with us.\n\nIt's never our intention to cause delays, but as a regulated financial institution, there are times we need to carry extra checks on a transfer.
