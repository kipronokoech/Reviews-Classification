I was then quite reasonably asked for details of the source of funds and immediately sent over full details of the sale (contract, deed of sale, solicitor details and details of the funds being paid to my UK Bank euro account).\n\nYou would think this is sufficient but Wise are also asking me for proof of income, which I have provided though this is not relevant as I confirmed that I only have UK income and this is not the source of funds - the only transfers to Wise were to be from the property sale.\n\nThe whole website, transfer process etc I find confusing with no human interface. I am left with my €5,000 in limbo at the mercy of a shifting conversion rate with the only communication from Wise being that they are reviewing details and that they will contact me if further information is required (what or when I have no idea).\n\nReally not great - I have since gone elsewhere for a further tranche of my sale funds (Tor fx) and thankfully this was a much quicker and hassle free process. I’ve already had €100,000 converted whilst my initial €5,000 already sent to Wise languishes in no man’s land.

We understand that this can be frustrating, especially when you're eager to make transfers. We appreciate your patience in providing the requested information.\n\nIn your case, you've mentioned that you only had funds from the property sale to transfer, and that's valuable information. However, regulatory requirements can vary depending on the region, and in some cases, we may still need to verify your source of wealth, which includes income.\n\nHere we explain what we look for in these documents: https://wi.se/sow\n\nOnce we have the information we need, we'll do everything in our power to complete the checks and get your money moving.\n\nYour feedback about the user experience is also important to us.
