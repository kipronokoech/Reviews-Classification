Gives the impression that it will be quick when in reality it can be multiple days. 2) Poor usability and gaping holes in functionality. If you ask me to upload my documents, then your document uploading system should work and provide a confirmation that the upload was successful. I should also be able to see what I have already uploaded and correct it if needed. 3) Don't send me an email confirmation that you've confirmed my documents if you really haven't! 4) If you're going to write to me from support, allow me to respond to support, otherwise, you're just wasting my time. 5) If you have chat support functionality and say someone will be with me within 2-5 minutes, then I shouldn't have to wait 20+ minutes for someone to show up. As it stands I'm still waiting for someone to respond via chat.

However, after you have set up your transfer this could change for a few different reasons. For example: you might have set up your payment over a weekend/holiday, you might to be finish verification or we might need to carry extra checks on your transfer. No matter the reason, we'll always make sure to keep you updated via the app, but with emails as well.\n\nThe documents you have uploaded won't be available to you on your account, but you'll get an email confirming your account is fully verified.\n\nAs for communication, if we send you an automatic email you won't be able to reply to that. But when supports or verification reaches you, you're always able to reply to those emails. If any questions, you can also find our contacts here > https://wi.se/contactus_.\n\nWe do appreciate you sharing your feedback with us, and we'll make sure to work on anything that can be improved from our side in order to better your experience while using us.\n\nAll the best,\nJackeline\nTransferWise", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2021-01-18', 'CompanyReplyTime': '19:05:51'}
