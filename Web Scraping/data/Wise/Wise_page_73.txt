What if they arbitrarily ask for additional documentation? What if they take months to review that before they release the payment? I\'ve heard horror stories of people facing this issue with Wise, so I enquired with Wise customer support to see whether my concerns were unfounded before I start fully using my Wise account.\n\nNearly one month later, the only thing of substance I received from Wise is a link to an article that provides examples (but not guarantees) as to what kind of documentation might – and I repeat, might – be accepted by Wise to prove source of wealth.\n\nI read the article and it says that service agreement contracts are not accepted if it only shows the hourly wage. It has to show "the pay period and total amount". What about independent contractors that don\'t work fixed hours, then? For those persons, the service contract may only show the hourly rate, plus the maximum number of hours they are authorised to work each week.\n\nI gave Wise an opportunity to explain this and the only response I received was from Leigh, who is a Complaints Officer, to confirm that they need more time to respond to my complaint. Apparently, I filed a complaint even though I didn\'t.\n\nIn any case, no one from Wise has responded since. They have not yet exceeded their self-appointed deadline of 35 calendar days (which was originally supposed to be 14 calendar days), but the deadline is fast approaching, and it has been 19 days since I received a canned response from Leigh.\n\nThe issue is simple: without my salary, I can\'t pay my bills. I don\'t think Wise fully appreciates or understands the way people work in the 21st century. Many of us work remotely on an independent basis, not actually being employed in the traditional sense.\n\nConsumers have the right to expect some level of predictability from a financial institution like Wise. If they pause an incoming transfer, I should have clear knowledge of precisely what documentation they would reasonably require and how long it may take for Wise to process it and release my funds. Alas, they\'ve provided nothing but opaque answers.\n\nI\'m not sure I can trust a financial institution that behaves like this. The fact I have not received any resolution to a simple query for almost one month does not fill me with confidence if I had an actual problem with my Wise account, such as a transaction dispute or paused payment.', 'review_date': '2023-09-24', 'review_time': '17:42:47', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
