We could. It was a no brainer to switch.\n\nUnfortunately the joy was short-lived. We are discovering that the accounts Wise once permitted payments to are now no longer supported. Meaning, you can't make payments to councils and a range of leading banks and credit card companies.\n\nIn short, Wise is becoming only useful for basics like converting cash or holding foreign currency.
