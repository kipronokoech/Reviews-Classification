Initially as have a daughter in New Zealand and used it for transfering money to her. More lately have a Wise card and use it on trips to Europe - just so good and basically like having a Euro current account. Works brilliantly whether just getting cash at ATMs or contactless payment. Looked at several options and have never found any other that offers better value and the process and app is so easy.

They have no proper customer support department, they lag consistency and are very rude. I received my payroll into my wise account directly from the bank, from where i used to send money to my spouse back home. Only 1 recipients and the same merchant bank paying funds. They closed my account once the funds arrived, depriving me of my own hard earned money and keeping the funds hostage without any notification. They deactivated my account, never asked for additional information or paperwork. Customer support does not have any answers to my problem, they can not refund my money neither can they escalate the issue, ranting on twitter was useless since they asked for 10 days to issue a refund. We currently stand at day 26, no replies, no response, no refunds. They have my entire salary and my family awaits their general living expenses. PATHETIC.

We ever only close accounts that are being used in a way that goes against our Terms of Use: https://wise.com/terms-and-conditions\n\nWe hear your concern, but rest assured your money is safe. When an account is closed with balances on it, we need to carry due diligence checks first. Once these checks are completed, we always get in touch about the refund.\n\nWise', 'CompanyReplyDate': '2022-05-02', 'CompanyReplyTime': '10:54:06'}

This is to ensure that Wise is safe and secure for everyone on it.\nAs processing these checks is a legal requirement and therefore cannot be avoided, we have the following section in our Customer Agreement agreed by you upon opening of your Wise account: https://wise.com/terms-of-use\n\n‚ÄúVerification checks may increase the time for processing your transfer order. We carry out verification checks, and these checks may increase the time it takes to process your transfer order. We cannot be responsible for any delays as a result of carrying out those checks.‚Äù\n\nThe time it takes for a refund to get paid back into your account depends on a number of things. These include the way you paid for the transfer, the currency you paid with, and how long your bank takes to process refunds.\n\nWise', 'CompanyReplyDate': '2022-05-02', 'CompanyReplyTime': '10:50:20'}
