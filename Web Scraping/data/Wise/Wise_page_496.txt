I have concluded they do not disclose methods and practices to anyone (I have found this to be not uncommon in the FinTech Industry). The revised Anti-Money Laundering Act (AMLA) requires financial intermediaries to comply with much stricter due diligence duties as of 1 January 2023. I think this Act is a good thing to identify unlawful subjects. However, it is my experience they have excessively restricted the process to render it almost unusable in my experience. This is NOT a good thing. I do not think this was the intent of the law but indeed it is what resulted. Broad brush strokes of governance are easy to implement but are rarely effective and often harmful. Someone needs to correct this messy implementation of the law soon.
