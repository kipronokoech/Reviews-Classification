My UK bank shows this as a Wise request for sum to be transferred? In other words seven pounds above the transfer sum I requested was in fact taken using my debit card details. I know that your transfer fee is very good, was this extra seven pounds actually debucted by my bank for transferring UK pounds to your Bank in the UK? Your answer to this query will be appreciated.
