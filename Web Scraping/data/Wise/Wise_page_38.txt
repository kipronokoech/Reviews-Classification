It helps us combat money laundering, and keep everyone’s money safe. That way we can continue to provide even faster, cheaper and more transparent service for you, for everyone.\n\nThat's not all – we also have different regional regulatory requirements. Which is why we might need to ask more – or different – questions, depending on where you move money to or from, or where you live.\n\nWe know this is personal information. So we try to ask you the least we can, to still complete all the checks. We always store your information securely, in line with our privacy policy. You can check it here: https://wi.se/privacy_fb\n\nTo sum it up, we're here for you and your money, but we want to do it safely and securely.\n\nShould you have other questions, reach out to us at: https://wi.se/contactus, or on X (Twitter), Facebook, or Instagram.
