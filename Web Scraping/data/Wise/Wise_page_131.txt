That way we can continue to provide even faster, cheaper and more transparent service for you, for everyone.\n\nThat's not all – we also have different regional regulatory requirements.

However, my recent encounter with them has left me utterly disappointed and questioning their integrity.\n\nAfter successfully setting up my business account and receiving a legitimate inbound transaction of $9500, I was blindsided by Wise's sudden decision to deactivate my account without any proper explanation. Despite providing them with all the requested information to verify the transaction's legitimacy, they not only failed to respond promptly but also kept me in the dark for an entire week.\n\nWhat is most concerning is their complete lack of responsiveness. My attempts to appeal through their website proved futile as the appeals process seemed to be non-functional. I sent numerous emails to the wise appeals email address, hoping for a resolution, but I received no response whatsoever.\n\nThe fact that Wise would deactivate an account without clear communication or due process raises significant questions about their commitment to their users' financial well-being and security. It is alarming that they would jeopardize a client's trust and business reputation by treating them with such disregard.\n\nFurthermore, the unexplained withholding of my legitimate funds, coupled with their lack of communication, has led me to question whether there might be deeper issues at play, potentially suggesting fraudulent practices on Wise's part.\n\nI urge anyone considering using Wise to exercise caution and think twice before entrusting their money and financial transactions to this platform. A company that fails to address legitimate concerns, unilaterally deactivates accounts, and exhibits such a blatant disregard for their customers' financial interests raises red flags that should not be ignored.\n\nIn a world where online financial security is paramount, Wise's actions have left me not only without access to my rightful funds but also questioning the authenticity and reliability of their services. I hope my experience serves as a warning to others who might be considering Wise as a banking solution.", 'review_date': '2023-08-14', 'review_time': '13:18:44', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nSep 8, 2023\nHello Nathan,\n\nWe hear you and want to let you know that we don't take this lightly.
