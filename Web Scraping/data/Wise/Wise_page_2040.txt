If you’re sending a larger amount, we often have to do extra manual checks, which can take longer. Also depending on how much you send, we might also need to check how you got the money for this transfer. And we might ask to see some documents as proof.\n\nWe make this process as fast as possible, but we know sending large transfers can be particularly stressful.\n\nPlease mind that any regulated financial institution has the right to carry out compliance related checks in order to confirm who is sending/receiving money and why. This is to ensure that Wise is safe and secure for everyone on it.\nAs processing these checks is a legal requirement and therefore cannot be avoided, we have the following section in our Customer Agreement agreed by you upon opening of your Wise account: https://wise.com/terms-of-use\n\nWise', 'CompanyReplyDate': '2022-04-21', 'CompanyReplyTime': '12:20:14'}
