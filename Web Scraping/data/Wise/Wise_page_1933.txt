A ticketing system is good for bugs, not for a fast response. But even in a ticketing system, you can send quick and informative responses to a customer keeping him informed that things could take a few days to resolve, instead of ignoring their request. You can read multiple messages reporting what were the transactions legit and what not and avoid blocking accounts. You can pick up the phone or any video chat tools to better communicate with the customer in real-time.\n- Security Response: block all the accounts involved including my Fiance account, without any communication for her, for days, without any response, and taking days to restore the funds. My 8-month-old daughter and my 4 years old daughter say "funk you" for not having any money to buy milk, food, put petrol in the car, and not being able to take visiting grandparents out for dinner, because our account was frozen.\n- I understand blocking my account to put it in safe mode, but having the account of my fiance blocked, was nasty. A person that is just a regular Joe that is not from any branch of the government that suddenly squeeze your life considering that you are just a number without pondering any implications of his actions is just scary Orwellian and surreal.\n\nI hope that this story can reach Wise and give them some stimulus to change into something better. Wise enjoy the bad press, as much I have enjoyed all the problems you have created.\n\nFor now, I move all my money to 2 different banks that cannot be blocked by a single person, just in case.\n\nToday the fees spent by the transfer made from the scammer are still not refunded, the email that is asking for it is answered, more than 17 days are passed from the scam, 7 days from the last response to my messages of request the refund and the transactions of the account.', 'review_date': '2022-04-07', 'review_time': '12:01:28', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
