The app is really easy to use which shows all your balances in each currency clearly. Exchanging money is so simple with fees clearly shown before each transaction is made, so you know exactly what you will receive. If you use FX companies, then move over to Wise.

Next day, contacted support again, promised to get back nothing. Third day, the app was saying my payment was declined and that they need more info and that they sent an email - nothing. Contacted support - they promised to get back and hey!!! they did saying they had a technical issue. Then came back again saying the payment was reverted and it takes up to 10 days to refund. Only next day I got an email saying the money is sent back but still no money...\n\nso overall, if they fail with your payment, your money is lost for days! 9 days in total!!\n\nEdit: re wise reply.
