Furthermore, the "Contact Us" page on the Wise website did not contain any way to contact Wise. Notwithstanding, I was able to locate the Wise contact details on another website that was not affiliated with Wise. I called Wise and reported the problem but never received any further response from Wise nor any explanation of why the problem was occurring. Rather than placing the burden on the customer to contact Wise again, four weeks later, I recommend that Wise check its own records for my description of the problem.
