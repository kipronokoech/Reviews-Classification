It’s taken about 106 more days (15 weeks) to get those remaining funds. From the day I opened the account, there was also an issue with service delivery estimates that were consistently not met. Finally, although all monies have now been returned, there was no compensation for the funds “confiscated” for 5 months. Overall, it’s been a highly negative experience.

But first, we need to carry out due diligence checks. While we do that, your money and information will be safe and secure".\n\nAlthough wise has claimed I violated section 12 of the user agreement, but I\'ll proof to them that I did not.\n\nSection 12 of wise agreement says the following;\n\n\n"1. If we do not reasonably meet our commitments to you, we are responsible for loss or damage you suffer. We are not\nresponsible for any loss or damage that is not foreseeable.\n\n2.

Transferwise is to compensate me for making me to suffer getting my funds that is rightly due to be given to me which was on my account. Transferwise had no dispute in my funds\n\n2. I didn\'t use my Tranaferwise account in a fraudulent way or misrepresentation. Even when Wise asked me to hold my ID and send a selfie with a piece of paper writing Wise 384, I did it and hence there was no misrepresentation because Transferwise already verified my face in the app before approving a multi-currency account for me.\n\n3. I didn\'t use my personal Wise account for business purpose.\n\n4. My computer was not affected.\n\n\nWith my explanation above, I have proven to Transferwise that I didn\'t violate section 12 of the user agreement as they claimed I did.\n\n\nOn 19/01/2023, I got an email from someone in appeals department by name "Laura" demanding for my selfie holding my ID card and a selfie holding a piece of paper writing Wise 384 on in order to process my refund.
