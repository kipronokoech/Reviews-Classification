Some banks are faster than others, but this isn't something we can speed up from our side. Do keep in mind as soon as the money is sent, a PDF receipt is made available.

Turned out both that I could not transfer directly, then that the amount I had transfered did not hold the expenses to TW for the extra transfer from TE to the Indian account. So I needed to do one more transfer from my Danish account to TW and blindly gues on the cost for the transfer to the Indian account. Then make the transfer from TW to the Indian account. It would have been useful if I could have transferred directly or immediately get the cost of the double transfer so I could have just done one transfer to TW and then one to the Indian account.\n\nAlso there is a pop up what we save on using TW.
