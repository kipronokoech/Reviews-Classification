If someone sent you money to your Wise account, we can't see it until it arrives – when it does, you'll also see it in your activity list.\n\nWe try to move your money as fast as possible, but how long it takes to receive money into your balance depends on the currency you're receiving. Read more about it here: https://wi.se/howlongpaymentsbalance\n\nIf you haven’t got the money within the timeframe specified for your currency, first check with the sender whether they used the correct account details.\n\nIf you’d like us to take a look, please send us a proof of payment, so we can check it. This can be a receipt, bank statement, or a screenshot from an online bank showing:\n\n- sender’s name and account details\n- your name and account details\n- date they sent the money\n- amount they sent\n\nAbout our phone lines, it's never our intention to seem unresponsive – you can always reach out to us here: https://wi.se/contactus, or on Twitter, Facebook or Instagram.

Last month, despite following exactly the same process we always do, Wise took GBP from our English account which they converted to EUROs before converting back to GBP to send to our French account who promptly charged us an huge fee for converting GBP to EUROs at an appallingly low rate. We have therefore been charged 3 times to convert the same funds from GBP to Euros (twice by Wise and once by our French account).\n\nI contacted Wise to ask why they didn’t send Euros as expected and was told they would investigate but the email I received this morning from ‘customer support’ is shocking - very dismissive with no plausible explanation or apology, just a statement advising the mistake is mine. Unfortunately the response failed to take into account this was a regular transfer and the whole point of using Wise is to convert GBP to Euros at best possible rate. If I wanted to send GBP to a French account I would do so directly and not pay Wise’s fees!\n\nThis has really put me off using Wise. As many others have found, they are great until something goes wrong, and if something does go wrong their customer service is shocking.
