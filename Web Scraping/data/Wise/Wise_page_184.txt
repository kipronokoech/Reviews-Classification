It is not fit for purpose anymore.\n\nOur business accounts with more than $600K in them have been blocked since June 27th, that\'s 13 working days, for a computer-generated review into a potential sanctions violation for dealing with Sudan. We do not and have never sent money to, or received money from Sudan. It was on our website as it is a diving destination in the Red Sea, and we sell dive trips, but not from Sudan.\n\nOur ability to function as a company has been impacted severely, I have to use personal money and credit cards to pay suppliers. I have run out of options. Every message from the useless Wise Support team says they have highlighted the urgent nature of the case to the review team, it changes nothing.\nFirst I was told 5 working days, Then 10. Now maybe by the end of the week (that would be 14). It is impossible to have contact with anyone with any power to do anything. They hide behind "we are experiencing a high number of transfers to check"... Their business volume has grown, but their staffing levels and/or competence to deal with the growth clearly haven\'t. And "as a financial institution, we have to carry out checks". Whilst true, and a good thing, they do not have the right to block accounts for this long, there is no statutory legality behind it, and in any case is an incredibly poor customer experience.\nNever trust Wise with your business if you want to be able to operate properly.
