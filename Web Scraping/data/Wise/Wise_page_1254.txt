When they stopped my payment to verify transfers, in the account ot Said will be in account at 10:36 today. I look today and they, took away the time it was supposed to get to me. To then tell me when I call ,that it will take 2 working days to verify. When I asked if that means my money will be with me by tomorrow, the person ain't trying to answer me. I just want to delete my account and get my money out....also the customer service person kept on ignoring my questions and when I asked to speak to a manager.

Duly paid my fee but it took weeks to set up because the validation team do not understand a business that has no need for a website ( I was purchasing a property abroad for an Airbnb). I needed wise to transfer my £ into Euro and pay ongoing fees and services. Not only did that take an eternity, nearly losing me £30k in deposits via an aborted sale, they blocked my other business from using them meaning that I really struggled in paying my staff and contractors that are abroad!\n\nCustomer service cannot influence anything and despite my repeated requests I never got to speak to a manager. Only one of the CS (from America) staff really understood the issue and admitted there was little they could do due to a validation team in Estonia. All other CS staff were actually quite thick and could not understand that I did not need a website for my property and that I could only list the property on Airbnb once I had completed the purchase.\n\nTalk about the tail wagging the dog!', 'review_date': '2022-08-11', 'review_time': '12:56:20', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
