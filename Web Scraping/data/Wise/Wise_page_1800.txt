Keep getting told to do same thing (send receipt to receiving bank). Done that and no trace. Then told to wait (it's already 9 days since they took my money). Answered my first email but then no follow up. What now? Raise a dispute. Will update this if the situation changes. This does not make me want to use them again I am afraid. Just being honest.

On the sender's side, the payment is displayed as successful. But the money did NOT reach me. I checked the details, they are correct. I sent several requests to Wise support a week ago including a receipt from the sender, where the transaction number and other data are indicated, in your form it was written that the answers come in 1-2 business days, but no one has contacted me yet. You bothered to answer the sender of the payment, apparently because he is a business client, but for some reason you blatantly ignore me. You told the sender that Goldman Sach held the money. Okay, whose partner is this, mine or yours? This is not my bank, this is your partner. Can you finally contact your partner about this problem?! Wise employees or Goldman Sach did not contact me, I did not receive the money, the money was not returned to the sender. And what should I do in the end? Outcome - scam?? Which one of you, Goldman Sach or Wise?\n\nI'm very dissatisfied with your service that didn't even contact me after several inquiries and doesn't try to fix the issue with Goldman Sach. I am not a millionaire who has time to wait for his money for a long time, besides, I have a war in my country and complete uncertainty, in addition, you have lost or frozen my money somewhere. Please contact your partner, let him at least return them to the sender's balance if he does not want to approve the payment to my balance. Otherwise it is a scam from you or your partner.
