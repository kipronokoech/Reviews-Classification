I didn\'t find out about that for three days when I was asked to provide ID.\n\nAs the payment was, by then, urgent I paid it by other means, and then instructed Wise to cancel the transfer.\n\nHowever I had no access to the funds, and when they were finally "returned" to my Wise account I was unable to withdraw them initially until said ID was provided. That was not even requested from me for 4 days.\n\nCommunication is pitiably slow. The time between instructing the apparently successful, but failed, transfer, and the refund to my bank when I was finally able to withdraw the funds was 19 days.\n\nPrior to that everything worked well, the app is fine, the website is fully-featured, and I had used it for months with both buiness and personal accounts.\n\nThe account is now closed.\n\nMy complaint regarding these matters was replied to with a formal response absolving Wise of any responsibility to do anything in any particular timescale.\n\nI can understand the need for certain checks to be performed however that transfer was to a payee to which others had been made successfully before, was of a low value, and was reported on-screen to me as having succeeded. If this happens, you\'ll have no access to those funds until Wise\'s bank elects to put the funds back in their account, which has nothing to do with the end-customer whose money has temporarily disappeared into the ether.\n\nIt is not an alternative to using a bank and I would not recommend using it to store any significant sums of money with which you cannot afford to be without nor to make any payment which needs to arrive within any particular timescale and which, if it fails, you cannot pay another way in the meantime while you wait for Wise to refund you when they eventually get around to it.', 'review_date': '2021-03-19', 'review_time': '12:31:29', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nMar 23, 2021\nSorry to learn you didn't have the best experience while using us, Mark.\n\nWhile we aim to offer you the best experience while using us, and complete your payments as fast as we can, we're a regulated financial institution and carrying extra checks on transfers is something that we must do from time to time.

Anyone who thinks this ‚Äúwon‚Äôt happen to them‚Äù scroll at all of these reviews. How many of us thought this as well. If you read their user terms of use, it says this: Wide alone will determine whether there has been a breach of this Acceptable Use Policy through your use of our Services. They can, UNILATERALLY, foreclose your account. THEY DONT NEED TO TELL YOU, they just do it. Hell, they don‚Äôt even need to return it if we didn‚Äôt have FCA regulation to ‚Äúprotect‚Äù us regular users.\n\nWe don‚Äôt read the small print and blindly trust their marketing spiel. But look at what happens when we don‚Äôt read and trust, they close your account balance without warning (enticing you to add money to your account might I add) and then lock ALL OF YOUR SAVINGS UP. READ THE SMALL PRINT NOW BEFORE TRUSTING ANY NON-BANK with money.]\n\n[EDIT: ENTIRE ACCOUNT CLOSED WITH MY MONEY SITTING IN IT] DON‚ÄôT put money in it. Similar to what people say below I had an experience where for no reason whatsoever being entire account got frozen but it doesn‚Äôt tell you it got frozen so you continue to cancel and then re-add money in but that also means you are transferring new money in!\n\nThe real scam is that they don‚Äôt tell you it‚Äôs frozen and they hold your money for days on days on end and drip feed any requests for your identification which by the way you have already technically provided! There‚Äôs no way to just say cancel and then get your money back because even then it takes at least 10 business days when you were holding such a huge sum of money! Don‚Äôt use it anymore!\n\nNow I am pathetically waiting for someone to even respond to me and just refund my own money back! When you called customer service they refer you to a very tiny little font in page whatever saying that they have the right to freeze your account whenever they want! For a bank that supposedly prides itself on transparency, If you have to refer to tiny legal wording that you‚Äôve obviously failed your customer in communication! The least they could‚Äôve done was to show in big bright letters that your account is being frozen so you don‚Äôt keep adding money into it! But of course they are greedy and they want you to continually add money into it so that they can charge you more fees!\n\nIf this were a bank everyone would go crazy and it would make the news! But as it is wise who constantly treads the gray area of not being a bank when it suits and being a bank when it wants to, no one bats an eyelid.\n\nI‚Äôve been using like others transferwise for years and it‚Äôs been smooth until it‚Äôs not.
