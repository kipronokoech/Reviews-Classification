The only reason I took 1 star out is because when you click on "Repeat transfer" to do the exact same transaction you previously had, it keeps all settings of the previous transaction BUT the "way to pay", changing it to the most expensive option. So you did read all the fine prints the first time, chose a way to pay that generates lowest fees, than decide to do the exact same transfer via the "Repeat transfer" button, this time you don\'t pay attention, since everything seems the same, and you get applied the most expensive option, instead of what you chose the first transfer. You need to manually change that. Obviously not illegal, but that\'s not a professional way to treat your customers. I found out months after using the platform and felt pretty disappointed about it.', 'review_date': '2021-09-10', 'review_time': '20:51:58', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
