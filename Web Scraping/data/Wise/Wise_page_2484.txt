I have made transfers before in two different currencies, at various times and days of the week. I have always been given at least 48 hours to get the money into their account. This time I was given 12 hours, and because the account number was new, my bank took longer. They went through with the transfer when they received the money but sent less than the agreed amount without even checking with me. I think they should allow at least 24 hours for the transfer, preferably more, otherwise you can never rely on the amount that you are actually sending.', 'review_date': '2021-12-03', 'review_time': '22:04:23', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nDec 28, 2021\nHi, Jan.\nThanks for sharing your feedback with us.\n\nSounds like your money took longer than expected, to reach to us. Please note, that this isn't something we can control from our side- but it depends on your payment method and currency you're sending, for example.\n\nHowever, whenever you set up a payment- we'd offer you the quaranteed rate (2-72 hours, depending on the currency). It's calculated out to make sure that whatever payment method you'd choose, your money would reach us within this timeframe.\nHere's more:https://wise.com/help/articles/2448203/whats-a-guaranteed-rate.\n\nIf your money would get to us later, we'd need to apply the new mid-market rate. Rest assured, we're always transparent from our side when it comes to the pricing and fees.\n\nTo give you some better answers about your payment, kindly reach out to us at:https://wi.se/contactus_.\n\nWe'd be more than happy to look into this for you.\n\nBest wishes,\nWise.", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2021-12-28', 'CompanyReplyTime': '17:08:17'}
