The time it takes for a refund to get paid back into your account will depend on a few of things. For example, the currency you paid with, and how long your bank takes to process them.\n\nGenerally it can take anywhere between 1 and 10 working days depending on the payment method used to pay for the transfer. Running checks, is part of a standard process for all banking services.\n\nPlease reach out to us at https://wi.se/contactus or on Twitter, Facebook, or Instagram, we'll take a look at this.\n\nWise", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2023-08-31', 'CompanyReplyTime': '14:57:49'}
