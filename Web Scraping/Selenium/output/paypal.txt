PayPal seem to have a low cost offshored call centre in Asia with agents who cannot answer a direct question. They simply blamed the food company and said nothing we can do. No help as to how to prevent this type of illegal fraud.\n\nWhat I was told was that there was an “active billing subscription” with the food company. So I checked all of these active subscriptions on my PayPal account, and lo and behold, there are lots of them. It seems when you pay by PayPal you are also agreeing to let the vendor bill through PayPal whenever they want by agreeing to have an active billing subscription.\n\nHaving been a PayPal customer for over a decade, my account is now closed.

I couldn\'t beleive that I would send the item to another country, I checked the address on Google Maps and it was a regular house in Luxemburg, it didn\'t look like an office. I contacted eBay Germany and it was very strange they said. I Contacted PayPal several times and they tried to force me to send it to Luxemburg, until last day one agent gave me "correct" address in Germany. I sent the item back to the seller, the package never arrived and was sent back to me because of wrong address.\n\nBecause the package never arrived, I lost my money and had paid extra for the shipment. PayPal closed the case. I called and told them that I did as they said, it was really hard to me to convince them that I did as they said and followed the instructions in details, it didn’t help. I called several times until one agent took it seriously and went through the files that I had attached; he reopened the case and asked the decision makers to take another look into the attached files. Apparently, PayPal avoided the info I provided them about the track ID and photos of everything and just closed the case. It was then, after the case was reopened and what the agent wrote to decision makers helped me to be refunded.\n\nSummer 2022:\nI purchased a lot of items from a store, one of the items was out of stock and would be shipped later wrote the store, the item costs around €60. And in the store\'s ad they ”promised” one free additional item worth around €40 when a backpack was purchased which I did.\n\nI received everything except the item out of stock which was expected, and the "free" addtional item was missing. The store said it’s only for local customers which the didn’t mention it in their ad. I claimed that to PayPal, the store first agreed to refund then asked to send back the items that I purchased. PayPal asked me to send back the items worth around 500€ to get my 100€ for the two missed items (the one I paid for and the free one). I asked them to read the conversation between me and the store which I had attached, they refused to do it. I told the agent about previous case in winter 2021 that was reopened, it seems your are not browsing the files that I\'m attaching? The answer was no, the case is closed, contact the store instead.

Terrible customer service. Long waits to speak to anyone. If you don\'t want to call and want help through their message center, don\'t bother, I repeatedly got disconnected from messaging. They DO NOT listen to you. They lie; for example, I used the 6 month financing and my extra payments always gone towards the special finance purchase, then all of a sudden it didn\'t. They said they only do that when it is a month before the promo rate ends. That is a lie because the way I used it, I wouldn\'t have been able to pay it off in one month since I used it for big purchases. I would always make my minimum and then a large amount to pay towards the promo purchase each month for 6 months, every time any extra would go to my promo purchase balance. I called and a rude representative lied to me and said they never had it set up that way and disregarded anything I had to say to him, he gave zero *ucks. Honestly, it seemed like a joke to him, like he enjoyed being disagreeable. I stopped using their credit because this seems very scam like if you ask me. Trying to make a buck by tricking people into interest rates, I\'m all set.\nAnyway, separate issue, I am on hold for an hour now because I can\'t use messaging center, it\'s a waste of my valuable time, the first representative would not listen to me. I repeatedly told him that I sent my daughter $60 two times, and since PayPal would not let her deposit it from PayPal to her bank account she refunded both payments. One $60 charge was deducted from my account, the other was not. The representative kept telling me no, we didn\'t take money out, we covered the charge. Each time I explained to him that I had a $60 withdrawal from PayPal the day after I sent it to her. It was as if he didn\'t listen to me at all because he would repeat the exact same thing like a script "we did not deduct the funds, we temporarily covered the charge for you." Apparently two separate transactions and two refunds was entirely too much for him. I asked him to connect me with someone who would actually listen to me, so here I am waiting and waiting and waiting because of their faulty system and incompetent reps. I\'m canceling my account.

We've taken the decision to pull the plug and remove Paypal from our website.\nWe bust our balls to give good customer service. We ship all orders promptly and in most cases everything runs smoothly. Very occasionally Royal Mail deliveries are delayed or even lost. It's a fact of life and nothing we can do about it. Because most of our deliveries are free (to the customer), we don't use a tracked method so we need to allow Royal Mail up to 10 working days for delivery. This is what Royal Mail allows before an items is considered lost. If the item is not delivered within 10 working days, we'll issue a full refund or reship, depending on the customers wishes.\n\nUnfortunately thought, despite all this information being in our terms and conditions and despite the fact that UK Consumer law allows up to 30 days for delivery, Paypal allow customers to raise a dispute at any time after the order is placed and actively encourage customers to escalate it to a claim. Why would they do this you ask. Well it's because Paypal now charge £12.50 for every claim made against a merchant.\n\nWhat this means is that a customer can raise a dispute just a couple of days after placing an order, immediately escalate that to a claim without any time allowed for us to respond and try to resolve the issue and even if we issue an immediate refund we will be charged £12.50. You just can't win. Paypal are extorting money from UK merchants and it's no wonder that they have removed themselves from the Financial Ombudsman Services Voluntary Jurisdiction. I guess they don't like being charged when customers complain about them.\n\nI guess Paypal are desperate to claw back the money they are loosing when eBay ditched them.\n\nTo all merchants out there. Get rid of Paypal. They are no longer relevant in 2022. It's easy to get a proper merchant account and payment provider and I can assure you that customers that want to buy your goods will not leave just because you don't accept Paypal.\n\nAs a customer these days, I rarely use Paypal (even if a merchant offers it).

Avoid a bad time, a waste of time and bad attention: DO NOT USE PAYPAL', 'user': '632c69566dc14a00131fba7a', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

It’s extremely easy to lose money when using PayPal. There are countless horror stories on the Internet about it. Just look at all the one-star reviews here on Trustpilot! Page after page after page of one-star complaints. PayPal is thoroughly despised!\n\nThe only time I use PayPal is when I have no choice. That is, sometimes my credit card won’t work for a certain merchant, which forces me to use PayPal. I had to do that a couple of weeks ago.\n\nThere are so many security issues when using PayPal, a book could be written about it. First off, to link your bank account, they want your bank’s login and password. That’s insane!! Luckily, I’m smart enough not to give out that kind of information to anyone. But PayPal pushes very hard to get it from you. So I have to assume the majority of people do it. They probably trust PayPal to keep it secure. (All those poor suckers will one day regret having done that.)\n\nAs far as them having my credit card number, I delete it as soon as my transaction is complete. Although I’m sure a talented hacker could get all that information anyway. It’s not like PayPal erases it from their records when you delete it from your account. I am a computer expert by profession, having worked in various financial institutions for over 40 years. Trust me when I say you should be very careful with computer transactions; especially where your money and identity are concerned. Don’t give your bank account number to anyone, because doing so risks hackers one day cleaning you out.\n\nPayPal offered me five dollars to open an account. But to get that money wasn’t worth all the hassle. You can’t just spend funds in a PayPal account with a PayPal transaction. Oh, no! That would be far too reasonable. Instead, you have to specifically transfer the money directly to your bank. That’s where the risk starts. Linking PayPal with your bank account is a very risky thing to do. To be cautious, I have a separate account at my bank for risky transactions. I keep only one dollar in it, except when I need to use it. Last month, some hacker tried to withdraw $65 from that account. Luckily for me, my bank rejected it. That’s a perfect example of why I keep a special account to give access to outsiders I don’t trust, like PayPal. Should anyone get that information, I can only lose the one dollar kept in the account.\n\nAs for PayPal, the instructions on their website don’t work. Instead, they pressure you to open all sorts of crazy accounts. You wind up going in circles trying to find out how to get your money. Take my advice—be very careful whenever you use PayPal.\n\nI was finally able to transfer my $5 to my bank account, but was forced to use their app on my iPhone to do so. I’ll be closing that bank account after I get my five dollars. When PayPal has that bank account number, I know it’s no longer safe to use.\n\nPayPal was started by the same crooks that created eBay. In my opinion, both were created by criminals, for criminals. (The kind of white collar criminals who never end up in jail where they belong.)\n\nIf you value your identity and security, stay away from PayPal.\nFar, far away!', 'user': '4b7a52610000640001023bb6', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

They had a good buyer protection policy that was clearly articulated, and it was reasonably easy to contact them when things go wrong.\n\nNot so any more. I have had several issues with them recently, but at the heart of all of those is the utter impossibility of communicating with them in any sensible grownup manner. Like many online platforms they have started using an automated chat-bot, which is almost always completely unable to resolve your issue and drives you up the wall by sending you around in circles. And if you aren\'t able to resolve your issue with the chat-bot easily it resorts to repeatedly just saying "thank you" - over and over, ignoring your further attempts to activate its issue recognition software.\n\nApart from the diabolical and completely pointless and time-wasting chat-bot, there is no way to send them a message or an email. So, if you are unlucky enough to have to work for a living (as most of us do) and do a job that doesn\'t allow you to spend an hour on the phone during the day trying to resolve a Paypal issue (as many of us do), and don\'t get home until late evening due to a commute or busy work period - you are stuffed.\n\nWhen you do finally get to speak to a human you are already at the end of your tether.\n\nI wish I could say that Paypal is the only place that this has happened, but it seems to be commonplace these days and I am guessing that it\'s due to a combination of staff shortages, greed and incompetence.\n\nDear Paypal - most of your customer\'s work for a living, so try making yourself available at a time that they are. And if you can\'t deliver then don\'t offer the service. If you don\'t have the staff then cut something back until you reach a level of business where you are able to provide an adequate customer service (as every small business is having to do right now – only the greedy incompetent multi-nationals are arrogant enough to think that they don’t need to do this too).

I recently used it to fundraise money for the first time. Before I did this I rang customer service, explained I was a novice and told him what I wanted to do, and asked him to help me set up my account.\n\nI successfully fundraised the money, went to transfer it to my bank account, when I discovered I needed to first register my bank account, which would take several working days. I was on a tight timeline and the customer service agent hadn't told me I'd need to do this, or helped me do it that day on the phone with him.\n\nFor me a marker of good customer service is that the person you're speaking to knows what you don't know and can proactively assist you to navigate their service and set-up everything you need to.\n\nSo at the 11th hour I tried to link my bank account. However my bank (Swedbank) has an account number that didn't fit into the field on their website. I rang customer service again and the agent was like 'oh yeah well you need to link your bank account obvs' and then when I told him my problem he said 'oh is it Swedbank? Yeah so you need to just enter the number minus the first two digits' or something like that. And I'm thinking like, why don't they have a drop-down menu where you enter your bank name, at which point the programme recognizes your bank and therefore how many digits your account number will be, and changes the 'enter account number' field accordingly?! Like, do I need to wait over an hour on the phone for someone to tell me how to do it like it's a secret club or something... just seems like SUCH an inefficient system.\n\nIn the end I luckily was able to borrow the money from a friend at the last minute.\n\nThat was a couple of months ago. Fast forward to today and I had some money to transfer PayPal->Bank and I got caught in a verification loop. I rang customer service and she's like, oh yeah we know, it seems to work in the mobile app tho. I explain I'm maxed out on my mobile storage, but wonder out loud whether I can download the PayPal app for my MacBook via the App Store. She's like 'oh yeah sure do that'. I look (with her waiting on the phone) but can't find it there, she's like 'oh yeah it'll be there'. I google it and discover they have the app for mobile and iPad but not MacBook. I tell her this info and say 'this could be good for you to know too'. I'm just... flabbergasted at how incompetent and powerless to help the customer service is.

I filed for a refund through Paypal and then suddenly 15 days later I get another email from Paypal saying that the deadline for escalating my claim was yesterday and now it is impossible to reopen the case.\nI received NO email from Paypal warning me that I would need to escalate the claim within a certain amount of time or else I would lose all right to get my money back. Apparently in the first email I received from Paypal confirming that I had filed for a refund if I had scrolled to the bottom I could have read that I needed to escalate the claim before 14 days or else all was lost. But even if I had read that (which NO ONE reads) it still did not say that you can ONLY ESCALATE A CLAIM AFTER 7 DAYS! So was I supposed to have logged on to my Paypal every day to see if today was the day that I could finally escalate my claim?? This is obviously a way for Paypal to trick their customers into not realizing that they need to "escalate" their claim, by not telling you when it\'s even possible to escalate and also by putting the escalation deadline (which is IMPORTANT INFORMATION!) at the bottom of an email and also sending no warning emails that you are about to lose your right to escalate your claim.\nI thought Paypal was a legit company, but this is scam-like behaviour.

I tried calling them, they picked up the call and made me feel like I am a criminal because I used Paypal for my business. After having talks for 10-15 minutes, they suddenly hung up the call. I tried contacting them again and guess what, they stopped receiving my calls. I tried messaging them on live chat and everytime I got only bot response . I tried mailing few mails on different email addresses i found from internet and again no reply from them as well. THEY BLOCKED ME COMPLETELY.I was no longer able to talk to real person. So I just decided to wait for 6 months because no option were left at that time. After 3 months what i saw is all my held fund was transferred to thief company PayPal and i was left with 0 balance. Again i was not able to contact them. I tried registering a complaint with BBB and waited for 1 month for their response and finally someone from PayPal replied to my concern. They decided to just keep Limit on my account as it is and decided not to give my money back, because according to them I was a criminal who used Paypal for my legit business. So BBB was not able to help me at all. 2 months passed and I logged in my account to remove my debit card and bank account details. I was not able to remove them even after 6 months. I kept getting message to contact customer care, the customer care which was blocked for me completely. So only way to get their attention on my case was to contact via BBB. I filed a complaint and asked Paypal to let me remove my card and account details. Again after waiting for almost 1 month, I got a ridiculous response. They told me that, "you can\'t remove your details because your account is limited and your card and bank details will stay with paypal forever." Literally, wth is this! They don\'t want my business and don\'t want me to use PayPal but they want my card and bank details. SOUNDS LIKE A THIEF. Isn\'t it? Paypal gave me worst experience of my life. Through this whole process I went through lots of reviews from different websites and found that even LLC\'s and Private LTD companies got Banned from PayPal and even their money were stolen by them.\nSo my suggestion for everyone will be stop using Paypal and completely boycott them.

While attempting to login, paypal "can\'t confirm it\'s you".\n\nThis happens several times a month. No attempt by the paypal site to have me verify anything. Just a big "NOPE". So you have to phone them and have the customer service agent verify it\'s you.\n\nWhich means they ask you to confirm things like: credit card number, phone number, address, etc.. What, in effect, they are doing is logging into your account at their end. Why the *** doesn\'t the website let me do that? Completely useless.\n\n2. Trying to link a bank account to a paypal account.\n\nI provide bank account info. with which they\'re supposed to make "two small deposits" to your account. I\'m supposed to use that info to verify the bank account.\n\nI waited days and nothing. I cancel that request and attempt the verification again...nothing. I try a third time and wait 5 days, nothing. So I contact them.\n\nI\'m on the phone for 45mins, the agent assures me that paypal has sent the transactions to my bank, that the fault lies with my bank and I should contact them to resolve the issue. Right.\n\nAfter calling my bank and confirming that, no, paypal has not attempted any transaction or verification process with them.\n\nI call paypal...yet, again. I\'m on with them another 30mins before the agent informs me that they\'ll just verify the bank account at their end and in 24hrs my bank account will be added to my paypal account.\n\n...what!???! At any point in time with me speaking with them over the last two weeks, an agent could have just manually verified my bank account? WHY THE *** DIDN\'T THEY JUST DO THAT TO BEGIN WITH!??!?\n\n3. I thank the agent for their assistance and (channelling my kindest inner Karen) ask if it would be possible for me to, please, speak to a supervisor.\n\n"Sure, please hold while find someone." They\'re gone 1min, "All our managers are on calls right now." No problem I inform them I\'m happy to hold. 5mins later, "All our managers are still on calls. We would be happy to call you back." No, thank you, but I really don\'t have faith that anyone will call me back, because I\'ve done this dance with them before (They won\'t call you back, they deny the customer at any and every step. They wear you down so that you just give up trying and simply continue to let them milk you for fees).\n\nThey keep checking if I\'d prefer them to call me back because everyone is busy on calls. I tell them I\'m perfectly happy to wait on hold, because I have little faith they\'ll attempt to call back. Eventually the agent comes back and instead of the call centre template "All our managers are still on..." they say, "Sir? Sir?\nAre you still there?" Which I am, I say I am, they feign that they can\'t hear me then they hang up.\n\n4. High fees.\n\nOne of the worst in the industry. I\'m just using my credit card from now on. Lower fees and I won\'t have to constantly phone paypal to allow me into my own account.\n\n5. paypal\'s contempt for it\'s customers is barely disguised.\n\nWhile you\'re on hold the friendly recorded message (aside from the "your call is important to us" schtick) continually suggests that instead of contacting paypal, the customer should submit their question, complaint or problem to the paypal community forum and have other paypal users offer assistance.\n\nBecause why should paypal waste time or money to assist customers when other customers can do their job for them.\n\n6. Regarding complaint 1 and 2\n\nEverything that a paypal customer service agent is doing when you\'re on a call with them, is exactly what we the customers should be able to do, on our own, without having to contact them. Every question they ask us and we provide the answer to, they input to their computers to gain access to our accounts.\n\nEverything they do is supposed to suggest that they are taking care of our security and interests, that they\'re needed by us. However, that\'s only because paypal causes so many problems for customers and arbitrarily denies us access to our accounts, that we are forced into begging for assistance.The exact same assistance we should be able to provide for ourselves if their website allowed us to.\n\npaypal is a parasitic blight, milking their customers whilst arbitrarily manufacturing the need for their assistance; which, in fact, is meagre at best, malignant at worst. If I could give it zero stars, I would.\n\nAvoid using paypal at all costs.', 'user': '62e469fe0b24b600121f621a', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

YOUR money WILL be "on hold".\nTHERE IS NO OPTION TO RAISE THE LIMIT YOU HAVE!!\nElon Musk created an amazing company, and the current managers want to bankrupt it (or to downgrade it so much that its value will be very low, for stock market games).\nOtherwise I see no reason to enforce their business clients to go. Because if their business clients go, soon all clients will go.\nI contacted them by phone and via chat and they said "not possible to raise the limit our software put to your company". SO??? No matter if you can prove you are a legit company, with many decades in the business and 12 years in PayPal with continuous activity, their GENIUS software (like the ones who paid for it by using OUR money, and ordered it and the ones who produced it).\n\nSO?? ARE YOU A COMPANY\'S REPRESENTATIVE?? RUN!!!! THEY TAKE TOO MUCH FOR COMMISSIONS AND THEY WILL PLAY WITH YOUR BUSINESS.\n\nI\'m not just angry. I\'M FURIOUS!!!\n\nI have to wait to receive my money!!

With a couple days of setting up my account and receiving my first payment, Paypal permanently limited my account with zero warning, zero explanation, and zero recourse for correction.\n\nThey have been holding my client\'s payment for over 2 months now, and their customer service is, without exaggeration, the worst I\'ve ever experienced. I have sent multiple emails trying to refund, transfer or release my client\'s funds (either back to them or to me) and get the same automated response that "Paypal reserves the right to limit accounts for any reason, without explanation." No other comments on the error messages I get when attempting to transfer the money - no help at all.\n\nAbsolutely unacceptable.\n\nI will never use Paypal again, privately or for business.\n\nAnyone reading this, I advise you to use other forms of payment, like Zelle, Stripe or old school bank-to-bank wire transfer (standard here in the EU still). For international clients, I can\'t recommend Wise enough. Of course, Paypal\'s Trust Pilot score is 1.2 stars, and Wise is 4+. I should have checked before...\n\nAvoid Paypal at all costs. The convenience is not worth the risk. Awful, awful service.', 'user': '62c2aca793d40600137bc6e4', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

I had already provided PP with plenty of evidence that this was fraud -- I had received no emails saying an order had been placed or that merchandise was on the way or that my order was being delivered by a certain date. Indeed, the final receipt showed it was not a purchase but that somehow I had sent money to an unknown individual. But PP ignored all of that. With this second denial, it took a lot of saying "agent" and pressing 0 on the phone to get to a human who said they would actually contact the courier (USPS) to validate. Of course, no one had bothered to double check before the denial of my claim, even as it was clear an individual was scamming me. PP continues to enable the scammers by their lackadaisacal attitude.

I purchased a product and I am demanding a refund because their website also says 100% money back guaranteed. Then in their policy it said if you are disappointed then contact us within 14 days for a partial or full refund. Then it says on another part that they don’t give refunds. So what the heck is it? What kind of return policy is that? So basically their policies are extremely contradictory. Another part of their scam. I am not the only person who had these issues so at least I don’t feel so dumb for falling for their bull. I guess upon further research (should have done that before, I know) there are so many bad reviews about this company. There is even youtube videos on it. The company promised me all of this and of course was giving me the run around. I have been in talks with them for over a week now. I am so frustrated, They just have to issue the refund to my card. Instead of Pay Pal helping me out with this, they made up this response and it makes zero sense. The money wasn’t charged automatically it was still pending on my visa for a while. They claim that I should have done it before it processed and I did. I cancelled within an hour after I realized how much I was charged and that I was deceived. The company responded within that time offering me the partial refund! I should be getting a full refund! Especially after all of this. Now they said to contact my bank… Are you kidding me? I still don’t know why this service exists. I used my visa through them. There’s literally no point. I just thought that I could use this service in case I had any fraudulent purchases. In this case I did! I was literally scammed, I thought they were to be used to protect customers, but I guess they are just as bad as these scam companies. Then when I tried to close my account with Pay Pal because I am so infuriated over this situation, they said they needed their “engineers” to fix the technical issues on their website. I want my account closed now and it says you cannot close your account and you have to contact customer service. At this point I can’t deal with them any further. I reported all of this to my bank in hopes I can get something back. I wouldn’t recommend any of these companies at all. This has been just such a waste of my time. It’s not like they took $15.00 like I thought I was paying. It said $15.00 per month also in the description of payment options. I ended up paying for a six month subscription which was around $95 US, then exchange rate cost me approximately $125 Canadian! That’s a huge difference. Overall, I am livid and I hope that by writing this review this will help someone else. Don’t use Pay Pal!', 'user': '62a2aa008dfd8c00121fda81', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

They were out of stock and had to cancel my order, no biggie. They took the liberty of transferring my refund through Paypal, which was where the problem truly began.\n\nI forget why I even made a PayPal. I think it was for a purchase off of Discogs that never ended up getting to me. I signed up for PayPal so someone could pretty much steal money from me, but that\'s not my issue today.\n\nI had to fight through the most annoying automated receptionist I\'ve ever clashed heads with. The machine asked me for everything I didn\'t have, which was literally the reason I called. I ended up getting frustrated at the machine for wasting my time, and eventually yelled for a customer service rep. After about ten seconds of silence, I was put on hold.\n\nI haven\'t used my PayPal since I started it. The debit card I used as well as the phone number I used are all out of service. I tried to request a new password, but the only option for resetting your password is to get a phone call with a code. Since I used an old phone number, I can\'t physically get my code.\n\nI decided to call customer service. That didn\'t help me at all. The guy asked for the last few digits of the card I had used. I told him that card was cancelled so long ago that I don\'t even remember which card it was. I asked if he could send the confirmation code to my email, and he said the best he could do was to send me the code to my PayPal account itself.\n\nHe tried sugar coating it, telling me that "nobody can touch that money but you". I made it clear that since there is physically no way for me to get into my PayPal account, that money is completely lost and I won\'t even be able to touch it.\n\nI guess there was a very good reason I didn\'t use PayPal.\n\nAlso, make sure if your customer service agent is going to belch on the phone that the customer can\'t hear it.

Well, that alone upset me because there was nothing I could do as PayPal told me that they couldn't cancel the transfer which they were the only one's who could cancel the transaction. However, I go today, June 6th, 2022 to get MY money from MY PayPal account and the money has yet to be put into MY PayPal account. Now, it wasn't like I was requesting money from someone overseas, I was just transferring money from MY verified bank account to MY PayPal account and I still am waiting for MY money on the 6th day during this great electronic and computer age! Mr. Musk you should be ashamed of yourself. PayPal should notify each individual, when transferring money, of the expected time delay.

This same person even said "who do you need to explain this to you for you to understand?", as if I was the confused one.

They are the ones that actually owe me money since they took my money from horrible exchange rate and fees I didn\'t even know about (over $100). She also tried to connect me to her supervisor saying that her supervisor agrees with her, but I was never connected. She said "you\'re welcome" before putting me on hold and just hung up on me. The very next day PayPal credited most of what they took (I guess they looked into it and found what was wrong? I had to spend 5 hours on the phone and chat with them for this to happen though). However, I still had a negative balance because they took more money than refunded. After talking to several different customer service specialists, they offered me a voucher I can use on my next purchase. I just accepted that and paid off the negative balance. I\'m still losing more than $100 though. It\'s just not worth any more of my time to get that money back. PayPal\'s messaging system is a complete joke as well.

PayPal outlined in the email they sent me that I was a high risk customer, but you know what, in reality PayPal is the one who should be tag as high risk, freezing accounts, withholding money with no explanation, no investigation, making accusations and assumptions, impossible customer service, etc. Switch to Stripe, they have better reviews and so far are working fine. Bottom line if you want to gamble with your money of one day waking up and watching your money be taken by an AI and bots, I think it is better to go over to a casino at least here you have a better chance of not losing your money.', 'user': '627a698cad44e300114ddde7', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

I've tried to close my Pay Pal account and they wouldn't let me even though the case is closed. So of course, notified my bank, stopped any further withdrawal, past the case to fraud department and ordered new bank card! All this because I've had an account with Pay Pal and decided to pass my bank details to anyone to withdraw money, set up direct debit and make subscription without my knowledge. They are thieves and I suggest everyone close their account with them if they wanna protect their money", 'user': '5c5c072c28ab24974aae9a2b', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

Their company lacks responsibility and would not help you when there is a fraud transaction!!\n\nI started using PayPal a week ago to purchase flowers for my Grilfriend oversea. I didn't want to use my credit card to pay in a foreign website so I chose PayPal since I thought they would protect my money in case of any fake website scam. So that went smoothly. However few days later while I was asleep at 3AM, my PayPal got hacked and three transactions went through with three PlayStation codes bought through a website called Dundle. There was actually another transaction that was in process to go through but somehow got canceled. After I did some googling, apparently Dundle is a sketchy website as well and a lot of ppl got scammed/was charged without ever heard of the website.\n\nAnyhow, I contacted PayPal to investigate the unauthorized transaction, and they replied three hours later telling me they have reviewed and determined no unauthorized transactions happened. Now my first thought was they wanted to brush me off because an investigation shouldn't be this short... Nevertheless, I later called PayPal to ask for their explanation how they came to that conclusion, and the customer lady said there was no suspicious IP address that had logged into my account (I found out that a hacker with trojan malware can easily fake an IP) and therefore determined no unauthorized activity and all she told me was to call my bank to resolve this...\n\nLet me warn you...PayPal's security is a total disaster, when i queried the customer lady why they don't have otp in place, all she told me was that their system only needs someone to log in to make a transaction... And when I asked her why didn't they catch any suspicious activity when one transaction was stopped but three transactions of the same purchase went through all within 5 mins, and she said that is how PayPal payment works. Also, many people online complained about the company Dundle and how they got scammed/charged on PayPal without ever buying from them, but PayPal took no action over the years to protect their customers from falling into a pishy company like Dundle!\n\nI told her I am going to take this to the local police to investigate and I asked if the police found a fraudulent case would PayPal refund the money. She said their company will have to investigate further to determine, as if the police's report aren't credible enough.\n\nWHAT A JOKE! DO NOT TRUST PAYPAL!

So I opened a second, French account, put in the details of a different card and received a welcome email. But I couldn't use it - I had not been able to enter the (UK) postcode associated with the card because the site was configured only to accept French postcodes - so why no message that the card had not been added?

Here are 5 reasons you need to avoid them:\n1) They don\'t honor what they say - When we tried to switch to Hyperwallet, a PP solution, they approved our application then, after my developers took time to review all the API documentation, they said "sorry, we\'ve decided PP Payouts is a better solution for you," presumably because we pay WAY more in fees with this option.\n2) They hold your funds for WEEKS - Between Braintree (also a terrible PP company) and Paypal, they nearly sunk our software startup by holding tens of thousands of dollars saying "we are waiting on the bank to clear the funds" or "your clients bank has not cleared the funds." Bulls***, you hold the money because you make incremental interest via MM funds and pass the blame off to others.\n3) Their fees are outrageous - They will nickel and dime you the entire way until they\'ve carved out 5-10% of your profit margins with their fees.\n4) I\'ve heard horror stories from ex-employees, along the lines of "it\'s a complete s***show over there." There is no cohesion between PP and the companies they\'ve acquired (e.g. Braintree and Hyperwallet). For f*** sake Braintree can\'t even deposit money directly to Paypal and it\'s a PP solution, which brings me to...\n5) It takes weeks to transfer money from BT to PP. There is simply no excuse for this. Coinbase can instantly transfer money to my bank and to Paypal. Their excuse is "the bank holds the money..." Guess what, you can bipass the banks by going directly from Braintree to PP but you refuse to because either a) you can charge more fees by going indirect or b) you are too unorganized to integrate your own two companies.\n\nThere are plenty of other solutions out there that are more innovative. We are switching to Checkbook.io which seems like a much better, more modern solution for our needs and charges, what we\'ve calculated, to be about 20% of what PP charges.', 'user': '61201891adcfe0001293ed8c', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

They charged me for every donation. So I found out all this after the fact and wanted a normal account. Well it's been horrible trying to get it setup. I have a new email address on top of it all to make matters worse. It's like they aren't setup for complicated scenarios such as mine. I'm to the point that I'm going to stop using paypal and find another service that is easier to use and that doesn't charge me for every transaction and is easier to setup with multiple cards and emails and that doesn't automatically enroll me into a business account based on donations...

I had 3 cards on my PayPal account. The 1st Capital One which they declined. The 2nd would have also declined because that card was closed out. Unfortunately, the 3rd card was my debit card and the $84 cleaned out my account. I have been fighting with PayPal for 4 days. First, they said I had checked the use of my debit card and not my credit card. Sent them proof I used my credit card by attaching copy of the email I got from Capital One. Now they said they are trying to get money back from a fraudulent company in China and I will have to wait until April 6th. I was left with ninety cents to live on. This while episode was their fault, they used a card of mine that was not authorized and now I am being penalized for payPals misdoings. Do not use a debit card with them or better yet, just use your credit card. There is no charges to use it and they respond quickly to any problems.', 'user': '5f5020cfe609061486d7e71d', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

A disability that means I don't conduct anything important over the phone as I have a problem with processing information.\n\nThus, I requested PayPal help restore my account by using any other method of communication besides calling by phone. They wouldn't help me by live chat.\n\nThey wouldn't help me by email. And they wouldn't help me through social media.\n\nInstead they kept ignoring my disabilities and at every opportunity they told me to call them, knowing that that's not possible. Then they said I should give my PayPal credentials to someone else to make the call for me. So PayPal's solution to helping a disabled person access their account is to get that person to give a stranger all the information they'd need to access my business account so they can call PayPal on my behalf. Who in the right mind would do that?\n\nThat's finance 101. Don't give you details to anyone else.\n\nThey could sort it out by live chat or emailing the email on record for my account, but they won't. Instead they prefer this the ridiculous solution of giving my account details to a random stranger so they can steal from my account.\n\nBecause of PayPal's discrimination of the disabled, I've not been able to access my business account for two months. They've effectively stolen my money.\n\nThey should be ashamed of their discrimination.\n\nI just wish there was an alternative to PayPal that is as widely accepted, because then I'd be able to leave these bigots behind", 'user': '561a4d430000ff0001e22750', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

More useless communication between me and PayPal and next the sellers account has been limited so they are unable to do anything. All sounded like excuses and I was at a loss of £68. Trying to get my money back from my bank at the same time, I asked the seller to sort the problem or send the item I’d paid for or I’d have to report as a scam. Next minute I’m blocked and can no longer communicate with the seller. Clearly I caught them out and they were scared. Managed to get the amount I paid from my bank reversed and spoke to PayPal again and after them being completely useless. Finally they took my side and refunded me. However I have still lost the £2.99 conversion fee for sending the money.\n\nPaypal aren’t very helpful at all now and don’t seem to be willing to do much.\nI’ve used it for years but I’m very tempted to completely get rid of it and close my account.

PayPal presented two options to add funds from my bank account one of which it stated would take 3 - 6 days. I opted to log into my bank account via the option PayPal “boldly” presented as “immediate” to complete the transfer. I was then notified that the funds would not be reflected on PayPal until after 3 - 6 business days, so either way 3 - 6 days with my money being tied up.\n\nKnowing the funds were available and having promptly received the text notification from my bank re the transaction I know it was successful. I called PayPal’s customer service requesting that the transaction be canceled and my monies returned as I needed to pay the merchant that day and was told that they weren’t able to do so. I was told to wait the 6 days for the monies to be reflected on my balance with PayPal at which time I can transfer it back to my account and wait another 6 days for PayPal to credit my bank account. Let me not forget to mention that I had to jump thru hoops to find a number for customer service. I even wasted time talking to a “bot” (automated chat) system. Needless to say I’m out of that money for two (2) weeks and still had to find ways and means of paying the merchant. ***but here’s the kicker, the insult to the injury.\n\n***the following day (today) I received a notification from the bank with a 2FA code for access to my account. I wasn’t trying to login to my bank account so I was bewildered to say the least.

On the first occasion I returned an item to a company in Singapore who disputed it had been received, PayPal refused the chargeback claim as they said the item had not been returned (despite evidence to the contrary) - I was able to charge back through my bank.\n\nThe second time I bought a product from a Facebook advertiser who turned out to be scammers, they provided fake tracking details three times and PayPal accepted that as proof of delivery despite Royal Mail's tracking clearly showing the alleged item would have been delivered over an hour away from the correct location. That time, because I had paid using bank transfer, I was unable to chargeback through my bank and PayPal allowed the fraudsters to keep their funds.\n\nSo - you can set up a fake website, use fake tracking details (which you can obtain directly from China Post's website), change your email address every time you contact someone and take your website down within a month or so of it being live... and PayPal will let you keep whatever money you make. They won't investigate you, they won't charge anything back from you, and they won't allow any disputes to remain open so long as you vaguely indicate someone might have delivered something somewhere close to the place you claim to deliver to, within a timeframe roughly in line with their order.\n\nI've since asked to close my account, but because the fools at PayPal offered me an account credit - after I explicitly refused it - I can't close it yet.

It is never as easy as just receiving funds from a friend or sender/buyer. The customer care representatives are very well mannered and kind. I've noticed that they will always help a client as far as their abilities allow them to. However, I still find it frustrating that the issues never corresponding to what has bee. Suggested by the customer care. As of now, I have tried absolutely everything to ensure my validation. I've sent in documents many times over. I find myself frustrated with the fact that I simply can not get my funds because of account limitations and account verifications and buyer/seller verifications ect. And the availability of PayPal customer care is difficult. Because of the fact that they operate within certain hours. I've missed bills and payments to debtors and I'm to answer to them everyday. I wish for paypal to have better communication and to make the platform more user friendly through informative information so that future transactions can be dealt with more efficiently.

Let me explain first. Paypal let\'s sellers abuse and bypass their obligation to accept returned goods. Paypal requires the returned parcels to have a tracking update that either mentions a successful delivery or a delivery attempt, both of which are impossible in many occuring cases. For exampe: once a returned parcel reaches China, the tracking update states: "The parcel has reached the China Customs" - at the same time the recipient (the seller) gets an SMS message asking to declare the newly arrived parcel (this is a worldwide standart, I am sure you are aware of this). No further tracking update will be made for 30+ days - up until the point the parcel gets returned back to the sender. And this is what certain sellers are doing - they are waiting out the Customs storage period to bypass the Purchase Protection and avoid picking up the returned goods / refunding the buyer. I had multiple occassions like this, as well as multiple conversations with multiple Paypal support agents - each and every one of your agents did not provide any help, leaving me with no product and no money.', 'user': '59ef6e1f0000ff000ad90a71', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

THEN, THE NEXT EMAIL SAID, I WOULD NEED TO PAY $250NZ TO CONVERT MY ACCOUNT TO A BUSINESS TYPE AND WAS TOLD I CAN ALWAYS REFUND THE MONEY. I WAS INSTRUCTED TO SEND THE MONEY TO Njukijonh @ gmail. com WHICH WAS THEIR SUPPORT EMAIL. I WAS ALSO TOLD TO TAG THE PAYMENT "FOR FAMILY & FRIENDS" SO THEY COULD PROCESS THE TRANSACTION QUICKER. AFTER DOING THAT, I GOT AN EMAIL SAYING FOR PAYPAL TO RELEASE THE FUNDS TO ME, I WOULD HAVE TO PAY AN INSURANCE FEE OF $850. I WAS TOTALLY SHOCKED! I TOLD THE BUYER, WHO BY THE WAY WAS NAMED, OBAJIMI ADEFIRANYE, THAT I DON\'T HAVE THAT MONEY. HE THEN SAID THAT HE\'LL SHOULDER THE $300 AND I CAN SHOULDER THE $550. HE SAID NOT TO WORRY BECAUSE I CAN HAVE THE MONEY BACK, AND THE SAME WAS STATED ON THE EMAIL THAT I GOT FROM PAYPAL. AFTER THAT, PAYPAL WAS ASKING ME TO LINK MY OTHER DEBIT AND CREDIT CARDS. IT ASKED FOR THE CARD#, EXPIRY AND SECURITY CODE (CVC). I TRIED DOING IT SEVERAL TIMES BUT THE SYSTEM WAS NOT ACCEPTING MY OTHER CARDS, SO I TOLD THE BUYER THAT I WAS HAVING ISSUES. HE TOLD ME TO REPLY TO THE EMAIL THAT I\'VE RECEIVED. SO, I DID. IT WAS JUST NEVER ENDING. I THEN FELT SUSPICIOUS SO I RANG MY BANK. I WAS ADVISED TO BLOCK MY WESTPAC ACCOUNT BECAUSE I MAY HAVE BEEN SCAMMED. I THEN SEARCHED ONLINE HOW TO CONTACT PAYPAL. I WAS ABLE TO GET HOLD OF PAYPAL VIA THEIR MESSAGE CENTER.

{'platform': 'Paypal ', 'stars': 3, 'review_date': '2022-01-23', 'review_time': '22:06:18', 'review_title': 'Beware! Generally Good Experience But Very Hit or Miss!', 'review_body': 'I’ve been using PayPal since 2010 as a merchant and a customer/buyer and haven’t had any major issues. Most of the times, PayPal is generally convenient since they only charge 2.5% + $0.30 per transaction and I often encourage people to pay that way. It saved me a lot of trouble of even bothering selling on eBay (since eBay also ditched PayPal).\n\n1. Customer service seems like they’re mostly based on USA. They speak pretty good English and when you message them, they respond relatively fast (within a day or two). Sometimes it takes more than a few messages to get your point across, but I get it. It’s hard to comprehend every customer’s specific problem so I have no complaints about that.\n\n2. They offer a small credit for “return shipping”. If you purchased your product through PayPal, and want to make a return, they offer free return shipping up to a certain amount per year. I managed to get free returns since a lot of merchants didn’t offer it. All you do is upload your receipt, picture of proof that you’re returning the package and wait about a week for a credit. This has been one of the best features on PayPal for a consumer.\n\n3. As surprising as it seems, I’ve won all the disputes on PayPal (with the except of one). In my case, I was scammed by a few Chinese merchants pretending to be legitimate companies in USA. I submit photos of products not as described, sent in a documentation with details of my experience and problems with the product. PayPal sided with me either forced the merchant to take the return or offer me a refund.\n\n4. They randomly hold funds, freeze accounts or close off your account for no reason. While this hasn’t happened to me, I encouraged someone to sell items online to make money. Her transactions went through and for each one, she had to wait weeks before they were available for her to deposit which was insane.\n\nMy only issue with PayPal was when I sent money to one person who flat out scammed me and even tried to sabotage my business. I sent money ($200) to a woman who said she would promote my product. After I sent her the money and sent her the product, she went back on her word then threatened to write negative comments about me. I tried to file a dispute with PayPal but for some reason, I couldn’t. I had a feeling it was because I paid her with a credit card attached to the PayPal account as default but it was never the case for previous transactions. PayPal claimed I paid with Friends & Family which I don’t recall doing (since this is a business transaction) and I was told if I tried to chargeback with my credit card, my PayPal balance would be in the negative. They didn’t bother helping me then closed off my case. This was one poor experience.\n\nI do recommend PayPal overall, but don’t expect to have a fully good experience as it’s very hit or miss. Some times they will help you, sometimes they don’t. So far, they’ve been generally good to me which was why I gave them 3 stars.', 'user': '570a66290000ff000a161171', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

I have been SO careful over the years.. never ever have I opened PayPal on WIFI that left me naked.. except this time. In a hotel I had been staying in for weeks on a job, I opened my online water bill. IT WAS LATE. crap i opened PayPal and sent.. oh crap i didn\'t you are saying. Oh yes and that was the beginning of the crash. three days later my bank called. have you done this, this, or this. they knew I was out of town but in Chicago.. I was near Montgomery AL. before freezing everything, and I do mean everything tied to my PayPal I authorized a cash withdrawal to be picked up and put on a chime. That thing stays locked as angels in Hades. Then the bank locked it all as I researched the hole. Someone apparently not only got in my account when I was in it.. they were able to keep it OPEN after I logged out. there was no direct access to any cards or my bank but the leak was bad enough. I contacted the bank so they knew to kill all cards and issue new ones.. THEN it was time to dance with the devil. PayPal dug their heels in from the get go. Blaming me, a customer in good standing for... as long as there was a PayPal. Anyway email after email refusing. yes REFUSING to look into it further they closed all of my complaints saying I was online and I authorized the purchases. HrMmm?

Immediately I went from secure the accounts to reject charges. PayPal did NOT like that and started what was borderline threats. I had stripped my PayPal business account of all information could. Everything went and was replaced with old phone numbers and addresses. Now here is where you asked what was the result of my overreaction with my financial institutions. Every SINGLE one of them sided with the consumer vs PayPal. Recently I discovered a long ago and long is like 200 plus days ago order I never received. Again in concise "it\'s all the customer\'s fault" business style that we call Pay\'PAL\' they admonished me in a very nasty i should have done something before the 180 days expired at this point i am not worried about money it\'s gone Karma will have it\'s day.. All i wanted was a nice congenial John Doe we are sorry you have had troubles please tell us more. It may be past the time cut off but at least we can look into the seller and if they are still using PayPal we will keep watch for other complaints... THAT would have been nice. I have had great business with PayPal do not get me wrong but that was at times when I did not need them. Times when business went smoothly and now with Covid still hanging like a smoker\'s cough.. cone men are running wilder than ever after money. Someone in this (business) relationship needs to learn to communicate.. and all of you reading this knows who the over communicator is by now.

I used to think them of being fake comments from competitors, until last week as I encountered PayPal\'s "support" team.\n\nTo start with, I have been using PayPal at least since 2015-2016, and thus passed full verification for using Personal Account. So far I didn\'t have any major problems, until last week.\n\nFor business purposes, I needed PayPal for business account, and thus was checking if I should create a new one or upgrade the current one. I decided to upgrade my personal account as it had long history, was verified, and it was saying that Business Registration is not required to have business account (can act as sole proprietor). And I did so... Immediately my account got limitations on sending/receiving/and all the other possible types of actions - basically became completely useless. And they asked for verification, that included passport, proof of address and business license. Expecting that this will take some time, I asked the "support" if there\'s a way to cancel the requested upgrade, as I need to make payments ASAP using PayPal as there\'s no alternative for me. They said I should instead create a new personal account and I can use it right away without any problems, while they will try to verify business account asap and they DON\'T NEED business license/registration for business account. So I went on and created a new personal account, and guess what? - It got limited immediately, and again I got a request for verification (passport + proof of address).\n\nSo I uploaded all required documents for both verifications - both failed (but remember, that my first old account was ALREADY verified before). Then I provided new proof of address as requested and guess what? - On the new personal account - failed; on the old personal account that I am upgrading to business account - passed. Seriously?!\n\nGuess what happened next? :)\n\n1) Old personal account that I\'m upgrading to business account proof of address got passed, BUT, now out of sudden they require business license, which the website was saying IS NOT NEEDED, and "support" said IS NOT NEEDED, now is suddenly the last step of verification.\n\n2) New personal account which "support" said I can use without any problem - I provided again a new proof of address, and now received their email stating:\n\n"For the safety and security of the PayPal network, we often review accounts for potential risks. After reviewing your account, we have decided to close it because of security issues.\n\nWe are making every effort to minimize any disruption to your business.\n\nIf your PayPal account balance is zero, and you have no unresolved buyer complaints or chargebacks, your account will remain limited."\n\nThat is literally insanity, as because of PayPal\'s misconduct they already caused our delayed payments, thus we will be charged extra fees due to PayPal, or will lose business completely.\n\nNow, seeing all the earlier comments here makes a lot of sense why people hate PayPal so much. We all truly hope this disgusting company to go bankrupt in the nearest future and wish for a good alternative to emerge soon.\n\nWARNING FOR OTHERS: DO NOT KEEP ON PAYPAL ACCOUNT OVER $10 EVER!

I was fortunate enough to win £250.00 in their draw on Sunday 4th December 2021 but only notified on Tuesday 7th December after I had managed to use some of these funds on purchases. Then it went horribly wrong.\nOne of my purchases did not utilise the full funds available and to make matters worse Paypal did not authorise the payment which meant it was technically stuck. As I did not want to pay twice, I had to get the transaction cancelled and it is still showing on my account. To add insult to insury, since 7th December 2021, I have made 4 phone calls and set up a useless webchat with Paypal to a) cancel the transaction their end and b) find out why I have no access to the remaining prize money of £142.15. Apparently, it is a 'technical error' their end which, now a month later is still ongoing. The end date to use these funds was 31st December but someone in an overseas call centre informed me once the 'issue' had been resolved they would honour the remaining amount after this date. It is inconceivable in this age of technology that it has been a huge task to get my funds credited to my account. Excuse after excuse but no real explanation why they messed up.\nCustomer Service has been a joke, not a funny one. I received a 'final response' yesterday advising that they claimed my problem was solved and that the so called advisor had resolved the issue back in December. Clearly no one bothered to read properly or just brushed my credit under the proverbial carpet hoping I would just call it quits. No chance. You offer a prize, you need to honour it.\nIm not sure if anyone else has had issues with these so called prizes but hopefully Resolver will assist and after that Paypal will not be my 'go to' for payments., and I will be cancelling my account.

Because of HOA, the legal representatives change at least once in two years. We always sent in the new information and never had any problems. 1.5 year ago, we start having problems with PayPal that were refusing to accept our documentation. For the last year our account was frozen. Whatever documents we would supply they will not accept and even the accepted ones they asked for again more than once. For example, the management at PayPal could not understand that in Costa Rica the addresses are not the same as in North America. The same address can be written in many ways, like one hundred meters southwest from Banco National or 150 meters north of Coopguanacaste are the same address in Playas Del Coco of Guanacaste province. I spent literally hours with their support people (it was a challenge itself to get someone on the phone) with talking to different people every time. Because our HOA is in Costa Rica the system keeps suggesting calling a T/F number in Costa Rica! How am I going to do that from Canada?! The usual support number disconnects you every time you key in the phone code given from the website. The funny part is that in Costa Rica any information about a business or HOA can be verified online in the national registry for free! I have mentioned it to PayPal support people on many occasions. Finally, after one year of fight I got the HOA account back to normal, transferred all the balance and closed the account. I will be also closing my corporation’s business account and our motorcycle club account with PayPal as I can not imagine what kind of surprise I will get there. I am done with PayPal!

I ordered two 3XL shirt sizes, but one turned out to be too large and the other too tight. Further, the material was shoddy and there were no tags attached to the clothing to suggest how it should be washed. Finally, I ordered 2 RED shirts, but they turned out to be only red on one side; on the other, they were white. So, many problems. I contacted the seller but most of the time my emails were ignored. I then contacted Paypal to file a dispute in an attempt to get a full refund. Today Paypal refused my claim, arguing that: "We\'ve reviewed the transaction(s) and are refusing your claim(s). This decision was made because Buyer Protection only covers item(s) or services that weren\'t delivered or are significantly not-as-described." So, my shirts were delivered and they were red shirts, but as noted above there were many other issues with the product. Paypal never took that into consideration. As long as companies fulfill their minimal obligations, then Paypal will always support them, meaning that you the Buyer will be left holding poor-quality goods as well as being out of pocket.

Because I've had no issue, I've never had cause to interact with their customer services until now. Having just come off the phone, I can confirm that it's mind blowingly bad! So, firstly, I was only on the phone because six messages over two days between myself and the 'help chat' on the app got me nowhere. The replies are obviously from real people for whom English is a second language. Whilst very polite, it's as if they are run through a translation app and the result is very disjointed sentence structure along with a few odd turns of phrase. Anyway, whoever I was speaking to didn't seem to fully understand the problem (an unlinked bank account) and initially said I would need to contact my bank (I was pretty sure this wasn't the case but I did that and the bank were as confused as me) then said I would need to phone in.\nFirst phone call lasted 41 minutes. I was on hold for about two thirds of that time whilst the guy I was speaking to 'investigated that for me'. I don't think my query was particularly complicated but it seemed to involve lots of long holds to check things and then the advisor would come back and say/ask something that we'd already covered or say something completely irrelevant to the issue. I assumed I'd just been unlucky and been connected to the company idiot so, three minutes in to the seventh occasion of being on hold, I gave up, hung up and called back in.\nSecond call I got through to some one who seemed a bit more on the ball but who put me on hold again almost immediately without warning. Then, after some further talking and a couple of holds 'to investigate that for me' (must be a standard line they're told to use every time they look something up) she never came back! Waited 15 mins (the crap hold music is still in my head!) and gave up again.\nSo, I still haven't solved the issue...", 'user': '61b8b7f86b603800122534bd', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

For so many of my transactions they unnecessarily held my money for “security reasons” and offered zero support as to why or how I could fix it. Never hold a large sum of money here if you plan on doing anything like supporting family, paying bills or saving. Because when it comes to finally accessing it, they won’t let you.

They’ll throw out the same generic support script, even if it isn’t relevant to your issue. If you try to follow it up by explaining your issue further, well too late. They’ll have already closed the chat by then, whether they’ve helped or not. From here you’re forced to open another support chat, which will either send you In circles with the same useless script, or say something contradictory to what the previous agent said. While holding £300 of my money, I spent 3 weeks and went through roughly 40 different customer support staff - all of which failed to do anything to help.\n\n•Zero support for scams. I consider myself quite aware and vigilant with scams, I know how to avoid them. Unfortunately, the one and only time I fell victim to one was partly the fault of PayPal. Scammer opened a claim on there saying they never received their purchase from me. Despite having evidence every step of the way to prove this wasn’t the case, they ruled in the scammers favour no questions asked. They took their claim at face value, quietly took my money and returned it to them.\n\n\nI don’t know what happened to PayPal or how it happened.

They don’t care about you as a customer, despite the amount of “we care” or “we value you” lines they drop in their scripts, they very clearly show they they don’t care in the slightest about their users.\n\nI now, just today have got all my money back from PayPal and closed my account immediately after.

The nature of the emails were about his account which was in arrears or didn’t have the correct information or other missteps apparently on John’s part. Why was I receiving those emails? Because this clown, John Deuberry, used MY EMAIL ADDRESS to set up HIS PayPal account!\n\nI tried to contact PayPal every which way from Sunday, but all roads at PayPal lead to: “Please log into your account” in order to send a message. But I don’t have a PayPal account. And there is no way to send them a message if you can’t log into an account.\n\nSo, I called them. And I spent an hour on the phone with one of their completely incompetent employees. He kept asking me for my phone number and address and I kept telling him he didn’t need to know those things. It was his client that stole my email and he should contact this John Deuberry and get the problem solved. After more than an hour on the phone, I was assured the problem would be resolved even though I had absolutely no confidence that it would.\n\nAnd a few days later I get more emails addressed to John Deuberry at my email address. Next I emailed Dan Shulman, CEO of PayPal. I laid out the problem. I got no response what-so-ever.\n\nAfter that I wrote a snail mail letter to John Rainey, CFO of PayPal. No response.\n\nYesterday, December 7, 2021, I used Facebook Messenger to send my complaint and I actually got someone to respond to me. But he/she could not understand my problem. What the actual ****? Then another person jumped into the fray and she seemed to understand the problem. She told me to write an email using the email account John Deuberry commandeered to unsolicitedemail@____ and describe the problem in that email. Because, I dunno, I forgot to tell someone at the company what the problem is.\n\nAnd . . . oh, you’ll love this . . . moments ago I got an email addressed to John Deuberry at my email address asking him if he authorized a change to his email. OMG!!! John Deuberry has not received ONE SINGLE EMAIL from PayPal because he’s using my email address and they all come to me!!!! Helloooooooo!!!! Ugh.

I have serious doubts about this as USAA has never made mistakes regarding autopayments since I have been a member. After disconnecting with PayPal’s service representative, I contact USAA. After reviewing my account, a second time with the banker we were unable to find any pending transactions or attempts from Paypal to take the $29.00 payment out of my account. Despite my other payment of $56.00 being taken out a few days prior. My USAA account is the only account I have been making payment from and I have not had issues with payments posting, until this time. I can provide bank statements showing I had enough funds in my account to cover the $29.00 on the date the original payment confirmation email was sent 11/27/2021. Which is a Saturday\n\nAfter speaking with USAA I was told the no payment from Paypal had been posted to my account pending or otherwise in the amount of $29.00 and the payment, if triggered Would not have gone through. Due to the Federal Reserve being closed, the earliest date the payment would have posted would be today 11/29/2021.\n\nI called PayPal back and they was told I would be charged a late fee, despite the error clearly being on their end. I’m done with you PayPal, I have the funds to pay balance in full and will be closing my account. Since USAA noted this I will pay the late fee and dispute the charge.

She tells me she can’t disclose why my account has been permanently limited after I already told her the reason PayPal is saying, as it literally says on my PayPal “SPECIFICALLY the sale of sexually oriented materials or services” to which she can’t even form a proper explanation to and tells me there’s nothing I can do that my account is in foreclosure with no reasoning as to where they got their evidence from. This phone call lasts over 10 mins and takes about €10 or more of my phone credit since PayPal are too stingy to ring anybody, they have to be rang! What a waste of my time and €10, DO NOT USE PAYPAL!! This company is the definition of a pi$$ take, I wish there was an alternative to use. They shut down peoples accounts over false accusations and then don’t give people the option to appeal them, truly a JOKE!!', 'user': '5ebc099eee8f296347d035f5', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

Fast forward, I go online to put in a dispute with my bank and the transaction wasn’t able to be disputed thru the pnc website I had to physically go to the bank and sign a statement saying that I was scammed so that I could get my money back which I’ve never had to do before so clearly Microsoft knew they were scamming and must be getting lots of chargebacks.

Extremely unhappy with their customer service. Sent money to a friend internationally from the United States.

Called them 4 times and each time they spouted nonsense by saying "We will send your friend the full amount, just wait 48 hours".\n\nToday was the final straw. Called them for the 5th time and had over an hour phone call with the representative to resolve this issue. 40 minutes out of the hour, she put me on hold and said she was investigating. After she was done "investigating" she said sorry, there is nothing I can do since the money has already been sent. She said that I sent the money to my friend under the category of "goods and services", instead of "friends or family".\n\nI said that when I was sending money through the website, I was not given an option of choosing "friends or family" or "goods and services". I even sent a screenshot through email of what I see when I send money, showing that I did not have that option.\nShe asked if I had just opened an account for the first time and I said yes. The day I sent money to my friend, was the day I opened a paypal account. She said "ahh that is why, when you make your first transaction with paypal, it will be categorized under goods and services and the second time I make a transaction, I will have the option to choose".\n\nI told her that there was no where in writing from paypal that stated that, the first transaction I make, it will be categorized under "goods and services" and have a transaction fee taken out. Heck, there was no transparency even, that there would be a transaction fee when I did a final review before sending the money.\n\nI told her that I don\'t want to hear just a "sorry" from a billion dollar company when it was not my fault to begin with. She offered a $50 voucher, which quite frankly was a slap in my face.\n\nI responded "Does that sound fair to you? Giving me a $50 voucher, after you take $62.28 as a transaction fee?, in which I was not informed about and secondly, had no where in writing that stated the first transaction would be categorized under goods and services."\n\nShe had the audacity to tell me that she thought it was a fair deal and that the next time I send money to use the app instead. She must be delusional, because there won\'t be a next time, especially not with the way they handled this issue.

They locked it because my wife has sent me money a few times & I pull it out or use my PayPal card to buy things. ummm ain't that what PayPal is for ? I'm very confused. Anyway they want so much from me that I feel is none of there business & my private things. So I called & the lady was Hella rude until I got her to understand my wife sent me money on multiple occasions because I'm old school, I like my money in cash in my wallet or my safe, so I don't use plastic much & for a long time was happy using PayPal for the few things I needed a card for, then her attitude changed & she told me don't worry about 18 of the things they wanted & just upload my ID & Proof that the card linked to paypal is mine. & that's all I needed for them to unlock my account. so I did upload those things & even like 4 other things they wanted but not all 20 because some of it is private & not their business. But here it is about 4 days after I called & account is still locked & they sent me another mail saying they want to know what every money in account was from, what every purchase I made was for, if things were shipped, if things were shipped to me, shipped from me, really why is that even they're concern. I'm sure there are tons of people who use PayPal to send money to their wife for their wife send money to them what is the problem? So I talked to them online after talking to her they said they needed all those things I said I was not comfortable giving them some of them & I don't feel like I should have to tell them what every purchase was what every dollar went to So they threatened to on December 3rd put more limitations on my account OK what else are you gonna do? make it where I can't put money in the PayPal account because right now I can't use none of my money in there but can put more in, who in there right mind would add money somewhere that you can't use it? is that even legal? can they keep my money.

It'll be great for the article I'm writing for a major publication but as a human being it really leaves me angry, confused and wondering how PP trains its supervisors.\n\nMy issue is common according to my banking institution.

From being cut off when being transferred, to a department I'm sure is intent on being the utmost in unpleasant, blame shifting ad observed or indifferent to factual complaints I'm astonished PP doesn't see themselves in the media more often.\n\nYes the customer service rep was pleasant and helpful, the next department the same, above that... good luck being heard. Good luck having reports from the bank supporting your claim and notifying them of an obvious gap. Enjoy being talked at, condescended too, made to feel guilty or at fault for errors which may or may not have been yours. In this case the vendor routed to PP not the credit card request.\n\nLike a hamster on a wheel both individuals in this department were adamant about the process being fine and the bank and individual at fault. Heres where the PTSD and anxiety come in. Yes, making your customers feel ignorant is not a good policy and or procedure. Not wanting to fix or address and admitted gap in the system also a failure. Having barn animals stepping on the conversation almost through its entirety... well, PP I'm sure will come up with a reason why that's part of the policy. How farm animals are support animals for their employees who have no idea what supporting a client is.\n\nUltimately, PP's client support and shady business practices is beyond reprehensible. Lucky for PP, it's hired the right amount of stress inducing, fault not fact staff and managers they could find.\n\nSo... the next time PP tries to withdraw money already paid (and confirmed by Customer Service as overcharged) and uses the line that you and your bank are wrong or it takes 10 days to clear so we keep trying.

I gave them the freaking shipping info confirming it was delivered even back prior to the transaction happening; not good enough! Escalated to 2 supervisors which the final one comes out and says their system needs 24 hours to recognize the shipping info uploaded and is delivered etc etc. Said they can\'t manually override until 24 hours after its uploaded and even then it will likely bug out because the delivery date is before the transaction date and apparently this is such an anomaly they have never seen before, they had no way of efficiently planning for this because apparently shipping only happens after any and ALL paypal transactions lol horrible service.', 'user': '6185bdf7e18e5000122bae95', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

Anyways I sent him a message asking why two eChecks have been sent to me from him, he responded saying it was a mistake, and that he sent them to me as I\'m on his payee contact and he mixed me up with some else, I said no worries I will cancel them! I was having issues it wasn\'t leting me cancel or reject them I contacted PayPal "Support" three times explaining the situation and they all told me 3 different things, anyways explained what they said to me, to him and told him, it looks like I\'m gonna have to refund it when they credit, he seemed fine and said no worries, After that i messaged him and said I would bank transfer the money and I will just keep that when it clears he was fine with that so I transferred the money to his bank (my fault) and that was that I messaged him when they finally cleared and said was all ok after 8 working days, and he said that\'s great etc then I noticed 2 days later he blocked me on PayPal and my number! Didn\'t think nothing of it or even care but 3 weeks later (yesterday) my PayPal balance is -£89.12 I contacted them and they said that it was claimed back by his bank.... I explained that I sent him the payments, I sent the conversations, the texts and evidence of it all and explained that he\'s Clearly pulled a fast one, and he\'s got his money back not only of me but his bank, so I\'m -£50 and in top of that it says -£89? They said because I raised a dispute? I was charged £12 for it and they have added a fee, I literally asked why I was -£89 and didn\'t dispute anything was enquiring! oh and after a review it still stands? I\'m absolutely fuming despite me showing that I had sent him the money to his bank etc and that he blocked me on PayPal for no reason yet I\'m the one Now supposedly having to pay £90 on top of the £50 I\'ve lost as he clearly got his money back,Im absolutely shocked but I don\'t think so they ain\'t getting a penny of me, I\'ve contacted my bank and sent them all the messages from me to PayPal support and the messages to the guy, and they can see I sent him funds, Even adviser at my bank said after going through it all what I sent her she can see that "on 4 occasions you have tried to get the payments stopped and sent back to him to no avail" and she even said that the message responses from PayPal support don\'t even make sense, she said they "contradict each other" and they have ignored several issues I\'ve provided evidence for! She even said it\'s a sloppy mess and they haven\'t followed there procedures correctly just looking at what she can see! So She\'s advised me to taking this further with Fraud department she\'s forwarded it all to the fraud department and said I\'ve done everything necessary and even risking sending him money on my own that unfortunately backfired! But she told me they will get it sorted asap.\n\nTo top it off PayPal have randomly asked me to verify myself...despite been with them for 4-5 years and I\'ve already verified myself twice and was told I wouldn\'t need to again (2 years ago) tried closing My paypal account won\'t let me, tried taking cards off won\'t let cos I owe them money!! The audacity.\n\nSo there basically saying that I may not be me, yet holding onto my card details to Bill me? Cancelled both cards and unlinked my PayPal via bank luckily I managed to remove it on PayPal but they quickly stopped me deleting my cards!

A friends and family transaction that went horribly wrong left me without the money for about a month (so far, because I still don\'t have it). Every time I called I was given false information. I tried everything they told me to try. This is absolutely ridiculous. I have realized their customer service team doesn\'t actually know what they are talking about. Every new person I talk to tells me the last person was misinformed and gives me more incorrect information or a few things I have found out to be flat out lies. Even when a transaction email states it would be 1 more business day before I finally received the money that I have been waiting weeks for, I was told after calling this was an incorrect email and it would be 3-5 business days. Approaching that date and without even a pending transaction on my account I call and was informed it would be AT LEAST 5 business days. This is after multiple weeks of calls to find out why so many holds were placed on my transaction. Even following their guidance of a "21 day hold for MY safety" I found the money still wasn\'t available to even transfer into my account until calling and complaining after 24 days of waiting. I don\'t know how a company can continuously hold money from people even when it goes against their maximum hold policies. On top of that all of the fees I encountered for a transaction I was assured would be free when I originally called to ask about it is enough to make me permanently delete this app and site from my life altogether. I have never wasted so much time and energy to only continuously be lied to, charged fees, and have my money held even when following 100% of the protocol I was told to follow. The customer service on multiple occasions told me I did everything correctly and then made another excuse as to why my money was still being withheld, or giving me a hopeless trail of lies to follow. I also have another issue. Since then I have had two breaches in my bank account and had to go through hell to re-secure my checking account. Since the first one was 2 days after adding bank account information to PayPal and I have never had any issues like this before, I am highly suspicious of their security and as soon as the money is in my account I am going to remove all of my information from them and delete my PayPal.

I ended up explaining my story to 5 different people, in different departments, and really didn\'t resolve anything at all. All I know is that a transaction wasn\'t paid off in the normal way by direct debit. I don\'t know why because there\'s no issue on my side. So that put me in "negative balance". I didn\'t recognise the transaction, I said that repeatedly, I also said I was worried someone had hacked my account. Nobody seemed to understand the whole picture. They could only deal with their little bit (eg unlocking my account). Anyway, I\'ve finally managed to get into my account... but I honestly find the activity log so difficult to understand (I mean why show a single transaction in 5 different ways - I want to see the amount, and whether it\'s in or out, and then the balance).\n\nOn reading so many bad reviews here, plus not feeling 100% that transactions don\'t go through more than once, I think it\'s now time to close my account...', 'user': '583b13710000ff000a5b741d', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

Get this first we decided to add a business account to our established personal account. They do not tell you that the account is locked while they verify you. We have used this account for 9 years, they have taken thousands from us, but now they need to verify.\nSo anyways we went to purchase something through paypal for $5.00 and we get refused for the transaction. We know we have the money in the account it’s only $5.00. Anyways we talk to paypal last week about this and they said they need more information from us to verify an account; that has been open for 9 years already.\nWe decided to close the account they said they could not close the account because they were waiting for more information from us. We have given them enough info their issue was that the one document we sent them had two addresses. One was the land address that most people give the second was our box number which every town uses. We cannot control a company if they issue statements that show both our addresses.\nSo, we figured that is enough we will not keep jumping through hoops. A little common sense could have figured that out. I came into Trustpilot while I was waiting on hold with paypal to see how terrible paypal is in many other peoples’ eyes. Wow 86% one star that tells me that I am making the right decision to get away from paypal.\nSo they say they won’t close the account until they get the right info but if the businesses only give out statements with both addresses there is nothing we can do. We decided to never use the account and if it gets hacked we will contact our lawyer and SUE! 5 times we asked for it to be closed.\n\nWe decided to open a new account, we purchase three items without an issue then the forth item we needed to verify it is us? Are you kidding me once again, why? Because this should have been done first before you take any money out of an account not after the 3rd time. Then I go and check a little deeper into the account and I see fiverr has been added as automatic payment. Now you tell me how this would have ever happened when paypal denied the payment in the first place until I entered into a popup window my banking information, which I never did. I also had to disable my vpn giving me virtually no security at all except for https which if you know much about security is virtually zero.\nNow get this for the husband to talk on my behalf I had to verify and give permission for the husband to talk. Guess what the big security was on verifying the wife. What is your full name, you can find this info in almost any house from a bill that may be lying around. What I am saying is after all of this verifying (with banking info, location info …) then to only have what is your full name was NOT secure in the least.

After seeing the hundreds of complaints on the web about this very scam and no resolve from paypal i have concluded that AT BEST, paypal is perpetuating this scam & in my opinion is probably the OWNER of this scam!!! Look on line @ the present class action lawsuits and bad feedback on paypal.

Though I correctly confirmed my first and last names, I was told that they do not match their records. Worried that my account may have been hacked, I tried several minutes justifying my name with proof. The staff was unable to give me any hints of the failure. Eventually it became evident from past emails that the staff was expecting my title (i.e. “Mr”) to be included when confirming my full name. According to the PayPal staff, the omission of the title (i.e. Mr, Miss, Mrs..) when asked to confirm the full name will constitute a security authentication failure.\n\nThen I was asked for to quote the last 4 digits of my card registered with PayPal. Since I was unsure of the actual card, the support staff want me readout the numbers of all my cards to him. Since some of my past credit cards are no longer with me now and also I wasn’t keen to give details of all my cards to PayPal, I asked the staff whether he could proceed to alternative options/questions instead of the card details. Though, I have setup four security questions/answers initially when opening the PayPal account, the support staff stated that those security questions are only for online support and are useless for telephone support. The staff suggested that I cancel my PayPal account since I can’t remember one particular information.\n\nI then contacted the support team via Facebook Messenger, asking them to comment on my experience with their telephone support team. Though they have appreciated the difficulties, they haven’t confirmed or denied whether their support team have correctly followed the security authentication process.', 'user': '5861187f0000ff000a658a6d', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

I had been using PayPal\'s services for about 8 years without a single issue besides maybe losing my debit card and having a little trouble getting a replacement ordered.\n\nThen all of a sudden one day it happened.... I got an email from them that said that they we\'re going to put permit restrictions on my account and start the process to close it and I would not be able to have an account with PayPal ever again. The reason was very big and it basically said... I had violated the terms of the user agreement.\n\nWhat whoa so I immediately went online and went to the website and tried to find the user agreement I did eventually find it. The agreement is about 25-30 pages long btw... I wonder how many people to open the account actually read the whole thing I\'m going to say 3% of the people do.\n\nI called the customer service department and was told that the internal security system software had found a violation in one of my transactions and it\'s all that the rep could tell me because they didn\'t have access to that information.\n\nSo I asked who does can I talk to them of course I couldn\'t talk to them because they didn\'t know who had access. Then they said "I don\'t think there is anybody that does..it\'s just a computer program" BS!\nI went back and reread the user agreement again that\'s what I figured out what happened. I had recently sold to Rockaway recycling converter that came off of a vehicle that I parted out and then sent to the scrap yard. Have this sale was 100% legal and legit and I have all the paperwork required to prove it. Rockwell recycling is a big national company and they actually advertise on the website when you sell them a kind of converter that you should use PayPal to get paid because it\'s faster and easier. Huh that\'s a conflict if I ever seen one.\n\nJust to clarify on the user agreement there is a section of about three to four sentences in there that basically says that buying or selling anything that is deemed as a high potential for fraud by a government agency you can\'t do with a PayPal account. Wait a second... they advertise using PayPal on their dang website. I was just doing what the company said was the best way to get paid.\n\nYou\'re the best part about it is in addition to closing my account PayPal put a freeze and hold on any funds I had for 180 days that\'s 6 months I couldn\'t touch my money! Which seems like an awful lot of time if they\'re supposedly worried about things coming back transactions are checks or something and they wanted the money in there in case they had to pay them 6 months it\'s not 1849 anymore 2021 doesn\'t take 6 months to do anything.\n\nAnyway after going back and forth multiple times talking to Rockaway recycling and PayPal, I still never had any luck getting somebody to explain to me what actually is going on.\n\nNeedless to say...at this point, I\'m done with PayPal, I really don\'t care if I have an account there.\nMost importantly, people need to know what\'s going on.\n\nIn my case.... after almost nine years without a problem...this happened. I started looking into their track record and customer complaints....PayPal\'s record is abysmal to put it lightly. I just wish they would have given me a chance to even explain. The bright lining is there\'s lots of other companies get off for the same services and their customer complaint track record are much better than PayPal\'s...so if you\'re thinking about getting a PayPal account...stop and think...about not doing it.', 'user': '61459814f7e65e00128eaa04', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

{'platform': 'Paypal ', 'stars': 2, 'review_date': '2021-09-15', 'review_time': '21:52:53', 'review_title': 'Den of Theives', 'review_body': 'I have been using PayPal since 2008. The only good thing about PayPal is IF and only IF you are able to make a seamless transaction. In the event that you have to dispute a transaction or have a simple problem that needs to be resolved, PayPal fails miserably. Ever since they outsourced all operations overseas the service has become simply the worst payment option currently available. I recently had to make a dispute for a $200 product that I purchased but the company sent me the wrong product. I contacted the company and could get NO, ZERO response from my phone calls or emails or chat feature on the vendor\'s website. So, I was forced to call PayPal and file a dispute. All I can say is - using PayPal is just not worth your time. I filed my dispute, after waiting on hold for 30 minutes. Then I got someone on the phone and all she would say was "we appreciate your patience. We love you and your business. We are very sorry this happened to you" After repeating my issue at least 3 times she not only got it wrong each time, "wrong item arrived." She then said "I have to switch you to another dept." Another ten or more minutes on hold a representative picks up that had NO IDEA who I was or my name, issue etc. Not only do they ask my name, they want to know my address etc. I am fine giving it but they already asked upon initial contact. In 2021, shouldn\'t all my account information be on the computer when they transfer my call. I start all over again, explaining my reason for this simple, straightforward dispute. An hour later, no joke, they put you on hold then come back and ask the same questions over and over. Again, call centers overseas simply do not know our customs, laws, or anything about a simple process. She was telling me "well, you got your product." No, I told her - they sent me the wrong product that I paid for and I have tried several times to contact the seller. Finally, they then tell me they will handle my dispute. I finally get to hang up but then I get an email, days later asking me to respond to their questions. They tell you to go to the resolution center and when I did not only was there NO WAY to respond, the text in my dispute complaint was not at all accurate - after repeating to the representative at least 4 times initially. So, you have to call again and the same exact process as I detailed above happens. Wait on hold. Wait for someone to answer. Get transferred. Name. Address - all over again. Then, they have no idea about my dispute so you basically have to request a dispute again. They barrage you with the same thing "I appreciate your patience. We are extremely sorry that this happened to you etc." It is as if they are trying to wear you down so you just give up and just forget about any credit and go away; which is very easy to do as they are really inept and do not care. If you search PayPal you see 20K-and counting reviews that average 1 Star. But, if you look at their stock price, the stock is thriving. Why? Because of this very process I, and countless others have had to endure and endure today. PayPal is literally stealing from their customers. They told me that they would credit my account - never happened. So, you either call again or you just give up because the time it takes to call them again is simply not economical. In addition, when I told her that the wrong product was mailed, I told her that it was a mistake on the company\'s part. She was speaking to me in a tone and manner as if I was a thief or bad person and was making a dishonest claim. Her attitude was she was doing me a favor. Now, when I say "she" it is all of them. Since COVID I have noticed many companies are making mistakes, sending wrong products, products never arrive, and you cannot reach these customers other than to make a purchase. So, when you call PayPal, which I have had to do at least three times in the past 19 months, same runaround. I rarely use my PayPal now only if the transaction is under $10 so in the event I have an issue, I am only out a small amount of money.', 'user': '61426b1caf3bae0012491c47', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

Previous, had a bad time and difficulty dealing with how PayPal was delaying and hindering my access to my money. Since that horrific experience, things have improved. Transfers went more smooth, had no difficulty with transactions, although limited by a set weekly transfer amount. Of 3k. So since I could not transfer my money out fast enough, I simply used that account for all expenses.\nI like crypto. Especially Bitcoin, and Ethereum. They had a little crypto exchange. It was convenient, easy to use. Exposes this new technology to people that otherwise don't know anything about it. Which is good. More people need to use what crypto has to offer. Investing is a start. Paypal made it pretty simple! So, my previous outrage and frustration with PayPal has subsided.. And everything has been handled smoothly since.. Hint:: Make sure all info is totally current and verified. PayPal security gets nervous handling larger amounts of money. For example, $10k. Trying to transfer anything over $3k a week typically won't happen.

They locked my account after receiving a few payments (perfectly legal business transaction, logged and traceable in our business´ bookkeeping). In order to release my account they requested a copy of drivers license, registration documents for my business and a copy of an invoice, which we uploaded instantly, receiving an automatic reply that it will be processed in 2-4 days. After a week I contacted customer support (CS), receiving non-answers and being asked to upload the documents over and over and over again. Their CS is completely useless – the only way to get in contact is to chat with someone who is just giving useless answers from a guide book, without any connection to your case at all. The phone number to the Swedish office is not monitored (I called 200-300 times without any answer). After weekly communication, through the CS chat, for a couple of months (!) we were asked to provide information about our business online, on their platform, which we did instantly. Unfortunately this platform is not functional and automatically deletes part of the information that was entered, which turned out to be a huge problem regarding legal names etc. CS did not get what the problem was and only provided basic and useless information out of the guide book. After communicating with CS 2-3 times per week for 6 months (!!!) we finally got a useful hint from the technical department to “request a senior agent” to manage our case. After we had done that, through the CS chat, the case was finally resolved. We were close to giving up though, since the whole situation was so frustrating and that there seemed to be no way to solve it. It took us about 80 working hours to communicate and upload documents. The chat transcript covers about 60 pages (!).\nAfter research online I believe that paypal have legal rights to close down any account, without any legal demand for a motivation, and then gain control of the funds, since they do not obey to international bank laws. To me paypal equals an unjust, dysfunctional and stinking business which targets small businesses and “the small man” in order to fatigue them with a useless CS and dysfunctional platform to finally gain control of their funds. None of these have resources enough, regarding either money or time, to take on a huge international business juridically, but someone definitely should! Thinking about using paypal?

Paypal asked a dozen times for SMS, email and other verifications. I verified myself and transfers several times with bank IDs.\n\nAfter making the SEPA transfer from the bank account to PayPal, the money left the account but did not appear in PayPal.\n\nAfter several hours, I got in touch with a chat service where the issue didn’t work out. I was then called from PayPal (English only, no service available in my own language) and again asked for multiple verifications (account number, SMS verification and personal information), despite PayPal calling me.\n\nPaypal said there is a security risk when a customer with their bank IDs transfers money from their own bank account to the PayPal service and they need to verify the correctness of the transfer (despite the bank identification).\n\nPayPal claims the problem was with the Chrome browser I was using (?).\n\nFinally, today the money appeared in my PayPal account. PayPal is displayed as the payer of the money, so PayPal has taken over the money for the duration of the check.\nI do not understand the nature of the check because I paid the money with my bank ID from my bank account to my PayPal account.\n\nToday I tried to pay for a purchase in an online store (Proshop.com). Payment for the purchase was suspended 21 times. I received an SMS verification request 11 times, 2 times I was asked to change my password and despite that the payment was not successful. Each time there was a message "We are unable to complete your purchase right now, return to the merchant page and try again"\n\nAfter 48 minutes and more than 20 attempts, I tried to contact the chat service. The chat service did not work at all. I called PayPal. Again, service in English only. PayPal explained that again there is a security risk and payment cannot be made. Said I could try to pay again after 72 hours.\n\nAccording to PayPal, they can’t say where the fault is, they just explained that it’s a security risk.\n\nNo need to explain that no transaction waits 72 hours for a pending payment transaction (ProShop waits 10 minutes)\n\nThe product was not purchased.\n\nNow I tried to transfer money from PayPal back to my bank account without success. PayPal\'s statement: "There was a problem. We weren\'t able to transfer the money to the bank right now."\n\nI am now unable to transfer my own money from my PayPal account to my own bank account. The account is the same from which I transferred the money to PayPal.\n\nPayPal now has over € 1,000 of money stuck, and there is no information on when they can be transferred back to my own bank account.\n\nPayPal is a completely invalid system. Transferring money from your own bank account with bank IDs is a "security risk", paying for purchases in a large online store is not possible because it is a security risk, and your own money cannot be transferred back to your own bank account.\n\n\nI strongly advise you to avoid using PayPal.', 'user': '6130d1a6664dbf00126a28bb', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

We run a business and used PayPal as one of our payment gateways. Recently, we have observed several transactions that we deemed as fraudulent, and whilst they kept on coming, the clients started asking for refunds, and we have sent a signed letter to PayPal to advise them their platform was being used for such illicit activity, and asked for guidance as for what to do. We have immediately taken steps to stop further transactions to be completed, and guess what PayPal did? Yes, nothing. Long-story-short, a few weeks later, we had delivered some of the products of a few of these transactions, but because they were fraudulent, all were cancelled by their banks, or had their refund directly issued by us, and we ended up with a substantial amount of loss coming from those. Frustrated with the incompetence, lack of support, and how slack PayPal was in face of the situation, I asked for my account to be closed, and guess what? They are charging us dispute fees for each of the criminal transactions, plus the fee for the transaction itself, which wasn't refunded after they were either cancelled or refunded to the clients, and because the account has now a negative balance, they are refusing to close it until we pay them - yes you have read it right! They have directly supported a criminal activity, even after we have made them aware of it, have not provided any guidance or support to our company as for what to do in that situation, and now are charging us for that. And the support, once again, terrible. I've spoken to Maria Carmellita, Gabriel and Michelle, and none of them seemed to give a dang about it all, always trying to roll the situation over to the next support person to resolve. They are now threatening to send the negative balance to a collection house, and we will wait for the to come along to we can take legal action against PayPal and their criminal organisation they call a company. We were baffled by it all, and because we had balance in the account prior the situation, the only leftover fee to pay is of about USD60, which is ridiculous, and not even a fraction of the losses we incurred, but we are not paying it as a matter of principle, and we will stand by it against this awful company. PayPal, you should be ashamed of yourself, your support service, your employees, and your lack or care for your clients.

They seem to arbitrarily hold money sometimes for some people without forewarning you so the poor recipient who\'s waiting in good faith for their payment now receives nothing and is told their funds are "on hold". Leaving us to explain and apologise profusely thus putting people in an awful predicament.\n\nI negotiated a purchase on a rare designer bag. It took a day of negotiations and finally, when all was agreed, I asked to make payment via PayPal. They didn\'t use it often but did have an account so they agreed. I sent the payment through, it left my account and I thought all was well. Then I started getting angry messages from the seller about wasting their time.... I had no idea what was wrong and they sent me a screenshot saying their payment was "on hold" and would not be released until the bag was delivered. I was mortified and spent another hour apologising and explaining...it was awful. Its not the holding funds that is the problem, its the fact that they don\'t tell you before you finalise and send payment. If I had known, I could have prepared the seller or maybe made alternative arrangements. The seller lost trust in me and PayPal completely ruined the delicate transaction. I had used PayPal very regularly and had never had them hold funds before so I didn\'t even consider that this might happen.\n\nI had another two terrible experiences this week. The first was with a dispute which PayPal kept messing up and prolonging.\nThey gave me an address to return my faulty item to. I sent it using a tracked service and it was attempted delivery a day later.\n\nThen I got an update on my claim saying that I should send the item to a different address!! I was furious. I called them and they were all so friendly and polite but talk in some weird circular way so that you never actually get a straight answer and they make promises to sort it out for you but don\'t actually (because decisions are made by the mysterious Back Office who no-one is able to speak directly to). I explained that I sent it to the address that they supplied me with and they couldn\'t locate the email and claimed it was maybe a spoof or spam email. It wasn\'t of course, it was just one department not knowing what the other department is doing and not passing on information. It\'s absolutely mind-bendingly stressful trying to get anything sorted with them. I actually spent 7 hours over a week on the phone with them just because of their errors on this dispute. I had to threaten to make a formal complaint and all kinds of things just for them to finally hear me and to finally properly review all the info I had sent them and see I had done my part exactly according to their instructions.\n\nThen today, a friend sent me some money but, because he is not a regular Paypal user, he accidentally clicked on the wrong button and instead of sending it as a personal payment/transfer which is free, he clicked on payment for a service. This incurs fees and I was charged £51 for this. It was a total accident, human error and has never happened before. I rang them to explain and ask if, on this one and only occasion, they would refund the payment so we could re-do as a personal transfer as it was a completely honest mistake and they would not budge an inch. So I have lost £50 to the PayPal because my friend pressed the wrong button! My friend feels absolutely terrible about it and I do too as well as being £50 out of pocket. Another day messed-up by PayPal. And it\'s easy mistake to make because the sending by "friends and family" was always obvious and visible and clear....now, it\'s still there but they don\'t make it as clear at all.\n\nAnd the other thing is receiving limits. They put receiving limits on people\'s accounts but don\'t tell them how much or even that there is a limit. So again, after negotiating a purchase from a lady in Spain, I sent through payment and it was blocked because of some sort of receiving limit. They wouldn\'t tell her or me what it was and it was such a stressful process for her to try and increase the limit that she had to cancel the transaction with me.\n\nIf they would be transparent with people so we know we have limits on spending or receiving and we know that they payment we are going to send will be put on hold, we can anticipate this and work with it.\n\nWhen we are completely in the dark and these issues pop up suddenly without warning, it completely ruins the trust between buyer and seller. I have to agree with a former comment that their practices are scandalous and shocking.\n\nI will never use PayPal again after this and do not recommend them to anyone.', 'user': '5d98837e91a5aecfc1625c1d', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

I was on hold with a gentlemen for at least an hour and he was trying his best to fix it for me and he was having issue putting in my new form of payment and so I thought everything was settled and I even confirmed it with him and said so my pay in 4 will go through and he blatantly said yes! I don’t usually check my email, but when I decided to check just for fun, it says all of my payments never went through, and so I called them again, and they say nothing they can do about it, and that the guy I talked to was not traceable like I was lying.

If they harass you long enough you will finally give up, take a financial lost and close the case. They must have been taken over by the USPS. I purchased a guitar and when I received it the neck was damaged. I called the seller and he send me a prepaid return shipping label. Upon receipt of the guitar he agreed to refund all but $100.00 in his attempt to recoup his shipping costs. I filed a complaint with PayPal and the nightmare began. They have no idea what they are doing. I would send written info they asked for and then I would receive the same request for the same info as if they never got it. All automated forms. I would call PayPal and get someone who had no clue. After countless calls I finally get an email informing the seller has agreed to refund the $99.33. But the email states I need to return the guitar which was done 3 weeks earlier. After an hour on the phone I get through to a HUMAN. After going over all this which was like trying to explain 3rd year algebra to a 6 year old they tell me I need to provide the tracking number for the return of the guitar. Fortunately, I had made a copy of the shipping label. While I am waiting on the human I entered the Fed Ex tracking number and print out a proof of delivery form. I tell the person on the phone I have a proof of delivery form and they ask me to email it to them. I immediately receive and email response that has nothing to do with what we are doing. When I asked what is next I am told they will contact me if they need any more info from me. What in the world could they want now. Pictures of my last colonoscopy. The seller has agreed to pay the $99.33. Trying to communicate with PayPal is like asking someone what is their favorite color and their response is “fried chicken”. There is a new Bully in the financial world and it is called PayPal. I used PayPal 3 years ago to purchase a Honda Generator online. It ended up being a scam. I contacted PayPal and they said it would take weeks to get my $1000.00 returned. I immediately called Visa and told them and the $1000 was credited back to my account within 24 hours. Why would anyone use PayPal if the credit card company made it so easy? Only because PayPal is the only way to pay online with some merchants. This has got to change. When I asked Visa what they would do about the money their response was that they have a special department that handles that. If Visa can do it so can PayPal. And BTW at Visa I talked to an American who didn’t start the conversation with “NOT TO WORRY”! That is as bad as the server whose response to a question is “NO PROBLEM”. Why not “My Pleasure”.

I am not a person who typically likes to spend time writing reviews or protest, but when I do, it is for a big reason.\nIf I could, I would donate just to make this company dissapear forever.', 'user': '611a2665abba900012fc67c7', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

Recently, my online accounts were compromised (no idea how, as I'm always very careful with my online presence), and my Paypal via Google Pay was used to set up a recurring app subscription to something called +10 Life (Red Rain) to the tune of £43.49 per week. Luckily, I caught the transaction, not quickly enough to prevent the initial charge to go through, but quickly enough to cancel the subscription and remove my payment methods from my PayPal account. It was then that I discovered that Google had, thankfully, declined 2 earlier attempted transactions for £259 for +10 Life (Dont Tap), and £129 for +10 Life (Jumping Animals). I later found that these transactions were made in Russia, and the apps were sold by a Russian vendor (I'm in the UK). I opened a dispute with PayPal, originally for Fraud/Unauthorised Transaction, but changed to Goods/Service Not Received. I provided them with a chat transcript from Google Pay support, and a screen print of the attempted transactions, along with the single successful one, as proof of the declined attempts, and the location of the successful one. I was informed that the transaction would be investigated, and that Google would have until 19 August to respond with further information to support my claim, and that if they received no response, they would automatically find in my favour, and issue a refund. This was on 7 August. I received an email today stating:\n\nWe received the claim(s) you opened on 7 August 2021.\n\nWe've reviewed the transaction(s) and are denying your claim(s). This decision was made because we never received documentation that proves you are due a credit.\n\nWe're sorry for any problems you may have experienced with the transaction(s).\n\nI've checked with Google Pay support, who kindly informed me that they've yet to receive any information request from PayPal. PayPal have provided no information on how they arrived at their decision, and have stonewalled my attempts to appeal their findings, or provide additional supporting information. Couple this with the frustrating lack of clarity using the PayPal resolution centre, or the attempts to fob you off with automated responses instead of speaking to a person, and I've found, along with the vast majority of others leaving their review here, that PayPal cares little for their customers when fraud is apparent.

Paypal after stating that yes I am under purchase protection, yes thhey would get me a refund, and yes that they understood the account used was hacked they still decided to rule against me.\n\nSo now not only did I not get a refund for the multiple transactions done on my account. G2G only cared about quickly delivering the items to the hacker just so they can have the excuse of the items being delivered already to provide as evidence to paypal. On top of not only contacting both paypal and G2G immediately on the day it occurred to dispute/cancel the payments neither party helped me in stopping it and allowed me to lose the money spent on goods not even directed to me. On top of this same even someone else had sent money into my paypal account to spend on G2G and then refunded it via "Unauthorized Transaction" more than likely from another hacked account.\n\nOne rep told me just use invoices if I am selling stuff, another told me contact the person to refund you or send you the money again (this never works by the way cause they will ignore paying you) cause they already won the case. Third rep in fact tried to limit my account and not the other party which makes no sense at all. Fourth actually told me they got the refund through their bank when it stated it\'s Paypal Balance and another rep right after didn\'t tell me the same thing at all they stated that it\'s cause they have a different IP which honestly cause of how tech is today they can just VPN or have someone else use their login to pay for things (not even paypal would be able to actually know if these people did so or not).\n\nAs of current G2G still uses paypal to do their business the hacker still has possession of my account on G2G they received the goods from them and I am almost -$500 less on paypal because they only give sugar coated platitudes of "sorry I cannot help you" after siding against you. After getting a hold of probably my sixth or seventh rep I asked them so not only did your site not have any place to provide evidence you also never gave me an option to counter anything the other party gave you. Even after they gotten all the screenshots, transaction numbers, any other additional information and repeating myself again that my G2G account is not in my possession cause of the hacker (they managed to change all my login info and there was no link to stop them). Instead they continued to tell me things akin to yeah we are on your side when they really are not.\n\nBefore anyone comment and say why didn\'t you escalate I will tell you I have tried multiple times from twitter, facebook, on my own account, I emailed them, I tried to reopen my case, all of these and where did it get me the answer is nowhere. I even called more than one branch of paypal and I did it for almost an entire week straight. It wasn\'t until the second to last call I called they told me "sorry once they other party provided proof of delivery you would lose the case even if you escalate it." Guess what I decided to do I told them escalate it anyways, guess what didn\'t happen they didn\'t escalate it. So I called in again got another rep they instead said "You cannot win the case even when escalated and I do not want you to keep having to call back for something you can\'t fix so would you please stop calling." If that isn\'t enough to tell me that everything I did was in vain I don\'t know what would. Now I have around 7 disputes all closed in the favor of the other party when I am the one being scammed and all I can do is grieve over my losses and trying to find a way to cover the cost of everything.', 'user': '610d389dd50a1f0013ac1bee', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

Do Not Use This Service. I am a business owner who decided to get PayPal for quick and easy card charges. For one, 3.5% fee for card usage is a bit high but doable. What’s not doable is every single transaction, even with “Instant transaction” is not instant. I can understand 12 hours of first time withdrawal to confirm bank is correct, but after the first transaction it’s 72 hours+ for a withdrawal?? Why even offer the instant withdrawal feature like Venmo or Zelle? Do NOT use PayPal for any business affairs. They are a sham and customer service literally told me pretty much every withdrawal is subject to it? And when asked why even offer instant they said, “Well every transaction for withdrawal is subject to a wait period of 30 minutes to 72 hours” Why offer a quick service? No matter what they couldn’t answer that question without a script to read off of. Plus don’t even get me started on trying to get ahold of a person. Will be deleting my account and telling everyone I can possibly reach to not use them. They didn’t care that I am not using them anymore.

I received an email 3 days ago stating I can no longer do business on PayPal my account was suspended permanently and they were holding my funds. PayPal would not give me an exact reason as to why I was suspended just stated restricted items. Then I filed a claim with the BBB. PayPal responded with complete lies on the BBB report. They stated I received $2600 in friends/family payments then when I called PayPal to show me where I received that money they could not tell me because I didn’t receive it. They also stated I had one or more accounts associated with my account which is also a lie too I only have 1 account. So PayPal literally shut me down for no reason and then made up reasons for my suspension which they could not back up! Apparently PayPal thinks no one has authority over them and they can just lie to the Better Business Bureau. I will be suing PayPal and they will pay for what they have done to me. I caught them lying to the BBB and I have literal proof.\n\nPayPal needs to be shut down they are a bunch of lying dirty crooks. They will suspend you at will for literally no reason and freeze your funds for 180 days and maybe even take it. Do not use PayPal do not pay using their gateway if you can avoid it for every payment you make using their system they get paid. We need to wake up the masses to what PayPal does to honest hard working people and hit them where it hurts. If everyone stops using PayPal there will be no PayPal. Who’s with me? Do it now before you too are suspended!!!!!!!!!!!! Dirtiest company in the world! Why would you shut down a legitimate business after doing business for 9 years with no issues. More and more people are currently getting suspended PayPal is up to something and it should be highly illegal!\n\nAlso because I’m smart instead of PayPal stealing my money at the end like everyone else I never kept my money in PayPal. I ended up with $12k of their money which I will hold for a year and pay it back as slowly as possible.

A jeweler confirmed the mark is not 14K and I have many pictures. The stones are also not what was in the ad. I sent paypal the ad, the clear pictures of the 10K (not 14K) and the message screen shots of the seller offering me $50.00 (which was not enough but an admission of guilt). Paypal denied my claim and stated that I had "altered the item" and yet they gave me no evidence of this conclusion. They quite simply don\'t care that I was frauded. I would have been better served by going straight through my credit card company. It\'s too late now. I\'m shocked that I spend so much with paypal and I believed they would protect me. They don\'t care. They don\'t seem to do what\'s right but what\'s easy. I am no longer a faithful customer and will find another way to pay. I feel I was frauded twice.

After all, it states clearly on the front page pf PayPal's website that if a purchase does not match the Seller's description (and never was this more true than in this case) then they can reimburse you. PayPal however decided in their ultimate wisdom - despite the facts - that what we had received WAS in fact what we had ordered and therefore they denied the claim.

They were once a premier online payment processing service, now they are getting dumped at every corner by reputable businesses because they are thieves and criminals. They locked my daughters account and after 5 months of them basically ignoring us and sending form letters that weren\'t even related to our account (they had screwed something up and said the issue was over a year old when it was 30+ days) Finally after 5 months I decided it was time to retain council and file suit. I sent a last ditch email to the all but ignored "executiveoffices at paypal.com" email address where if they reply, it will be 30 days at best. I said I was moving forward with retaining council and filing suit in my local jurisdiction. I said I would allow for a reasonable amount of time for response prior to moving forward as a courtesy, mostly to show the court I had been more than accommodating. In the single most unexpected event of the 5 month debacle, they didn\'t respond but I got notice 24 hours later that the account was no longer restricted. I immediately withdrew the $2000 they had effectively stolen and refused to return and closed the account.\nShe had used the account for 8 months without a single issue. No chargebacks, no cases, no nothing. Suddenly one day the account is locked, says they need more information. This isn\'t unusual as you have to identify yourself so she did the three requested tasks and sent a copy of her driver\'s license within 24 hours of the request. The next 6 weeks were utterly unbelievable. The small business she was trying to start on ebay was shutout from taking payments. (ebay has since dumped them and fewer than 5% of customers now appear to be using paypal anymore based on our business records) We called 1 time a week for 6 weeks and were told every time, they couldn\'t do anything. The CSR\'s claimed to have no idea what was going on, but could see the account was locked. They said it was an internal review of the account and that once the info was submitted it should be unlocked within a couple days. Well by the 6th week they stopped saying that. I moved to finding the afore mention mostly ignored email address and went to the BBB site where I found them rated B. Never seen a company at B level, most horrible service corporations simply aren\'t accredited with the BBB. They had over 16,000 complaints in the last year a 1 star rating. No surprise there. I filed a complaint. BBB gives 30 days to respond, they respond the evening of the 29th day.....again not surprised. Their reply states they want shipping information for the items that were sold, personal identifying information for the account holder and a description of what is being sold as well as if it is a registered business. Well, all the transactions are sold online and shipped through paypal, paid for with paypal and tracked on paypal. That\'s BS reason 1. They want personal identification....BS reason 2 as the drivers license has already been uploaded, how much more personal can you get? A description of what is being sold is recorded at each sale and listed right there on the transaction...BS reason 3. Number 4 was the only legitimate question, though they had no business asking it. We responded accordingly. 25 days later they respond, asking for the same information again. Back and forth 4 times, BBB closes the case as unresolved. We then began trying to correspond with the executive offices via email. What a waste of time. Their response was always a form letter, and not one time did they have the correct account information. They were telling me about someone else\'s account for whom they had banned and refused to release their funds. Great, that\'s wonderful news and I guess that\'s the direction we\'re going? Last thing they sent said they were holding for 6 months, at which time they would consider releasing MY money. Time got away from me as I simply funded my daughter to move on, given the conditions of the country during Covid and paypals lack of caring whatsoever. My business was still running full tilt and we were in busy season so I had no time for these rejects. I had intended to file suit earlier, but time wasn\'t allowing me to get to the courthouse.\nAVOID these thieves at all costs.', 'user': '5d006b3bf371c6363b8f1859', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

Could have got a better rate from a loan shark! Not surprised eBay has severed ties.\nUPDATE\nI am attempting to resolve this with PayPal & the reason for the charge of 3% is that it is a “transaction with”, not “a refund”. Yet both the payments to me by the seller clearly state “ refund for ……..invoice….”. This is clearly stated on both refunds. Yet the operative tells me that I am a seller & received a payment. When I questioned this, they told me that not only had they already explained, but also that I should check the transaction history. I have done both, have asked for details of where I am shown as the seller, what services/goods I have supplied - now I have silence! Saga continues\nFURTHER UPDATE\nAfter 3 days, endless message exchanges, being told that I would receive a call that day & keep phone free (call received 3 DAYS LATER), resolution achieved - exgratia refund of fees EXCEPT FOR A 30P CHARGE WHICH CANNOT BE REFUNDED.\nAlso got to the bottom of the problem. Once a transaction is posted it cannot be cancelled, it can be refunded. This results in the categorisation ALWAYS remaining & therefore the appropriate fees are charged. That in itself creates a tortuous route - via chat or mail. In the first instance the assistance stick to the script & simply explain the system & therefore justifying the charges. The solutions suggested do not reverse the fees. It’s only if you effectively post a complaint that it’s escalated to a complaint & then it takes days to hear from someone who has the authority to waive the fees. All this takes time & perseverance; most users don’t pursue; PayPal generally pocket the 3% fee ( nice if you can get the work - for effectively nothing!). PayPal need to make two changes: if a claim for error is submitted it should be reviewed & if found to be correct then the incorrect transaction should be CANCELLED & REVERSED IN FULL - this would automatically refund the fees. Secondly the 30p charge should also be refunded where it I found that the original transaction was erroneous.

I had to resolve the issue on my own by refunding every transaction I had from my customers and for them to send back payments straight into my bank account because PayPal wasn’t linking it. I’ve called customer service for 5 straight days and no one was available. I’ve tried the message center but talking to a robot was no help. I’ve messaged PayPal on Facebook with a long and stressful message, only then was I able to speak to an actual person. If you’re reading this and are thinking of opening a PayPal account, I would suggest to try every possible way to link your debit cards, and bank accounts because that is the only way you will be able to get money out before PayPal steals it. Also, be sure that your phone number is able to receive SMS because without that, you will never be able to confirm it and confirming your phone number is a HUGE thing in the PayPal community. You must be SMART and because I first time using PayPal, I wasn’t fully educated. PayPal will give you the hardest time to receive any type of customer service, especially if you have a BIG AMOUNT OF MONEY in your PayPal balance. Reading hundreds to thousands of reviews, many people have this trouble and have had trouble for years and even up to this date they haven’t been solved. So really, there’s no resolution to anything unless you’re smart enough to help yourself. Now, I have a real person on PayPal Facebook trying to contact me to help me, after the fact that I found a way to take the money out of my account and wanting to close my account. Another note: they will do everything they can to have you not close it!

How the hell I'm supposed to know what I did wrong when you are not going to tell me and just take away my money . Won't reply to my emails , customer service is bunch of apes who only know ctrl c + ctrl v response. Most probably a cheap trick to scam people out of their money . Since then I have switched to Stripe and it's way better.

Each email blamed the merchant and then me for Paypal\'s double charge to my account. I even got a separate email blaming me for setting up the payment as a recurring charge when Paypal was responsible for it. Enough was enough.\n\nI tried to delete my Paypal account, only to be faced with three days of shenanigans from these filthy jackals. They wouldn\'t allow me to close my account because I had a non-existent "open case" which was not visible in my Paypal account. I was told to close the case but there was nothing to close. I sent them a message with screenshot of my case screen, it was ignored for two days. Finally I noticed a different case number in one of their emails. They never informed me that they had created another ticket. I had to do a search to find it, then I closed it.\n\nStill no luck deleting my account, with no explanation. I wrote them an email threatening legal action if my account isn\'t closed within 48 hours. That got their attention. It turns out that they had set up a year old one time payment as a recurring payment again, without my knowledge, just like the air conditioner, so that they could plunder my bank account at their leisure. Once again this "recurring payment" didn\'t appear anywhere in my profile. That was why I couldn\'t close my account.\n\nThese greedy, dishonest, sticky fingered weasels do not deserve access to anyone\'s cards or bank accounts. Thank God I\'m finally rid of them.\n================================\nI made the mistake of buying an air conditioner from a merchant website using Paypal. The thieves entered the transaction twice. I didn\'t have the funds in my account to cover the second charge, so my bank froze my account because of Paypal\'s "authorization hold". Almost two weeks later the extra hold still sits in my account and my funds are still frozen. When I tried to get Paypal to reverse the duplicate charge the arrogant criminals proceeded to lie that they weren\'t responsible and blame it on the merchant. They claimed to have contacted the merchant and stated that they refuse to reverse the second transaction for another two weeks "to wait for the merchant\'s response".\n\nI called the merchant and they had no record of the second transaction because they weren\'t the ones who put it through, so they couldn\'t reverse it. They also told me that Paypal never contacted them about my order. So they lied about that too. I went back to Paypal and they still refuse to take responsibility, claiming that they have a "process" which prevents them from doing anything for another TWO WEEKS. I told them that\'s not acceptable since they\'ve caused me to be blocked from accessing my own money and I need to buy groceries. I provided them with screenshots of the two transactions on their own website, as well as the transactions in my bank.\n\nSince then these crooks have been sending me text messages through their website several times a day, taunting me about their refusal to reverse the duplicate transaction, every day they send a countdown "eight days left", "seven days left" etc. and tell me to "watch my email". Since they refuse to reverse the duplicate transaction in a timely manner and I can\'t wait two weeks to get access to my money, I have applied for a chargeback with my credit card company and bank. They can explain to the merchant why they\'ve lost the value of an air conditioner, and they can pay the misuse of authorization hold and chargeback fees.', 'user': '5f7cf20fb0a0db0012238dad', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

If I was to say what i actually thought of paypal and its customer service It wouldn't be allowed to be on here! Words don't begin to cover how annoyed and frustrated I am. I sold an item via eBay been with paypal and ebay for numerous years aswell as im a regular seller. So decided to sell some motorcycle parts to put into my other project as they were taking up space so rather than have it sitting doing nothing i thought id sell. Everything was spot on buyers end fella was more than happy with the item left me great feedback but my end different story all together. After contacting PayPal 6 times after waiting over a week to get no where they said the money was on hold untill the buyer confirmed delivery and that he was happy via feedback. Once this was all done and received paypal stated they would then have to send an email to the already happy buyer to confirm that he was indeed happy with the item basicly stating I wasn't being honest wich wasn't much of an issue as there could always be an issue if someone says the item was not as described etc. Anyways that was never going to be the case so I thought I'd leave it be untill the buyer clarified everything once again! and he did this then freed up the money so it showed in my PayPal balance as available so I thought Great but it was short lived as i realised when I went to try and transfer the funds into my bank account. It was being held for another 24 hours as they need to do more checks im not being funny but how many more checks is there to actually do surely all the checks should have been done the week the money was held rather than when the money was made available surely were at the pont of no return now lol but like I said paypal says one thing and means another all together so basicly I can't access it unless I either spend it on ebay or wait until paypal do these other checks find it completely ridiculous and out of order considering the transfer i tried to do was to my actual bank account that I've used from the very start thats registerd in my name there quick enough to take payments out of zed account when I make a purchases in excess of £300-£1000 on parts etc. Theres no checks that need happen then to make sure its me spending the money via PayPal yet when I sell something and try to get my funds i get treated like I've hacked someone's account or im not who i say i am. What checks could paypal possibly have to do to verify the money is going into the same bank account as whats been registered since the very first day i opened the paypal account. Aswell as ive bought loads of items using the exact same card paypal shouldn't be allowed to continue trading as its fraud. Ive been more than fair with everything I've had to do paypal genuinely have more control over your money than you the actual seller have it shouldnt be this much of battle and there certainly shouldn't be this much red tape to get through after all the previous requirements. I've since took all my other parts off ebay id rather have them gathering dust in my garage than have to go through any of this carry on ever again every paypal representative is useless and unhelpfull. Also spoke to a paypal manager and he was about as much use as a fart in a space suit to be honest they all are id already jumped through more than enough hoops to make sure everything is safe and secure for me and the buyer yet I get treated like this even after the seller has confirmed everything is spot on.

Tickmill is getting a kickback from PayPal to force traders not be able to get a refund of there deposits to a PayPal connected credit card. So just by deposit money at Tickmill you will loose your money. Do Tickmill tell you that they will not refund your money NO. Not even if you ask customer service.They just like PayPal hide this fact from there costumer. And I suspect that Tickmill does the exact same thing with other pay wallets like Skrill and so on. It is a very clever way to scam you out of your money even if you are a profitable trader.\nPayPal do state that there costumer have the right to get a Refund if they ask for it. But Tickmill does not give refunds they only give payouts. OK SCAM!!!!\n\nThere must be 1000000 of other traders that have paid with PayPal and got scammed by there hidden currency fees.

When there's a dispute, it's usually straightforward and efficient in resolving them in your favour, particularly if you have lots of evidence and track all correspondence. The issue, however – and as many have already highlighted – is when trying to resolve a scam dispute. It appears that for some reason, PayPal is very passive, and instead of automatically actioning refunds amidst mounting evidence like banks do with similar disputes, they play along with the scammers' games and instruct you to return an item for way more than the refund amount to 'receive a refund' – only for said item to be returned because of the incorrect address the scammer supplied. Again, you have to be very vigilant, stern and forthright and challenge PayPal at every step in order to receive your full refund. It seems there's no human process involved in its dispute resolutions, which is why the experience appears clunky. They should take a leaf out of banks' books and actually have a team of people to review cases.", 'user': '6117c3d482f804001218a0d8', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

I ordered an item from a seller and paid via PayPal. The item never arrived. I raised a dispute with PayPal. In the meantime I contacted the Royal Mail who confirmed, after looking at their records, that the seller made a mistake and addressed the item to the wrong delivery address. This was, they told me, clearly shown on the tracking receipt given to the seller, but he refused to admit his error and would not respond to any contact from me. Unfortunately, because of data protection, the Royal Mail were unable to disclose the address the seller had incorrectly used.\n\nPayPal advised me to gain a letter from the Royal Mail confirming the item was never addressed to my address and then to upload this to the Resolution Centre so their back office staff could consider the evidence. It took a week, but I received the letter via email from the Royal Mail. However, the option to upload the letter to the PayPal Resolution Centre was not available to me. I rang PayPal to ask for assistance in uploading the document and was told that option didn't exist. I was told that there was no point in uploading or sending the letter to them as they wouldn't accept it or look at it as part of their dispute process. I queried this, as they were the ones that asked me to get the letter in the first place. I made it clear that the letter from the Royal Mail officially proved the seller made an error and that I never received the item. Still they told me this wouldn't be accepted. The only evidence they would look at is the Royal Mail tracking information, which of course states the item was successfully delivered (but to the wrong address of course)! After countless phone calls, messages via their Facebook service etc, they refused to accept the letter from the Royal Mail they asked for in the first place and closed the complaint in the seller's favour.\n\nUtterly despicable actions from a company that is weighted against the buyer. They operate within a moral vacuum. There is no right of appeal against their decision either. I have now had to lodge a formal complaint against them with the financial ombudsman here in the UK. Based on my experience, my advice to anyone thinking of using PayPal would be to give them a wide berth. Use your credit or debit card instead. At least your bank or credit card company will have a fair and lawful dispute and resolution process in place which will consider all of the evidence available. Unfortunately, from my experience, it would appear the staff are like drones, only able to read from pre-written call scripts with no ability to deviate. They simply repeat the same sentences over and over again or provide knowingly inaccurate instructions / guidance simply to get you off the phone. I spoke to one manager and asked her 'how do you sleep at night knowing that you are deliberately deceiving customers that are just trying to do the right thing. How can you settle disputes against them, even when proof or evidence exists in their favour'....her reply 'because that's the process sir'. Absolutely priceless!

In any other 'real world' situation, it would have been the responsibility of the bank to return the money to the buyer; it's covered by insurance. Despite the fact that I had no involvement in the fraud, Paypal took the money back from me. I have no bed and no money (I'm unemployed, and really need that money) and have wasted hours trying to get it back.\nThe financial ombudsman supports my case but that doesn't mean I will get my money back.\nOne of the biggest problems I experienced was with Paypal communications. It's clear that the people I interacted with did not fully understand English - this caused a lot of problems when I was trying to explain my side of the story. (Part of me also wonders if Paypal coaches the customer service team to deliberately misunderstand communications in order to stop customers from complaining). Examples include customer services asking me several times for information I'd already supplied. They didn't read my messages, when I spoke to them on the phone they were constantly misunderstanding things I said.\nAll-in-all, their inability to understand what I was saying led to them concluding that the case was not in my favour. (Even though the case wasn't against me!)\nFrom what I've read on-line, 1000s of people have had similar Ebay/Paypal experiences. Because of this, I am looking into taking legal action against Paypal. If anyone reads this and wants to raise a similar case against Paypal, get in touch. I think it's time companies like this (who don't pay their taxes), are held to account.", 'user': '6059cc597d888b00136eabea', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

So basically, they can claim your money indefinitely.\n- Per violation, they can withhold 2500$ of your funds to cover any damages that may incur.\n\nAlone these terms make sense.

I work 100% online as a freelance designer. I travel frequently, especially in Mexico and Central America. I get locked out of my US PayPal business and personal accounts frequently, simply because I access my account from foreign IP address. I am a US citizen who owns a US business, paid by businesses in the US, in US dollars, to a US bank account. I\'ve been with PayPal for 9 years. If you want to say "I\'ve never a problem with PayPal," you need to wake up and read these comments. For nine years, I didn\'t have a problem with PayPal, either. Trust me, your time will come, and when it comes...it really comes. Ironically, the only time Paypal worries about my identity is when I transfer money to my bank account. I am free to make purchases all day long. When I called PayPal Customer Service recently from Mexico, PayPal CS literally told me to "open a PayPal in Mexico"--kind of hard to do when my business isn\'t Mexican, I own no property in Mexico, and I don\'t have (or need) a Mexican bank account.', 'user': '60c23d315829a90019e5ce90', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

I then had to contact them as it was going to make me wait a further 4 days for a code because my bank doesn't accept withdrawals yet as I had not confirmed it. It says they add spending and withdrawal limits. There is absolutely no guidance available anywhere produced by them that shows you how to do these complicated steps to get money. Its my own money? I shouldn't have to wait that long to use my own money in my account rather than through paypal. It charged me a pound to get the code for my bank and it came out straight away and said i had to wait four days to recieve it. If somebody desperately needed to receive money they'd be in a mess.
