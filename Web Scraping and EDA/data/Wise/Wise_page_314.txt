{'platform': 'Wise', 'id': '6466c4e2f96494fce60065e0', 'stars': 1, 'title': '(Wise repeatedly suspended incoming…', 'message': '(Wise repeatedly suspended incoming transfers from my main clients in Germany for no reason. The apologetic customer service never answered my questions. I’m out)\n\nPart 2: For the past five days, I\'ve been attempting to resolve this issue by contacting customer service multiple times. However, like most customer service representatives, they only offer sympathetic phrases such as "I understand your frustration." The information I received from Wise is actually quite alarming. It appears that Wise utilizes artificial intelligence to identify suspicious or fraudulent transactions. Strangely enough, after five years of recurring transfers from my German client to my Californian company, the system suddenly flagged something as "suspicious". This is perplexing, as the transfers have always included a sequence of letters and numbers that serve as my client\'s accounting references. Despite my client\'s explanation of these references, the transfer and the associated funds vanished without a trace. When I inquired about the whereabouts of the money, the staff at Wise were unable to provide any answers. Subsequently, some technical individuals claiming to represent Wise contacted me, and we spent numerous hours attempting to rectify the issues with my account. This interrupted my work multiple times as these people apparently needed to remotely access my account via my computer. Unfortunately, they were unsuccessful. At this point, it remains unclear whether the money is being returned to my client, returned to my account, or stuck in limbo. The staff at this supposedly remarkable bank have been unable to provide me with any information, and after five days, my money has yet to be returned, as is the case with my client. I have been calling Wise twice daily, explaining the situation to their customer service, but for five days, no one has been able to resolve my problem. When entrusting my finances to a financial institution, I expect a significantly higher level of service. This unprofessionalism raises serious concerns about the security and safety of my funds. Undoubtedly, this has been the most dreadful banking experience of my life, and I strongly caution others against using Wise. Considering the harm caused to my company and the strain on my relationship with my client, I am now pursuing legal action against Wise.', 'review_date': '2023-05-19', 'review_time': '02:37:54', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
