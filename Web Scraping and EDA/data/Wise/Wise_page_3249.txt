We do support sending the local currency in New Zealand so sending NZD via SWIFT wouldn't be possible even nor something we offer.\n\nFrom your transaction, we can see this was a money to email type of payment. The transfer was cancelled because the recipient never got back to us with their bank details, so we couldn't complete the payment from our side. When that happens we can't keep your money, so we'll refund you.\n\nWe have also told you on an email sent on May 10th that we were waiting to hear from your recipient.\n\nAll the best,\nWise Team.", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2021-05-20', 'CompanyReplyTime': '07:51:04'}
