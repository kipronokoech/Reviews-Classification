Now I have complete confidence in Wise, and have used it for substantial amounts too, such as when I sold my company shares and was paid in USD or another time in Euros, having a virtual account in these currencies I was able to use it to receive the sale price (so no hefty deductions to receive it in “foreign currency”) then transfer them to my local UK bank account at very favourable exchange rates. I saved a lot of money doing so. Also, adding money to the Wise Visa card and using it abroad which basically works like a local card wherever you are (sadly not in Iceland - not Wise’s fault…), saved me a significant amount of money too, bearing in mind what my own bank charges for the use of my debit or credit cards outside of the UK.\nThe app works great too, there isn’t anything that you can do on the desktop version but can’t do with the app (or if there is, I haven’t come across it).\nI regularly transfer money for family members overseas and it’s there within minutes, or hours at worst, any day of the week, any tine of the day. I can also pay their utility bills using TransferWise, directly to the service providers, no problem (it’s not compulsory to use Direct Debits where they live).\nI have used the Visa card for online purchases too, such as when eBay was charging me in Euros at ridiculous exchange rates for something in Ireland, or bought stuff from the US.\nThe possibilities to save money with TransferWise are endless, really. It’s not always a lot you save, but it all adds up.\nThe one thing I don’t like is the change of its name, TransferWise had a ring to it while Wise not so much… but hey.\nAll in all, I would not be without TransferWise (to me it’s still its name, it has made my life so much easier and saved me a lot of money and headache over the years.\nLong may it continue to operate this way.', 'review_date': '2022-07-31', 'review_time': '09:36:37', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

We previously used normal bank transfers to transfer money from the UK to Greece, and they were ok mostly. But the rate you got on the day was quite poor, the cost of doing it therefore more than with WISE and the transfer took literally days where you were wondering when it would actually arrive! A friend introduced us to WISE and it has been a revelation. The Apps and system is slick, easy and very very fast (seconds instead of days), the rate is very good and the whole experience stress free. Why would I ever go back?
