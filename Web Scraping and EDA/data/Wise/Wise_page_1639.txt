Wise have full debit card banking services, and you can open cash accounts in multiple currencies and if desired, (and legal where you live) in multiple countries. You can get multiple debit cards on any of these accounts, (useful if you need one for other family members, or a "one-off" online purchase where you don\'t trust the retailer not to rip off your card).\nIn short, a perfect banking service for anyone who travels, or has relatives overseas.', 'review_date': '2022-06-04', 'review_time': '06:05:52', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
