While they have consistently provided reliable and affordable options, there are certain areas that require improvement, particularly their customer support.\n\nWISE has been my go-to choice for their dependable and efficient service. Their commitment to reliability, affordability, and speedy transactions has made them stand out in the market. I have always appreciated the convenience they offer, ensuring my money reaches its destination quickly and securely.\n\nHowever, the recent introduction of a verification process for long-time users has left me disappointed. It seems ironic that after being a loyal customer for so long, I encountered difficulties during the verification process, and WISE's customer support failed to address the issue effectively. The lack of proper assistance and guidance was frustrating, and it left me feeling neglected as a valued customer.\n\nAnother concern I have is the limited means of communication for customer support. Relying solely on Facebook Messenger for sensitive document exchanges raises security concerns. It would be much more reassuring to have alternative channels such as email or phone calls available for addressing any issues or inquiries.\n\nIn conclusion, WISE has been a reliable and affordable choice for international transfers. However, the recent verification process and inadequate customer support have dampened my overall experience. I hope that WISE takes these concerns seriously and works towards enhancing their customer support and providing more secure communication channels for their valued users.\n\nNote: This review is based on my personal experience as a long-time user of WISE and may not reflect the experiences of others.", 'review_date': '2023-06-04', 'review_time': '11:38:30', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nJun 5, 2023\nHi there,\n\nThanks for sharing your honest feedback as a long-time user of Wise.

Clarity of pictures is always an issue and it has been the same in my case this time again. The automatic validation rejected my pictures twice while they weren't so bad and quite readable. Very frustrating and a message telling that should I fail to provide a proper picture within 48h, funds sent to my account would be bounced. Unsettling. Should I rate this, it would be one star or perhaps no star at all.\nHowever, it took only one email for my Identification to be approved a few hours later. That's what I'm rating four stars.\nThe downside is that I wasn't informed of the approval, I just found out that the warning banner on my account front page had disappeared and I had to request a confirmation through another email.
