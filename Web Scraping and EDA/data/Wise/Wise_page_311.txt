I am currently confronted first-hand with all the above listed flaws, as my latest large transfer to Thailand has now been delayed for 13 days and counting, with no useful support, no proper follow-up and no date for a solution... Just appalling service and company... The worst part of it is that Wise is blaming their local partner, with whom I am in contact in writing and which confirmed they do not have any technical issue and did indicate that, on the basis of all information at my disposal, Wise simply does not seem to have processed the said transfer (I asked Wise on the phone for a written proof of submission of the transfer to their partner in Thailand, but they refused to share anything - one may see this as a confession). Hiding behind dubious reasons definitely feels suspicious... Hence, be very careful, as it does not seems safe and wise to trust Wise with your money at this moment (pun definitely intended)...", 'review_date': '2023-05-23', 'review_time': '21:59:52', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nMay 22, 2023\nHi Cédric,\n\nWe're sorry to hear that your experience has been less than ideal and would like to address your concerns.

The exchange rates are way better than my bank was offering and there aren't any hidden fees. Setting up transfers is pretty straightforward in the app and the money shows up in my recipient's account almost instantly.\n\nBut there are some issues. The currency conversion rates aren't always the best I've seen - they claim to give mid-market rates but I've found slightly better deals elsewhere sometimes. The mobile app could also be more intuitive and convenient. It takes a few too many clicks to log in, find past transfers, or view account history.\n\nOverall though, I'd recommend Wise if you need to send money abroad often. It will likely save you a significant amount versus using your bank. And the customer service has been responsive the few times I've had to contact them for help. But there's definitely room for improvement on conversion rates, app functionality and adding more payment options.\n\nSo I'd give Wise like 4 out of 5 stars. A decent product but with notable shortcomings that Wise needs to address if they want to be the go-to solution for sending money globally. The foundations are there, they just need to fill in the gaps to make the experience truly seamless for users like me.", 'review_date': '2023-05-20', 'review_time': '05:23:36', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
