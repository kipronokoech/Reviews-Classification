Unfortunately, my experience has been nothing short of a nightmare, and I feel compelled to share my frustration to warn others.\n\nI had eagerly signed up for their service, expecting a seamless and efficient process. However, it has been over a month, and I still haven't received my account details. From the beginning, the communication has been abysmal. I was initially informed that the delay was due to technical issues, but I was assured that the problem would be resolved within a matter of days. Needless to say, those days turned into weeks, and I am still left without any resolution.\n\nWhat exacerbates the issue is the lack of responsiveness from their customer support team. Despite sending numerous emails seeking clarification and assistance, I have yet to receive a single reply (I do not count the automatic replies they sent each time). It's as if my concerns and frustrations are simply being ignored, adding insult to injury. This level of disregard for customer inquiries is utterly unacceptable and highlights a blatant disregard for basic customer service principles.\n\nThe importance of reliable and timely customer service cannot be overstated. When problems arise, customers should feel supported and confident that their concerns will be addressed promptly. Unfortunately, this company has failed to deliver on these expectations, leaving me feeling helpless and taken advantage of.\n\nTo those considering their services, I implore you to look elsewhere. Based on my own personal experience, I cannot recommend relying on this company's services. Their failure to deliver on their promises and their complete lack of responsiveness to customer inquiries are red flags that should not be ignored.\n\nIn conclusion, this has been an incredibly frustrating and disappointing experience. Terrible customer service, prolonged delays, and a complete lack of communication have left me with a bitter taste in my mouth. Spare yourself the frustration and disappointment and seek out a company that values its customers and provides the level of service they deserve.\n\nEdit: I have realized I missed one email they sent on June 2. They said they had to close my USD account due to regulatory requirements. I have no idea what regulatory requirements are. I have been utilizing this account without encountering any problems. I have successfully received money on multiple occasions using the same account. Now, they inform me that regulatory requirements have led to the closure of my USD account details. Customers rely on their service and make plans based on that trust.", 'review_date': '2023-06-06', 'review_time': '08:44:40', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nJun 6, 2023\nHi there,\n\nWe appreciate you taking the time to share your experience and frustrations with us.
