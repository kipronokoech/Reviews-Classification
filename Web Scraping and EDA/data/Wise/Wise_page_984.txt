But if something happens, your fund will be in limbo, which could be held indefinitely by the Company. Wise doesn\'t treat customer fairly. They would let you transfer your fund despite knowing that your account requires certain KYC updates. So once your fund is locked in with them, you will be required to submit relevant supporting docs, and your transfer will be "paused" until verification is done, which can take 1-2 business days or weeks. If you are lucky, transfer will go through in 1-2 days, otherwise, your fund will be gone for quite some times. Imagine if it is urgent money, or someone relies on it to survive, it\'s going to be a very frustrating and stressful experience. Imagine transferring $10k to your parents for medical bills, and the money goes missing for a month... This is fraudulent practice in the name of regulatory compliance. How can Wise accept fund from clients knowing that their accounts need to be verified in the first place? Verification should be done before any transfer can take place.', 'review_date': '2022-10-03', 'review_time': '11:27:07', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
