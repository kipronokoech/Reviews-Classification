I was puzzled by the fact that when I went to "my Euro account", it gave me an IBAN, BIC, that I can apparently use to accept euros. But when I go to "add euros" via bank transfer, it gives a different IBAN/BIC.\n\nI tried to transfer euros using the first "My Euro Account" button and that didn\'t work. Probably my bank\'s fault. But I also wanted to know if the two IBANS always stay the same, since it is a hassle setting up an international online transfer facility with my bank (I have to present myself at their office to set up new IBANs for foreign accounts, and then I can make the transfers online)\n\nI opted for a chat to try to find out what went wrong, I have to say that the chat was frustrating. I don\'t know how many converstaions the poor support person had open at the time, but it was very slow, and at one point he/she asked if my currency was Moroccan somethings. That didn\'t make sense; was probably relted to a different conversation he/she was having.\n\nSo you get 3 stars because it\'s a good service overall, but the chat service needs some serious work.', 'review_date': '2021-11-27', 'review_time': '16:53:00', 'CompanyReply': 'Reply from Wise\nDec 24, 2021\nHello, Mark.\n\nWhen you open EUR balances with us, we\'ll give you an unique IBAN and this will always remain the same. You\'ll use this IBAN to send money to yourself or to receive money from third parties by sharing your IBAN with them.\n\nHowever, when you click "Add money", you\'ll see our IBAN there. That\'s because, by clicking "Add money", you are first sending us your money (to our EUR bank account), and once received, we\'ll add the money to your EUR balances.\n\nThat option is available because we don\'t support bank account details to all the currencies we offer, but you can still top-up your account using the "add money" button.\n\nWhile your unique IBAN will always remain the same, ours can change as we have different bank partners. We recommend that you don\'t save our details automatically.\n\nWise.', 'CompanyReplyDate': '2021-12-24', 'CompanyReplyTime': '09:43:24'}
