It sounds like your payment went through checks, and if you don't get back to us with the needed details, we have to cancel the payment, because we can't hold onto it for too long. Refunds can take up to 10 business days, depending on how you sent the money to us.\n\nWhile our goal is to complete all payments as fast as we can, weâ€™re a regulated financial institution and as such, we need to carry extra checks on transfers from time to time. This is a routine procedure to help us ensure weâ€™re keeping our platform safe for everyone using (including you) while complying with local regulations.\n\nIf you need help with a specific transfer, you can always contact us here: https://wi.se/contactus_ or Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram with your email and user number.
