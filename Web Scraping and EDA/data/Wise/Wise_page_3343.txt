No problem ever, and even when something was getting a little bit slow, I'd get very helpful support.\n\nHowever, after using it for one year (or more), and after starting to get a better reputation and more (WAY MORE) users, the service officially started to go down.\n\nFirst, on January 1st I get a message saying I need to verify my data - which, btw, I had validated once in the past (guess somebody reset some server cache?). Second, some transactions get stuck, randomly - even ones with 30-50 euros can get stuck, and it can take 4-5 days, even though initially the expected (advertised) time is 12 hours.\n\nI already complained they should be able to detect when one transaction is going to take slower than usually (although it's silly to think 30-50 euros can represent a security risk). But basically put my feedback in the garbage can.\n\nIf I wanted SLOW transactions, I could as well use my old bank (which, btw, can do international transactions in 2 days, as opposed to 4-5).", 'review_date': '2021-04-14', 'review_time': '17:18:12', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nApr 20, 2021\nThanks for sharing your feedback with us, Carlos.\n\nWhile we aim to complete all payments as fast as possible, verification is a very important step for us.
