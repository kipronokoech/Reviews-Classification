This in any way affected the speed our payments or how we're offering our services to you.\n\nThe speed of your transfer can be affected by a few things: we might need to carry verification/financial checks, or even the payment was set up over the weekend/holidays. As most banks are not processing payments then, this can cause delays.\n\nNo matter the reason, we'll always keep you updated along the way.\n\nAll the best,\nWise Team.", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2021-05-20', 'CompanyReplyTime': '11:52:36'}
