As long as you have used the correct account details, the money will reach you.\n\nA proof of payments is requested when you get in touch asking for updates on the transfer. We ask this document, so we can't see when was the money sent, which type of payment was used and if the account details are correct. It's not needed, but we'll ask you should you get in touch, because that's the only way we can investigate on an incoming payment. Otherwise, you just need to wait for their processing time, and the money will reach you.\n\nWise.", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2021-10-11', 'CompanyReplyTime': '11:19:51'}
