But when I tried to transfer money into my own PayPal account. It never reached and instead my wise account is deactivated without any prior notice or warning. Was asked for some details, provided But only to be told that account is closed and I'll have to wait for some diligence checks to be completed which will take 60 working days and then my money will be released. It's over £5K which is all I had in saving. Customer services wouldn't respond. Seems as suddenly you're trapped in some remote island and can't get help at all. My advice is, stay well clear, it's a honey trap. High Street banking is far more reliable and trustworthy. If you've to use it, make only small deposit which wouldn't hurt you if it's locked away without any access.
