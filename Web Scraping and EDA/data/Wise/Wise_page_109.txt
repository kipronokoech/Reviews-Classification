I have had to deal with a lot of different software solutions, CRM's and other solutions that will eventually require support. Wise is by far the most disorganized, decentralized and lackluster communication oriented support system I have ever experienced. I want to be clear, the support staff are courteous and honestly seem to do their best in helping the customer, but they are completely hamstringed to do their jobs. Want to escalate and talk to a manager/supervisor, sorry they don't have any. Want to confirm with the verification team to check status on process, sorry, they don't have the ability to do that. Want to talk the the person you talked with the first time or just have someone that knows what's going on so you don't have to explain the same thing over and over and over, sorry, they can't either see who it was or have no ability to contact them. Just want to get an email reply on status, sorry must wait at minimum 24 hours just to get a response that doesn't answer your question and most likely repeats something already covered or a solution that doesn't work. Want to chat with them online for some 'quick' help, NOPE, that option is grayed out for most. Want to call them on the phone, prepare to wait at least an hour (doesn't matter when you call). Want to hear the support staff tell you that they 'understand your frustration, but we are working on this and will get back to you when we know more, please be patient' - you are in luck, they will say that on the 8th day even though they said it would take 1 to 2 days.
