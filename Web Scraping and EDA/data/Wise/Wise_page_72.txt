I\'ve referred family and friends to Wise too. They were "unable to verify the source of my funds" since there seems to be no allowance in their system for someone to have savings more than 12 months old, as a source of funds. I contacted them repeatedly before the deadline to either complete the verification or, if they were unable to verify me, I\'d have ample time to withdraw my funds and carry on. Despite repeated attempts to contact them (and they\'re claimed 1 day response time), it\'s been over a week since I\'ve heard anything a word from them. When one logs in, typically you can see if you have pending documents to be submitted. Since my last document submission, that warning went away, so after my last document submission and the lack of warning, and no response from customer service, I assumed I may be in the clear. Now of course, I have 5 figures locked since they\'ve suspended my account, and now the warning is back. Still, no response from Wise. It really is beginning to feel like a scam from a company that supposedly has a banking license in the UK.
