Using account I withdraw money from my bank account a I was able to send wire payment to Australia with charges of just few Euros. It is amazing amount of time I would lose in the bank and about 10 times less in fees.\n\nSecond part arrived in mail about 5 days after I signed up. That was my green WISE Visa. I loaded some Euros into that card and went shopping. Not only card worked flawlessly but WISE exchanged EUR into HRK at better rate than my Reiffesen bank! In surprise I went to buy single loaf of bread and same thing happened. I actually saved some money on that transaction as well. I have Scotia Bank Visa, PBZ Visa, BMO Elite Master card and Reiffesen Master. I think I will dump all those cards in favor of WISE card. Maybe not BMO Elite since it gives me insurance, and lost baggage protections and car insurance. But rest of them will go.', 'review_date': '2021-10-25', 'review_time': '11:42:36', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
