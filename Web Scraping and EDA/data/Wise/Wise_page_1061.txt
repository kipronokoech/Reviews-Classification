May recomendation, you can use this bank onley like a slat, when you need, but dont keep many there dont use them as main bank, you will get in so big problems, and contact with them are wery hard and long. My recomendation, use any other bank as Revalut, Paysera, or 1000 more banks in this area, if you dnt want that your account is closed in one day withaut any explanations, wornings, information or so one. By the wy, if there is problem, you can not eaven get in contact with them to understand situation.', 'review_date': '2022-09-19', 'review_time': '02:29:33', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nSep 19, 2022\nHello, Uldis\n\nSorry to hear your account was deactivated. We do understand that this can be frustrating. However, this isn't something we take lightly, and it's never done without a reason. It's normally a result of a conflict with our Terms of Service or Customer Agreement, or due to a discrepancy with a financial law. We can't share the exact reason of the deactivation, due to how we're regulated. However, you can find some possible reasons here wi.se/accountdeactivation.\n\nIf you're not happy with this decision, you can appeal here https://wi.se/-appeal, and our appeals team will reach out to you once they have further updates regarding your account. Please keep in mind that this process might take up to 20 working days.\n\nAs for your remaining money in your account, we'll work on sending it back to you. But first, we need to carry out due diligence checks. While we do that, your money and information will be safe and secure.\n\nWise", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2022-09-19', 'CompanyReplyTime': '11:31:34'}
