We can't always share the exact reason of the deactivation, due to how we're regulated. However, you can find some possible reasons here wi.se/accountdeactivation.\n\nIf you think we made a mistake, you can make an appeal about our decision with these steps: https://wi.se/howtoreactivatemyaccount_. Our specialized team we‚Äôll review your request and get back to you by email as soon as we can.\n\nRest assured ‚Äî your money is safe. When we close an account with balances on it, we need to carry out security checks first. Once these checks are completed, we always get in touch about the refund.\n\nWe run these checks to verify the information you gave us.
