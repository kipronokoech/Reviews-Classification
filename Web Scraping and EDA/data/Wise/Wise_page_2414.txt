You might imagine how Wise could be useful for a person like me and how many euros it saved moving money through different accounts.\n\nEverything worked more or less smoothly until this month I started preparing my balances to make some Christmas gift to my family, so I moved some funds from my polish account to the euro one. Such transfers take usually few seconds but this one appeared to be slower than usual: I thought it would be due to the weekend so I waited till Monday to have an update. With my surprise, nothing moved on the first working day of the week, neither the day after.\n\nHere it comes my experience with the support team of Wise: despite they were very fast identifying the issue of my transfer (it is under manual review for some checks) the service was basically useless as they're unable to speed up the process, advising to wait a little bit until the transfer is released. How about them advising Wise to keep up with their delivery time promises, particularly in a crucial time frame like the Christmas one?\n\nWorth to keep in mind that as a customer, I already provided an ID, a selfie and a bank statement as part of routine checks.\n\nOn top of that, here it comes the bitter part of the service, the one which is not advertised by Wise on their website: routine checks might take 2-10 days (confirmed by their CS Team), and asking for a refund won't help either, as this take as well 2-10 working days. Routine check are done after a transfer is funded. Wise claims it usually take less than that, but how can a customer plan an action with such generic time frame?\n\nWhile 7 years ago this perhaps could have been still an acceptable service to give to customers, right now competition is becoming way more efficient, and even banks are cutting down most of the commission which just few years ago seemed to be awful. Actually, if I knew Wise could hold any of my transfer for 4 days, I would use my bank instead (which yes they might charge a bit more, yes they might not be transparent with their fee structure but they won't hold transactions randomly. By the way Wise fee structure is becoming not that transparent either).\n\nDespite the very good reputation Wise has as a money transfer company, companies changes over time and with them services as well. It's enough to just look below in this page and notice that Wise doesn't even bother to reply to customer's reviews. In fact as a customer, you might want to watch around for the best deal available, particularly keeping into account that Wise stopped being the cheapest money transfer company a long time ago.", 'review_date': '2021-12-21', 'review_time': '08:18:36', 'CompanyReply': 'Reply from Wise\nFeb 3, 2022\nHello Alessandro,\n\nWhile our goal is to complete all payments as fast as we can, we’re a regulated financial institution and as such, we need to carry extra checks on transfers from time to time.

Unfortunately when I needed to make a transfer from US to Germany, we are getting a complete run around with zero help.\n\nWe tested the transfer initially with $100 since it was between a new account Germany and it went through. We then entered the actual transfer (Thursday) and initially it appeared to go through normally.. however on Friday we received a notice that they needed proof that the sending account was the same person (it is.. just set up as a trust). I sent all the files of the trust showing it was set up with the same two people as listed on the personal account. Nothing happened over the weekend. Monday i chatted with customer service and they didn't even know what the problem was and literally could not help in any way.\n\nTuesday I called the customer service (only open 10-2 EST...). Spoke with a representative that said we have to set up a business account although we don't have a business... He told us it was what was needed to get the money transferred over. I created a business account and he told us that was all that was needed and it would be a very simple transfer on their end and it would process on Tuesday or Wednesday at the very latest. Thursday we contacted Wise again to understand what is going on with no help and missed being able to call on Friday because of the horrible business hours of 10-2. In the meantime Wise keeps sending cancellation emails of our transfer that we were told to ignore...and we were told the money (if returned) would not even arrive back to us for 3-5 business days!!!)\n\nToday is Monday, 11 days since Wise has had our money... We spoke with three different people today (one disconnected the call after placing us on hold to look into it) and once again we were told to sit on our hands and wait until they resolve the problem. I have wasted hours of time to save a little bit of money in transfer fees. There is zero help or experience from WISE if there is any issue whatsoever. I would steer clear and would not recommend WISE unless you have lots of extra time to try and sort it out. (By the way tomorrow on day 12 is the earliest the money can now arrive in Germany...
