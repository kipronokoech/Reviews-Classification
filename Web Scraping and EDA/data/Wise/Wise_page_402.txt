You can still reach us via phone/email at https://wi.se/contactus_ or on social media channels and we'll do our best to help.\n\nFor our card delivery, if you chose the standard option, we're unable to track your card delivery. Some deliveries may take longer than usual, so we'd recommend waiting a week past the estimated timeframe to see if it reaches you, as occasionally there are postal delays: https://wi.se/mywisecardhasntarrived_\n\nAlso, please double-check that you entered a correct and detailed delivery address. If you have to re-order the card, you can try using a different address (for example, a work address or relative's address) or choose to speed up the delivery with DHL, so you can track your order.

I migrated to the USA soon after and attempted to verify my address but unfortunately the proof I was using wasn‚Äôt accepted. I had no accounts in the United States prior so wise was going to be my main account. Because of the verification issue I simply went to a bank here with the same proof wise declined and opened an account in minutes.

But there's a major caveat which shouldn't be missed:\n\nIf any of your transactions trigger a manual review which, for whatever reason, take longer than a day, they lock down your entire account and stop processing any pending and new transactions.\n\nI've hat such a situation twice in the past year and every time it took several weeks (!) to get my account unlocked again, even though I told them within 2 days that they should just cancel the transactions in question if they can't process them.\n\nI was flooded with patronizing canned texts from various customer support agents. Support agents claim that they have no say in manual review tasks and can't even speak to the people in charge of them. Which leaves me as a customer lost with a locked down account that my business depends on.\n\nTo put the issue in context: I'm a heavy user of their platform with transactions way over a hundred thousand dollars each month to pay my staff. Yet it's made impossible to talk to anyone at wise who can expedite or escalate business-critical issues or make any time-critical decisions regarding my account.\n\nI believe their manual verification process is broken and that makes them unsuitable for business banking.\n\nI can't afford to delay my monthly payments to my staff for weeks without any logical reasons.
