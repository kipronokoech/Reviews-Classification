Wise customer service has been horrendous the only information given is that his bank is under a review check, he has been treated like a criminal with thousands of pounds saved to go on this honey moon locked with no explanation. My honey moon has been ruined due to the lack of communication or explanation from this bank, no time frame has been given either or requests for any obligatory information they may need to carry out any checks after weeks of using this new bank.

The worst is when you contact the help service by chat, they always give same answer that it is a routine check. No one cares about what the client is going through.\nTill mow as i am speaking my funds are still there and under routine check as they claim, this can be and really is frustrating as no one can tell you anything. They will keep saying backroom staff. At least the clients will always want to talk to someone that can help. In Revolut its the other way round and Bunq bank, very helpful. I have a feeling WISE have so much clients and don‚Äôt care.\nI am here still waiting for WISE to complete the sole called routine check .', 'review_date': '2022-06-22', 'review_time': '14:04:35', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
