They offer multi-currency business accounts and very low-cost transfers.\n\nHowever, when something goes wrong (as it has), it goes badly wrong.

I sent the documents on November 22nd, two days before their deadline.\n\nAs of December 6th, they have not acknowledged receipt of my documents, they have not verified my account, and they do not respond to emails – the only support channel they currently offer. My money is frozen; I cannot receive incoming transfers or make payments. I cannot transfer my money out.\n\nFor a small business such as mine, this is extremely costly and stressful. I find this entirely unacceptable and as soon as this is resolved I will be moving my business elsewhere.
