When we close an account with money on it, we need to carry due diligence checks first. Once these checks are completed, we always get in touch about the refund.\n\nDue diligence checks are conducted to verify the information you have provided to us. We are required to do these at all stages of the customer relationship, not just during the initial onboarding stage, so this means during the customer relationship as well as during the deactivation stage.\n\nHowever, these checks may take quite long, since we need to check every piece of information.

To their credit - that was mostly very clear and painless, although I did have issues with one of the items.

I could not use EFT or wire money from my Fidelity check account (which is down to Fidelity I believe after checking with them) and could not use my debit card (Wise can't or won't use US issued debit cards if your address is overseas - so no good for US expats, see link in their reply below). I'm not going to pay the fees that a credit card would charge - very expensive option. So in my case it was a huge waste of time and frustration (and a risk of my personal information).
