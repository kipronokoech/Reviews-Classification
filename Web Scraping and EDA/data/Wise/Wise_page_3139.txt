The interface was pretty intuitive and transfers worked smoothly. I very much appreciate the cost transparency.\n\nHowever. I\'m purchasing a house in the UK for which I need to transfer a very large amount of money. I transferred about half of the money to Wise when the transfer was flagged by the "large transfer team" as requiring more documentation about the source of the funds and so on. This seems completely reasonable, and I provided documentation to support the legitimacy of the source of the funds.\n\nA couple of days later I got a really frustrating email in which Wise said they needed additional information. The specific questions they asked had already been answered in the original documentation I provided, but I provided it again with slightly more elaboration to point out where in the documentation the specific record they wanted was.\n\nAfter another day of waiting, I raised the issue in chat help but got nowhere because the matter was with the large transfers team, nothing the chat assistant could do.\n\nAfter yet another day of waiting, I\'ve cancelled the transfer to Wise and have found better options for doing this very large transfer.\n\nI want to emphasize that I have no problem with the requirement that I provide documentation to help Wise understand what I\'m doing and follow anti-money-laundering rules. But I really needed more responsive support from them. At the point at which I cancelled I still didn\'t have any feeling at all about whether Wise would be willing to work with me on effecting the transfer.\n\nUpdate in response to Wise\'s answer:\n\nI do understand about this taking time. But I disagree that there wasn\'t anything you could do. You could have communicated with me more effectively. Given that this was taking longer than the 1-3 business days I was led to expect, a simple email at the 3 business day mark seems a minimum courtesy that could be expected. I would have been okay with it taking longer than 3 business days if I had a sense that Wise was willing to work with me. Given my subsequent experience with a more responsive and helpful company (Currencies Direct), my expectation is that more documentation would have been required from me. But it isn\'t okay for information requests to be separated by more than two days, especially when those requests leave it unclear what the actual documentation requirements are. If a back and forth is required, then at some point someone needs to reach out for an actual real-time discussion.', 'review_date': '2021-06-18', 'review_time': '10:42:37', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nJun 18, 2021\nSorry to hear about your experience, Mark.\n\nWe aim to complete those checks as fast as we can, but it might take a bit longer than we first expected. We're a regulated financial institution, complying with strict laws all around the globe. We need to make sure we're following those regulations, and because of that, compliance checks might not be completed as fast as we'd like.\n\nSupport is more than happy to help you, but we can't speed up nor process payments. If the transfer is undergoing checks, there is no action we can take from our side.\n\nAll the best,\nWise Team", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2021-06-18', 'CompanyReplyTime': '09:27:45'}
