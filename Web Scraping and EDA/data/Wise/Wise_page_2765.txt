I require it show as an international transfer monthly for my visa. To do this I need to utilize Bangkok Bank but it takes generally 32 hour from when they start the process to entering my Thai BkB account.

As a family with three-nationalities that moves between three countries (one in Europe, one in Africa, and the USA) it was a lifesaver. Suddenly this year we had 10,000 Euros frozen and my husband's account closed. Little communication. No recourse. Now I cannot transfer money either, it just sits in holding and then comes back as not possible. Prior to this experience it would have been a 5 star review, but this year we learned that we are just a number. Great concept, but unless you can protect our money and communicate properly, it's not worth the risk. *Prior to this year my complaint previously would be that when you hold money in different currencies, it doesn't earn interest, which it should.\n\n*Edit to add that in regarding the terms of use, I believe that the error lay in him using a personal account for business purposes, as he did 1 & 2, but only had a personal account. If that is the case, then where is the communication asking him to open a business account? Having had his funds frozen, and account closed, he has zero interest in appealing. Your process lost him as a customer. Perhaps this review will serve to help someone else avoid the same experience.\n\nFrom Wise terms of use:\n1 receiving payments from family, friends or other people you know for personal purposes (ok);\n2 receiving payments from your clients and other third parties for the purpose of business payments (ok).\n3 You may not use your personal Wise account to receive business payments (not ok).", 'review_date': '2021-10-11', 'review_time': '12:36:28', 'CompanyReply': 'Reply from Wise\nOct 11, 2021\nHello Alison,\n\nWe understand having your account closed is frustrating, but rest assured this is never done without a reason.
