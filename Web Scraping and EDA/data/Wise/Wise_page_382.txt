But my experience with them over the last week has made me strongly consider changing to a different service provider. I've been trying to send money that my mother gifted me to my Wise account but they want me to send massive amounts of paperwork to verify this payment. Any paperwork that I have given them to try and verify this payment or my other sources of income has been denied even though they are from banks or tax authorities. Any attempt to resolve this with their customer service has been completely useless. The people working in their customer service department are easily the most incompetent I have dealt with in many years. It is clear that they don't actually read what your issue is. They just respond with standardized responses. Either they don't care to help or they are not trained enough to really resolve the issue. It can't take weeks of back and forth and heaps of proofs and paperwork every time I want to put money into my account. It's a real shame that Wise has become useless over the last while because apart from this, I've been really happy.
