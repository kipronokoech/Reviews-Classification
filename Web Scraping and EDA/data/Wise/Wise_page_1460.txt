To be honest, it probably was because I\'m not a real wizard on the Internet. However, this has happened to me before. What I wanted to do was transfer Hungarian forints from my local bank account to my Euros account ("jar") with TransferWise. What happened--and this is the second time that I have had the same problem--was that the Hungarian forints were sent to TW; then TW converted them to 200 euros; and instead of depositing the money into my "euros jar", TW sent the euros back to my bank. My bank in turn, reconverted the euros to forints and added a 2 euro surcharge (as well as I received a lower exchange conversion rate from them than what I had received from TW). In sum, it was a futile effort, a minor loss, but nevertheless, quite disconcerting. Like I have stated, I suspect that I am the one responsible for the error, and that I messed this up myself. However, all I really wanted to do was to "top-up" my euros jar. (It was further complicated by the fact that initially my bank would not transfer a larger sum because of limits that I had previously set with my bank.) I have had very good experiences with TW before, and I will continue to use your services. I do think your service is 5-star! The only suggestion that I would make is MORE CLARITY in the transfer instructions--to help computer "dinosaurs" like me, and perhaps, a few others.

Sadly, things went very wrong. Apparently, my Wise.com account was hacked and hackers managed to transfer the entire balance of my business account (Chase) via a series of unauthorized transfers. This happened overnight. Wise did not bother to alert me. Instead, they sent a cryptic message about having to close my account to keep my money safe! Ironic, right, since there was no more money in my Chase account? I've only learned about it after my Chase business debit card was declined, so, not from Wise. Their customer service hours in the U.S. is 10 am to 3 pm Eastern time. What a joke! A company moving people's money should have 24/7 functioning customer support. Even after I was able to speak to someone at Wise, they basically said there's not much they can do but they will talk to an appropriate department. Days have passed and I have not heard from them. No one has contacted me via email, as promised. They don't have any kind of internal reference number system to follow up, nothing. Thankfully, Chase has reversed the fraudulent transactions, albeit, conditionally, since the investigation is ongoing. Wise did absolutely nothing to a) address their awful security situation; b) alert the customer about the fraudulent transfers. Mind you, in order to debit money from the connected bank account, one must create new transfer recipients, which should have raised red flags with Wise.com. I can go on and on about how poor their security and customer service are. All in all, stay away from this company if you don't want to get your money stolen.", 'review_date': '2022-07-06', 'review_time': '19:50:33', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nJul 7, 2022\nHi there,\n\nWe completely understand your point of view, but we're continuously working on keeping those things happening on our platform.

With that said, we're glad you were able to sort this with your bank, as that's where the money was pulled, if understood correctly.\n\nMake sure to report this to your local authorities as well, and if the police should reach out to us, we'd be more than happy to cooperate with them.\n\nWise", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2022-07-07', 'CompanyReplyTime': '09:48:35'}
