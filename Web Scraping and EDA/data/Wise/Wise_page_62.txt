While we do that, you can always see an estimate of how long it’ll take to complete your transfer. Keep in mind this estimate can change depending on a few factors, such as the currencies you’re sending, when and how you are paying us. If we need more time, you’ll see the estimate update too.\n\nLearn more about that here: https://wi.se/howlongpaymentsbalance\n\nWise', 'CompanyReplyDate': '2023-10-24', 'CompanyReplyTime': '08:37:37'}

It's often a result of a conflict with our Terms of Service or Customer Agreement, or due to a discrepancy with a financial law. We can't always share the exact reason for the deactivation, due to how we're regulated.\n\nIf you've already made an appeal, following these guidelines: https://wi.se/accountdeactivation, then we're sure that our team will review your request and get back to you ASAP via email.\n\nWe'll work on sending the remaining money in your account back to you. But first, we need to carry out due diligence checks. While we do that, your money and information stays safe and secure.\n\nWise", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2023-10-02', 'CompanyReplyTime': '06:57:37'}
