When we close an account with money on it, we need to carry due diligence checks first. Once these checks are completed, we always get in touch about the refund.\n\nDue diligence checks are conducted to verify the information you have provided to us. We are required to do these at all stages of the customer relationship, not just during the initial onboarding stage, so this means during the customer relationship as well as during the deactivation stage.\n\nIf you've successfully appealed, then our team will reach out to you within 30 business days with an update, so hopefully you'll hear back rather soon.\n\nWise.", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2023-01-04', 'CompanyReplyTime': '14:08:56'}

I wouldn't mind if it wasn't for the fact that one of them was from my partner who has sent me probably 50+ transactions during the time I've had this account (so how is it suspicious?) and one was from MY OWN account authorised directly through the app. It seems wise randomly puts your account as high risk or something... The chances of both of these transactions being just held for random checks is obviously quite low. Ridiculous.
