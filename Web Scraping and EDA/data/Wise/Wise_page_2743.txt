It isn't possible to have it all at once via the app, but even from the app you can get to our FAQ articles.\n\nOn our guide to get verified, we explain we can accept documents in a few languages.

I complained nearly about two weeks ago and still have not received a refund. They are blaming me for not reading their FAQ when their purchasing flow made no indication whatsoever of limitations. All they needed to do was say “Receive payments in USD and EUR from abroad,” or whatever the currencies are. They also ask what currencies you want to open accounts for during this process, so again it would have been trivial for them to alert me that at least one of the currencies wasn’t supported. This is an important limitation that was mentioned nowhere during the purchasing process. This is lazy design and gaslighting support, including their response here.\n\nIt’s like buying washing machine that says “does your laundry” and being blamed by the manufacturer for not reading the manual when you complain it doesn’t wash polyester… even though you told their sales person this is what you needed.', 'review_date': '2021-10-13', 'review_time': '18:34:20', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nOct 13, 2021\nHello Chris,\n\nAll the currencies we support, and you're able to receive are shared with you on our website and on our FAQ articles as well.

Transferwise used to be excellent with fast (almost immediate) funds transfers from abroad and to accounts. Australia to UK in seconds.

Customer service can't provide an adequate response. I wish to do some fast transfers from UK to Euro accounts and will now have to wait days. It feels like Wise is now no different from all the other players in the market except for slightly better exchange rates. Their fees seem to have gone up also. Disapointing.

We're still the same company though and the rebranding didn't affect our speed.\n\nEUR transfers can take up to 2 working days to pay out, so setting up a transfer order on Friday, can lead to your payment being completed only by Monday.\n\nWise.", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2021-10-13', 'CompanyReplyTime': '12:28:59'}
