It is super convenient and reasonably priced; however, I have had one slight issue with the service. I have had several instances where I have initiated a transfer and before finalizing it, it will say that the transfer will only take a few hours. After completing the transfer, only a few moments later, I will receive a confirmation of the completion of the transfer and in that e-mail it will then tell me it will take several days to receive. It just seems very deceiving to tell someone a transfer will only take hours before and then immediately telling them it will take days once it goes through. I've noticed it seems to happen in close proximity to a weekend or holiday(which is understandable as I can't expect things to be accomplished immediately on non-work days). I just wish transferwise would be more forthright with how long their customers can expect to wait BEFORE they complete the transfer.", 'review_date': '2021-01-27', 'review_time': '13:09:50', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

{'platform': 'Wise', 'id': '601155d7679d9701d07a02ad', 'stars': 2, 'title': 'Now suitable only for individuals and small businesses', 'message': 'Recent introduction of 0.4% fee for sums above 70k EUR undermines our business processes with TransferWise. It means we cannot receive big payments, cannot arrange bulk payouts without being charged extra for money coming and going through our account. Unfortunately, now we have to cut our activity with TW to minor occasional transactions.\n\nProbably TransferWise is going to focus on private individuals and small businesses from now on. And it\'s sad, because they were nice in most of other terms.\n\nAnother annoying thing is that they constantly try to cheat you into transactions with higher fees. Eg. when making a 0.28 EUR worth SEPA transfer in EU, the default payment option is always a debit card transfer that costs 23.40 EUR - almost a hundred times more expensive! - or a transfer from another bank, or another option when available - but always the more expensive. Guys this behavior doesn\'t build up trust!\n\nBulk payments via another bank do not work on accounting side, because they are not reflected in account statements. Eg. you create a bulk payment to 50 recipients, Wise gives you a single IBAN for whole batch, you send total from your main bank to this account and... this transfer is nowhere to find in Wise statements. While in your bank you\'ll have only that 1 transfer with no details. It\'s unusable feature if you do even basic accounting.\n\nOffering the "best currency exchange rates" but then charging a conversion fee is confusing and makes you feel you\'re being cheated again. Why not to add this fee into your exchange rate and stop making an image that you\'re doing something unusual?\n\nFinally, since they charge a percentage for SWIFT transfers, this is only beneficial on small amounts up to 2-3k EUR. Above that your ordinary bank with fixed transfer fees will be cheaper.', 'review_date': '2021-12-08', 'review_time': '15:41:26', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nFeb 3, 2021\nThanks for sharing your feedback with us, Vlad.\n\nRest assured our goal is not to drive your business away - or even stop offering our services to bigger business in general. However, we had to introduce this fee because interest rates are negative in the Eurozone. This means that it costs us money to hold EUR for our customers. We explain everything here: https://bit.ly/3oKpaSK.\n\nWe're working towards a free to use product, but we haven't reached this goal just yet. Until then, we'll always disclose our fees and we keep our pricing as transparent as possible.\n\nAll the best,\nTransferWise", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2021-02-03', 'CompanyReplyTime': '11:57:48'}
