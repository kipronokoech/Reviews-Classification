Your recipient can try looking for a transaction on their bank statement from Wise — they might not see your name. The transfer might also come from one of our partners, but the amount and reference should still help find the payout.\n- The recipient’s bank details.

Your recipient’s account may be in a currency that’s different to the one you’ve sent them. If that’s the case, they could get a different amount from us because their bank might have converted the money.\n\nYou can also share with them a transfer receipt: https://wi.se/getpdfreceipt.
