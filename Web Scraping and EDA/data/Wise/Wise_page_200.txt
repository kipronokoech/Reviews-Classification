We’re a regulated financial institution, so we should know who’s using our service, why they're using it, and that their money comes from a legitimate place. This helps us keep your money and our platform safe. So depending on where you’re sending money from, and how much you send, we might need to ask you to upload some documents for verification.\n\nUsually, if we can't accept a document, we email you to tell you the reason, and inform you about alternative documents. That should be the reason why you're getting contacts from us.\n\nPlease know, asking for documents for verification doesn't necessarily mean that there's something wrong in your account. Every customer needs to get verified at some point while using Wise.\n\nWe hope this clarifies, but please get in touch with us at https://wi.se/contactus or on our social media channels. Our support team will be happy to answer your questions.\n\nThank you for your feedback.\n\nWise", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2023-08-04', 'CompanyReplyTime': '09:25:21'}

We ever only close accounts that are being used in a way that goes against our Terms of Use: https://wi.se/customeragreement\n\nWhen we close an account, all pending transfers are returned to the originating accounts. So, if the transfers were yet to be completed by the time of deactivation, they should have returned to the sender(s).\n\nAs for your remaining money in your account, we'll work on sending it back to you. But first, we need to carry out due diligence checks. While we do that, your money and information will be safe and secure.\n\nPlease also note that we're a regulated financial institution, and we follow a strict series of rules in every country we operate in: https://wi.se/regulation Scamming is definitely not what we're doing here.\n\nWe're sorry to hear that your experience with our support wasn't ideal. Our customers truly only deserve the best. Please know, customer support agents can't see why an account was closed, and they have restricted access to deactivated accounts.
