Our ability to pay salaries, serve clients, has been halted by deliberate (and negligent - as noted in one of their emails) action on the part of Wise PLC. If you think Paypal is notorious for random, meritless account freezes, wait until you entrust your business to Wise. We\'re a mid-sized business offering old vinyl records, books, etc. This wasn\'t a security issue - but merely - a \'random\' account verification process - on an account that has already been verified for many years.\n\nIn short - your money is at no point safe with WISE. Regardless of the nature of your business, at any point Wise can and eventually likely will - freeze your assets - possibly for weeks or months (as an increasing number of clients here will attest to). This company was once fantastic, we invested in them heavily (both privately and via our business).\n\nHowever, at the end of the day - a financial institution\'s future is only as strong as the confidence it\'s client\'s have in how safe the funds they entrust to that company are. That confidence is no longer in place.\n\nIt\'s odd - a company that continues to boast about the increasing speed with which it can transfer funds for clients, when in practice, the only thing that is apparently gaining in momentum and speed - is the amount of customer funds they are freezing. See the most recent reviews below - and, also take note, of the number of positive reviews left by new accounts.\n\nNote to Wise: instead of insulting us (and the intelligence of readers) further, by presenting a canned response to this review below like "we can\'t find your account" or "please reach out to us and we\'ll assist", we have reached out to you - several times regarding this matter. Your staff remain incompetent, rising to the level of negligence (making requests, that end up being \'incorrect\' (later confirmed in writing by your staff) further delaying resolution). Documentation requested to compliance matters was submitted - and verified - over a week ago, yet - two weeks into the affair - account remains frozen, our business is taking notable financial losses, and your staff fails to respond to any message).\n\nI\'d say, referring to your entity as "Wise" is probably one of the greatest ironies of all, considering our decision to move our business to Wise was probably the single most \'unwise\' business decision we\'ve made.', 'review_date': '2023-05-15', 'review_time': '11:16:44', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nMay 30, 2023\nHi there,\n\nWe appreciate you taking the time to share your concerns with us.
