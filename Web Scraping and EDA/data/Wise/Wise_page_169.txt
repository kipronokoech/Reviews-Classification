For certain updates, like your name, we require a legal document showing the name change to ensure everything is legit and secure. The verification process for this might take from a few hours to 2-4 working days. But don't worry, we're working hard to speed things up and make it more seamless for you. You can find more detailed info about this here: https://wi.se/edit-details\n\nWe've also taken a closer look at your case, and rest assured, our team is already on it, working their magic to sort things out for you.

On June 24th, I transferred £500 from my UK bank account to my Wise account to send money to Turkey. However, it has been 28 days, and Wise still hasn't released my funds, saying they're still verifying my account.\n\nDespite reaching out to customer service and sending emails multiple times, I haven't received a helpful response, only being told to wait without a specific timeframe. This lack of concern and responsiveness is causing me significant distress and inconvenience.\n\nI want to highlight that Wise's actions may breach standard business practices and could have legal consequences. Initially, they mentioned the verification process might take 2-10 business days, with the possibility of some extensions. However, it's now an unacceptable 20 business days, and they've informed me that I'll receive a response after an additional 35 calendar days from today, meaning in September.\n\nThis delay and lack of transparency are unacceptable, making me doubt the reliability of Wise's services. I want to emphasize that I take this matter very seriously and I'm prepared to take necessary actions to protect my rights.\n\nI have already filed a complaint and shared my negative experience with Wise in the Turkish Customer Complaint Platform, one of country Wise operates. I've also consulted with a legal expert specializing in technology law, and if this matter remains unresolved, I may take legal action against Wise in international courts.\n\nI urge Wise to treat this issue seriously and resolve it promptly. It's crucial that my funds, totaling £500, are returned immediately, and an official response is provided without further delay.\n\nPlease consider this email as my final warning before taking escalated actions to protect my rights and seek legal remedies. I expect Wise to address this matter promptly and professionally.\n\nI look forward to receiving a satisfactory resolution to this matter within a few days. If this doesn't happen, I'll have no choice but to take further actions to seek justice.\n\nPlease acknowledge this message and provide a written response to this complaint as soon as possible.\n\nSincerely", 'review_date': '2023-07-22', 'review_time': '11:19:00', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

However, if you are travelling and want a real bank account and card that you can trust to work internationally and in cash machines - don't choose Wise.

If you don't have international telephone calls on you phone package because you use Apps for international conversations - don't choose Wise.\nIn our latest issue with our Wise accounts. My teenage daughter has had payments into her account blocked until she can re-verify the account. She is travelling in China and has no access to the documents requested. She has £17 left in her account. Wise won’t talk (or listen) to me because they can only talk to the account holder. They won’t even talk you through a generic situation so I can advise my daughter. My daughter emailed Wise 24hrs ago but has had no response. The website says standard response times is ‘two days’ no good in an emergency or when you have bills to pay!! She can’t easily talk to Wise via the chat bot because it only works during UK office hours!! It’s ironic that travelling in China has been very easy and exceeded all our expectations, while her western ‘travel friendly’ bank account is useless. My daughter has been left high and dry, while we try to find a way to get her some funds. If you want to have reliable access to your money – don’t choose Wise.\nThis is really stressful and has cast a black cloud over what should have been a wonderful experience.\n\nUPDATE: We now find that Wise don't work on weekends so no-one is available to help unblock my daughter's account for three days given the time difference.

In there, you'll find that during the period that your account remains open, some features like receiving payments and requesting money are no longer available. However, you can still do other stuff, like spending with your Wise card, sending money from your Wise balance, and converting between balances.\n\nThis means that if someone has sent you money, the transfer will be cancelled, and refunded to the sender.\n\nRemember, we're always here to help!
