Many many transfers from a few hundred $ to tens of thousands $, a Wise card for a few years too. Today, I closed my account. Wise decided to ruin our 50,000€ transfer. We followed the same instructions, as we always do, but this time Wise decided to block our transfer and ask for documents. We provided the documents, they asked for the same documents again and again. Their customer service is so incompetent that you are under the impression to speak with a very limited robot. They don't understand anything and they keep repeating the same stuff. They cannot understand that banks are providing monthly statements, so obviously a 3-days-old transaction doesn't show on the last statement. Customer service on the phone is useless, they just agree with you and confirm that everything looks good, but they have no power to do anything. The employees in the back are unreachable. And then they suddenly decided to cancel the transfer without any explanation, our 50K€ that they are holding for a whole week isn't going anywhere. No one is able to explain why.

Initially everything seemed great. Especially the access to a British account from abroad was very useful for my move to the UK. However, after a month they withheld salaries without providing any legitimate reason for an excessive amount of time. The customer service did not help until I threatened legal consequences and started the formal complaint process to get the financial ombudsman involved. According to Wise these were 'checks' they have to run as a 'regulated financial institution'. However, they seem to be unwilling or unable to provide any legal basis that justifies withholding customers money - despite repeated, direct questions. The only answer I received in this regard was that these are 'routine regulatory checks'. I finally received my money 3 weeks (instead of 2-10 days as Wise claims for their 'checks').\nIn short, unless you can live without access to the money in your Wise account for several weeks you should not use their services longer than necessary.
