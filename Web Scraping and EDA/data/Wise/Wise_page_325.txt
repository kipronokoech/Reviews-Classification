Any issues are dealt with directly via email correspondence in my instance, and they keep you informed. The recent cash back feature was an unexpected bonus and soon adds up each month. The Wise team suggest new products that generate profit for existing customers, like switching to the more than 3.8% interest account (forgotten the exact figure). I did this just this week in just 60 seconds and now I’m earning interest whilst still having effectively the same access to my cash. It’s on business or personal accounts too.

This said, we take your feedback seriously and appreciate you bringing these concerns to our attention.\n\nAt Wise, we work hard to provide a reliable and transparent service to our customers.

These checks are essential to ensure compliance with relevant regulations and to keep Wise safe for everyone.\n\nRegarding the issue of funds being confiscated, we would like to clarify that we'd never hold your money without a reason.\n\nPlease know that we also investigate every complaint thoroughly and aim to resolve any issues in a fair and timely manner. If you have filed a complaint with the ombudsman, rest assured that we'll cooperate fully and address the matter accordingly.\n\nWe'd like to take a closer look at your case, so please reach out to us here: https://wi.se/contactus_ or on Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram with your email or user number.
