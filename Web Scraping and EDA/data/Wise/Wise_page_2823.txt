The service has reached an all time low. I recently was sent money by two clients (who have been sending money to same business account regularly for similar amounts for months.) They accepted money into the system and did not credit to my account. I only found out when I called to check, they did not advise. They told me that it would be a day or two to check. I advised i needed money to live and wanted to transfer some to personal account from my balance. Was told should be fine, I tried to transfer some and it got ‚Äúfrozen‚Äù too. I then called again and they advised to send from another bank account to personal to use. I did this and it got frozen too‚Ä¶.Over course of four days I have been lied to and given the most appaluing service. They now have all my business and personal accounts ‚Äúunder checks‚Äù, and i have no access to any money.
