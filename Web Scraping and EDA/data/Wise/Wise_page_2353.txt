Since they have changed to WISE, I have become a very disappointed customer. I transferred money on 3 Dec, a transaction that used to be very quick, mostly the transfer was completed in seconds took nearly 4 days. I promised my self to fully monitor the next transfer. I was quoted next day transfer when I set up the transfer. After transferring the money, the " next day transfer" changed to 2 days. I rang their call centre. Yes, they confirmed, it will take 2 days. I said that I was very disappointed at this deceit. No apology was forthcoming from the agent. I cancelled the transfer, God knows how long it will take to get my refund, but I refuse to deal with a deceitful company like WISE anymore.

We now find that it takes roughly 6 seconds to receive the money in our French bank account after they receive it from our English one. This is quite amazing! The exchange rate is always spot-on with the published one and roughly £6 to transfer 2,000€ is very reasonable. One thing we find confusing is just what to choose when we are trying to send the Sterling from our British bank. There are several options and one goes direct to the bank and we prefer to already be looking at our British bank online. This is a minor point, but it trips us up every time. We also prefer the old name as "Wise" is a bit lacking and if recommending the service to others they never understand what "Wise" refers to.', 'review_date': '2022-01-05', 'review_time': '11:44:04', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
