I had to pay from another account manually to Paypal and others but the money on the WISE account is still gone.\nI tried to contact WISE since 5 days:\n- Wise customer service is not available anymore since several days.\n- Wise chat function is not replying since 5 days.\n- Wise phone support is not available since several days.\n\nI have not received any reply from WISE.\n\nReading the terms and conditions and especially the "safeguarding" of customer money (translated on the German website) states that there are several possibilities to loose the money on a Wise account.\nWISE is stating on their website that they are securing the money according to FCA requirements.\n\nWISE is writing that they are securing the money into approved banks (such as JPMorgan, RBS, Barcalys, Ayden, Citibank) but only for UK-residents. (see screenshot)The "Safeguarding" at Wise means that some part of the money of UK-residents is secured into an account of banks in Europe. WISE is also stating that they can change to any any other assets as they want, dependent on their willingness to take risks.\nQuestion to Wise:\n1) Why the German website only describes how the money from UK residents is secured? What security do I have as a German resident?\n2) What security do I have if you can change the asset as described on the website? (see screenshot)\n3) As the stock was growing for years and the interest was negative in the last years the probability that WISE put a lot of customer money into risky investments is very high. Right or wrong assumption?\n4) What does the following statement means?\n"The bank will not check if the money secured into the account is equivalent to the amount paid of the customers into their individual account. This responsibility to check the right amount is lonely with WISE as e-Bank.
