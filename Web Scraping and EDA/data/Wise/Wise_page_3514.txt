Check out our guide for USD transfers here:https://transferwise.com/help/articles/2932150, where we also explain which details we'd need.\n\nIf you're planning to send USD outside USA, we can help as well- but bear in mind that it would be SWIFT transfer in this case. This means additional fees from the banks who move your funds. Read more about that here:https://transferwise.com/help/articles/2553074.\n\nIf you'd like to find SWIFT codes, we do have a dedicated page for that here-https://transferwise.com/gb/swift-codes/banks.\n\nIf you'd like some help, don't hesitate to reach out to us and we'll assist.
