The Help Centre could not "help" at all and told me they had no details for the department that deals with the deactivation of accounts. I contacted them on 4 occasions and kept getting no help and no release of my funds. This is a dishonest practice and while I understand the need to check customers out, they should not have the right to hold onto money that is not theirs.
