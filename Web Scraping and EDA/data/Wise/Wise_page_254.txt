Few transactions of mine have been unnecessarily paused for longer periods despite the fact that i have already submitted all the required docs. A photo Id, an employment letter and a proof of income. The most awful one was when i travelled with my family to USA , my USD account top up was blocked, i was stuck abroad unable to use my card on any spendings for the first day of the trip until i had to make an international call to the customer service insisting that they have no reason to block the transaction because my verification docs are already submitted and approved. The customer service response was super careless when they said problem will be solved in 2 business days , they had no sense of urgency at all since i was already abroad with my family and obviously i can not tolerate this inability to spend for two more days. They escalated the issue only when i insisted that they must do so.', 'review_date': '2023-06-11', 'review_time': '06:53:44', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nJun 12, 2023\nHi Sherif,\n\nWe appreciate you taking the time to share your feedback with us.
