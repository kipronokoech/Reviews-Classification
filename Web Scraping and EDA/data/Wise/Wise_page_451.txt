In December, I opened a business account with them for the first time in order to receive payments from international customers. The account operated smoothly until February, when it was suddenly shut down because my "business was dissolved." That was news to me! After proving to them that my business was still active by sending them a link to the state business registry where my business is listed, Wise said my account was ready to use. But when a customer tried to send a payment, it was denied, and my customer was told the account no longer existed. I made other payment arrangements with the customer, but now Wise\'s mistake was causing headaches not only for me but also my customer. I have since spent hours trying to resolve the situation through email with Wise customer service, and it honestly feels like I am talking to a bunch of gum-smacking middle school students. They cannot seem to read (or comprehend) the chain of emails explaining the situation, and they are insisting that I had a business called "(My Name) & Co." that was dissolved. I never had a business with that name, and I never had a business that was dissolved. The whole situation is ludicrous. Needless to say, I won\'t be using Wise again for my business, and I am also looking into alternate ways to transfer my personal funds.
