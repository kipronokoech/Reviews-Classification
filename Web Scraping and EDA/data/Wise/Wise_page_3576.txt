{'platform': 'Wise', 'id': '5ffacaad755dc1032c11508e', 'stars': 1, 'title': 'Transferwise (or not very wise)', 'message': "Transferwise (or not very wise)\n\nMy wife is in France and I am in UK. Last April my wife was robbed in a Paris railway station and lost her Transferwise Debit card (amoung other things), instead of freezing her account Transferwise closed it. Since then we have been trying to open a new account but Transferwise are so difficult to deal with and even though I sent them a copy of the Power of Attorney that I hold for my wife, they would not discuss tha application with me. I pointed out to them that this was against the law but got no response. Eventually last December they sent me in UK a new Debit card for a new account for my wife. I took the card to an ATM and changed the PIN, then withdrew ¬£5 to make sure the card worked. I had previously put ¬£20 on the card. The following morning the account was DEACTIVATED for no reason. It can't be for money laundering Rules as the amount is too small, and I doubt if anyone else could have tried to access the account 24 hours after it was opened. Transferwise said my wife must appeal!! She did this 9 days ago and we are still waiting for an answer. I would also like to say that they charged ¬£6.00 for the Debit card which I think is outrageous.\nI have had my Metro Bank debit card frozen twice due to the fact that I used a new iPhone to access my account which their computer sees as UNUSUAL Activity, which is fair enough because on speaking to the bank they asked if it was me and to verify my iPhone which I did and they reopened the account immediately. If Metro Bank can do this why can't Transferwise. I suspect this is why they froze the account because they only allow one phone or computer to be linked to an account but with the new account I had only used my phone so that should not have been a problem.", 'review_date': '2021-01-10', 'review_time': '09:54:19', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nJan 13, 2021\nHi David,\n\nThanks for taking the time to share this experience with us, and we're very sorry to hear how it played out. It's never our intention to make things more difficult for any of our customers.\n\nWhen a debit card is stolen and a customer gets in touch, we always advise to freeze the card or we can freeze it for them. We're assuming your wife's account was deactivated as a whole because her phone might have been stolen too and she had the app on there.\n\nAbout the second deactivation, our Appeals team replies within 10 working days if an appeal is submitted. If your wife still hasn't hear back yet please have her contact us directly here: https://wi.se/contactus_. We'll take a closer look and help her with the next steps,\n\nThanks,\nThe TransferWise Team", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2021-01-13', 'CompanyReplyTime': '16:23:37'}
