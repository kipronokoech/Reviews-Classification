I've had my transferwise account for 2 years but recently activated it because of the need to make payment abroad to family and pay for services and suddenly my account got deactivated and my 713gbp is held and can't be refunded until after 60 working days.. like who does that? Why 60 days... ¬ø? You just can't seize someone's money because they use your service..... Really it's frustrating.. wat diligence check gives you to right to block an account and seize people's money for 3 months without any proper investigation. it's really frustrating and I'm never going to use this service.

If the recipient bank received the payment with the wrong info then they would send it back. If you paid for a transfer from an account with the wrong name on it then we wouldn't be able to process that payment as the info must match your account's.\n\nOur support team should be noting the info for any contact, so hopefully the issue was clarified. If not feel free to reach out and ask for clarification. You can also request to speak with an agent you know is familiar with the case to avoid any confusion. Hopefully the issue has been resolved.
