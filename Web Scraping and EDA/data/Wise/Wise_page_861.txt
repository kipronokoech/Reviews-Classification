I used Wise to transfer money from the US to Canada to return my debt to my friend. Initially Wise gave me an estimated time of transfer in a few days and after they kept my money for almost two weeks without any reason, I reached out to them asking why it took that long for my money to be transferred, they come up with a very funny reason that due to my nationality they suspect this money may go to support terrorism. a clear bias and discrimination. I was shocked when I heard it and I explained that this is just to return my friends money. Then, they asked me to send them more documents proving that I am returing the debt. I send them the reciept for the money I got from same person few month ago and any other document they wanted. Finally, they said they are not satisfied and they will either withdraw the transaction or block my money and even don't return it to me. Only once I told them I am gonna sue you for this if you won't return my money right away and block it, they send me an email and force me to accept their rules to at least get my money back. Totally weird, unreliable, and a garbage company. I will never suggest them to anyone. Finally, after almost three weeks of holding my money, they return it to me without any apology.", 'review_date': '2022-10-27', 'review_time': '06:14:01', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nUpdated Oct 27, 2022\nHello, Sasan\n\nPlease mind that any regulated financial institution has the right to carry out compliance related checks in order to confirm who is sending/receiving money and why.
