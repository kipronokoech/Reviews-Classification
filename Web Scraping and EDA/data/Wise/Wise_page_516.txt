This is a routine procedure to help us ensure we‚Äôre keeping our platform safe for everyone using (including you) while complying with local regulations.\n\nAs processing these checks is a legal requirement and therefore cannot be avoided, we have the following section in our Customer Agreement agreed by you upon opening of your Wise account: https://wise.com/terms-of-use\n\n‚ÄúVerification checks may increase the time for processing your transfer order. We carry out verification checks, and these checks may increase the time it takes to process your transfer order. We cannot be responsible for any delays as a result of carrying out those checks.‚Äù\n\nSpeed is always our priority, but so is diligence. Depending on the case, it can take from hours to several days. Do keep in mind, we always make sure to update you along the way, and you‚Äôll know the status of your transfer at all times.\n\n\nWise', 'CompanyReplyDate': '2023-01-24', 'CompanyReplyTime': '11:10:35'}

I was asked for a large amount of paperwork which is pretty standard practice. But after 3 weeks of hearing nothing and not receiving any emails back. I had to call in 3 times and each time the agent told me they were communicating with the accounts team to ensure they weren't confused about any of the information they were reviewing. After submitting all the documentation required that validated my business, identification, and transactions, my account was deactivated without citing why. This is absolutely one of the worse customer experiences I have ever had with anyone I've ever worked with and I've worked with many financial institutions. Wise should frankly be embarrassed to have such an incompetent staff. I cannot recommend this platform to anyone. It's truly shocking how unprofessional they are. If I could give them 0 stars I would.\n\nUpdate 1/31/2023: I got word from Trustpilot that Wise tried to have my review taken down so of course I provided screenshots proving everything that happened. Additionally, I have provided 3 months of bank statements from my other business confirming the source of income. I have even sent in over 10 invoices from my clients proving this as well. Yet, Wise is demanding I provide personal bank statements to prove the source of funds for my new business even though I do NOT fund my business with my personal account at all. This is an absurd invasion of privacy and makes me believe that the account handlers at Wise are biased in who they approve an account for. I reluctantly agreed because there was nothing more I could do. At this point I have sent them over 30 articles of documentation and my account is still banned. I cannot say this enough, I would give them 0 stars or a negative rating if I could. Wise has no regard for their customers whatsoever.", 'review_date': '2023-01-31', 'review_time': '22:41:34', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
