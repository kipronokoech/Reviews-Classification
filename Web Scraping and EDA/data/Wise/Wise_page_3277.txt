Raping the human race of their riches and Sovereignty.\nIt has now been over 1 MONTH since Wise Fraudulently shut down my account with absolutely NO REASON. Withholding MY MONEY (fiat currency) When i contacted Wise they said they didn't need to provide i with an explanation, and yet it is MY MONEY (fiat currency)\nAnd it was more like $14k + nearly $5k in undelivered payments. FINALLY, after 1 MONTH, i received a refund of $4480. Though i am still waiting for the $EUR9,200.00 to be returned to i.\n\nWise i WILL be taking action against you (claims for damages) for what you have done to me, the major loss of income i have experienced from you withholding my money, and all of the late fees/penalties i have been given as you have stolen my money for absolutely no truthful reason. Wise and all its directors and owners will compensate me for my damages and losses.", 'review_date': '2021-05-05', 'review_time': '01:11:43', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nMay 5, 2021\nHello Jamie.\n\nWe completely understand you're upset, but this is far away from the truth.\n\nAccount deactivation isn't something we take lightly. It's normally a result of a conflict with our Terms of Service or Customer Agreement, or due to a discrepancy with a financial law.\n\nWhen we deactivate your account, we cancel all pending payments. We’ll work on returning any money that you’ve already sent the way we received it.\n\nWe know this can be very frustrating, but we're not being deliberately difficult — it's just the way the law works.\n\nTo know more about what to do if your account was deactivated and appeal our decision check here: https://wi.se/accountdeactivation_\n\nRegards,\nWise Team", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2021-05-05', 'CompanyReplyTime': '13:27:47'}
