The bank did warn that it cannot check the name of the recipient for this account, which is fair enough. Perhaps Wise delayed the transfer for the same reason, but there is a big difference between giving a warning as the bank did and delaying the transfer.\n\nThe conclusion from this is that banks tend to treat you like an adult and you can expect a normal level of reliability from them. Wise, on the other hand, will claim that their substandard level of service is because they are regulated by authorities (even though all actual banks are, and it is not a valid excuse), treat you like a kid or a criminal suspect, and you can potentially incur substantial damages because Wise will often delay your transaction after it was already sent (as it happened in this case).
