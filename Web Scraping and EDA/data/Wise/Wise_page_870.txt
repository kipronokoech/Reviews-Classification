Some of them are slower and some faster. The moment you instate it from your bank it's starts processing it—how fast they do it's out of our control. As soon as the money reaches us, we'll give our best to move it as quickly as possible. In fact, our mission is to make it instant.\nHowever, there are few things it depends on, you can read about it here: https://wi.se/howlongdoesatransfertakes\n\nWe follow a strict set of rules set by regulatory agencies in every country we operate in — like the FCA in the UK. These agencies protect you, and protect the market we operate in. Find out how we’re regulated in your country here: https://wi.se/regulation-\n\nWise isn’t covered by the FSCS because the scheme doesn’t cover payment service firms, as we are not a bank, and don’t lend out customer funds. However, we still have to prove to the FCA that customers’ money is safe, which we do through safeguarding. This means that, by law, we have to keep all of your money in accounts that are completely separate from the ones we use to run our business. So, your money is backed by assets that we hold in separate accounts. These funds are called ‘safeguarded funds’.
