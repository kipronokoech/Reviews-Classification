Had a dispute open for multiple weeks and there is still no progress on it. They continuously keep asking me for the same documents that I've already sent the multiple times.\n\n2. You cannot reply to their support emails without a ghetto workaround which requires you to delete all previous chat history when making a reply because their spam filters seem to block any Microsoft domain replies. This was reported about a month and a half ago and there's still no movement on resolving this. They continue to blame Microsoft instead of acknowledging that the spam filters are set by themselves. This is likely something they just tell customers to not have the blame fall on themselves.\n\n3. Finally, I can no longer add cards to my Google Pay on my phone. I continuously keep getting a network error when trying to add the card through the Wise app and if I try adding it manually through Google Pay, I get an error saying to contact my bank for more information. This is another thing that I have brought to their attention, but they refuse to do anything about it because they don't seem to understand how their own systems work. I spoke with Google about this on multiple occasions and they said that there is a token issue on the banks end & that would need to be resolved. I've sent the my chat transcripts with Google directly to Wise, yet they still refuse to do anything to resolve the issue.\n\nWhen speaking with Google they had stated that each device that has Google Pay is limited to how many tokens can be used on that specific device. This limit is set by the bank themselves. I was told to contact my bank and explain to them that they need to reset the token distribution for my device and then I would be able to add the card again. Wise doesn't seem to understand what I'm talking about and continues to provide me no support with this. They simply direct me to their FAQ and ask me to use another device if my main one doesn't work.\n\nYes they want me to throw away my main phone and use another phone or carry two phones at a time.\n\nHow feasible. Thanks Wise üëç", 'review_date': '2023-06-15', 'review_time': '02:47:51', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
