It worked great at first, but now every transaction gets declined if contactless, or chip. So if you like the excitement of getting your card declined, this one is for you. Better have a different card that works when you buy stuff. Great idea, but its simply does not work.\n\n06/27/2023\n\nI did indeed get a response from customer service, one that does not solve the problem or give me any alternatives that will make my Wise card experience any more useful.\n\nAs I explained in my reply to customer service, a feature in your app to accomplish the same thing would be the way I would handle this if I were you, instead of bricking the card.\n\nI don't know whether you travel much, but my experience is that most establishments are contactless or chip. I've asked to use my pin, as you directed, but they insist that that is unnecessary and not possible if it werent.\n\nSo you have every right to ask for a PIN, shut off my card, or do anything else you wish. This is exactly what you have done. The Wise card feature that declines transactions is working perfectly in my case.\n\nBut don't put yourself out by, say, offering to fix the problem for me so I can use my card. Don't worry that I might be stuck somewhere washing dishes because my meal transaction was declined. These are not your problems.\n\nFortunately, I brought another card. You know what they do? It just puts through contactless transactions whenever I need it to.\n\nI suggest that maybe you'd like to copy that feature. While I appreciate your diligence against fraud - creating the worlds most secure credit card because you decline every transaction attempted - is not the sort of marketing genius I would try if I were competing in the world of commerce.\n\nIn the meantime I'm Wise-less, unable to use the product that I presumed you wanted to be useful.\n\nMaybe if you fix this problem of yours, I'll try again next trip I take. To be sure, I'll have a card that I can rely upon to back me up.\n\nThank you for caring about me.\n\nDS", 'review_date': '2023-06-28', 'review_time': '14:37:36', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nJun 28, 2023\nHey there,\n\nThank you for your review.

In March of 2023 I was asked to provide detailed verification. I sent them bank statements, property sale deeds, contracting invoices everything. They then accepted multiple transfers and held the funds since then. When I needed to recently (June 2023) access my funds and do a transfer urgently I was asked to reverify everything. Nothing had changed, the money had been with Wise the entire time, but at transfer time, I was asked to reverify. The request wasn\'t pro-active; I wasn\'t contacted beforehand, only suddenly at the time of transfer it was necessary to provide everything again - this is in the space of less than 4 months. The money has been with Wise the whole time with no additions. I attempted to reverify and sent confirmation of my bank statement. This is a bank account which as been linked to Wise for years and I have in the past done transfers from. Nope, cannot verify as the transaction statement doesn\'t have my name on it. Wise already knows the account belongs to me - they have received and confirmed the same statements in the past. But no, cannot accept now. I sent them an actual bank statement with my name and full account number on it. Nope, too old. So, even though the statement matches the account number on the transaction statement and simply confirms my name, nope, not good enough. Like I said, it\'s not like they contacted me and asked for the details proactively; no, their process is to wait until you need to make a transfer. This is some of the worst customer service I have ever seen. The woman on the phone was utterly unhelpful and simply told me that I have to provided it again because "rules". No amount of reasoning with her that they already had the same information and statements on file registered with her.', 'review_date': '2023-06-27', 'review_time': '17:26:11', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
