Please make sure to send us over the proof of payment document: https://wi.se/whatisaproofofpayment_, so our team could track the money within our system. Your bank should be able to give you one, but they also could track the money from their side, and double-check if the money was sent to 100% correct details. Because if everything was set up correctly, then we would've received the money by now.\n\nWith that said, we'll make sure to investigate this further and help you in any way we possibly can. You can give us a call as well: https://wi.se/contactus_ for the latest update.\n\nWise.", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2022-10-25', 'CompanyReplyTime': '10:16:01'}

We can assure you that as a company, our goal is “mission zero” meaning we want to be fee free or low cost in as many currencies as possible. We’re always looking for ways to lower our fees, but we want to get there in a sustainable way, so each change will take some time.
