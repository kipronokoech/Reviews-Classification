But: Prices for my currency pairs went up more than once, there is in fact no big difference anymore to the established banks.\nAdditionally, the reliability of payment services decreased. I keep getting transfers back to my account and have to release them again (without any changes). Client service responds with the same stereotype (we are sorry that you...and we do our best to...) but in fact nothing changes. The next transfer to the same beneficiary again disappears and it takes weeks to reach... or it does get returned to my account again...\nDear Transferwise Team, please work on that, you already confirmed in the past that you can do better! Many thanks\n\nUpdate Dec 14\nDear TransferWise Team\nThanks for your reply. I have been in the banking field for many years and I know the spreads. So yes, the price difference to the official banks (at least for my currency pairs) has decreased so that there is almost no competitive advantage anymore.\n\nAdditionally, I was informed today that my transfer has again been returned to my account without any explanation. My request for support sent on Dec 9 is still unanswered. I sent a new one today... That is what I mean with "the reliability of payment services decreased". I know that you can do better because it has been better before.\nI hope my honest and sincere feedback will help you to improve your services.\nBest regards, a formerly happy client', 'review_date': '2020-12-14', 'review_time': '22:31:45', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nDec 14, 2020\nHi, Peter,\n\nThanks for the review, we highly appreciate it.\n\nAs part of our regular pricing reviews, we‚Äôre changing our prices to reflect the true cost of your transfer. Since March, the FX market has been more volatile, meaning that certain currencies have become more expensive to buy and convert. However, in other routes where we‚Äôre growing more sustainably, we‚Äôre able to reduce our costs, and make your transfer cheaper. Hopefully, you'll be happier with fees in the future.\n\nAlso, we always use live mid-market rates, but banks mostly don't. It means that they might hide extra charges in the exchange. So, please be careful with it.\n\nAs for transfers: rest assured that we always aim to proceed as quickly as possible. Some routes are even instant with us. But we'll keep working on improvements to make sure everything is running smoothly. Your feedback is valuable for us.\n\nAll the best wishes,\nThe TransferWise team.", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2020-12-14', 'CompanyReplyTime': '12:59:17'}

But first, we need to carry out due diligence checks. While we do that, your money and information will be safe and secure. These checks might take around 60 working days, but sometimes up to 90.\n\nPlease keep an eye on your inbox.
