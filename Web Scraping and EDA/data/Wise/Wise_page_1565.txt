No problem at all, I don't need the account, so i can just submit a refund request for the thousands of pounds in the account it says, only thing is, when i go to do so it states that all funds have been returned to originating bank account and I can't do anything more.\n\nWell, the issue with this is, the funds were a mixture of many many things including salary, and not 1, none of the individuals who have ever sent me any payments, including myself from my own accounts, have received anything back whatsoever.\n\nWise deactivated my account with ZERO notice, even now a week or so on, not even so much as an email, and whilst I am absolutely certain many who are on here stating the same, likely have done something wrong, i've done nothing.\n\nIts extremely apparent how they also waited until just 3 hours after I had personally transferred in £5k to myself, from my own savings, and then, and only then did they lock my account.\n\nI'll make this very clear now prior to their response, as im sure they will like with others claim to have contacted me. I've had the sum total of:\n\n0 Emails\n0 Calls\n\nNothing.... It's fortunate im not desperate for the funds paid in, but it's very clear that these lot are out to fleece people which is a shame as their app/service was the best i'd used to date.\n\nI would say i'll follow up once resolved but with Wise not contacting me in anyway, I guess i'll have to just submit a claim in the small claims court for the balance.\n\nAt least that way, someone from Wise will need to deal with it, or attend the hearing, had enough of this and I will be doing as i've said, I doubt very much given the lack of contact i've any hope of seeing my funds, so ill submit the papers.\n\nA report will be sent to the Financial Ombudsmen Service, aswell as the AMF (Canada) at the same time as the court papers being submitted. If TransferWise think i've done something wrong, i've no issue speaking to them, the fact they wont do so says a lot. And if i was doing anything wrong would I be going down the court route? Obviously not, these companies just hope and pray you won't know how, or have the time and inclination to hold them to account, well I will be.\n\nYou've been warned people, use this service at the risk of any funds you have in there.", 'review_date': '2022-06-17', 'review_time': '21:53:15', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
