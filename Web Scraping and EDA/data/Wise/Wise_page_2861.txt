Wise may appear cheaper than other providers on the surface, but there are hidden charges and the company holds on to funds much longer than any other forex provider before transferring them. I have been waiting 3 weeks for the company to transfer funds to my bank.\n\nPost-Wise\'s response - don\'t use Wise for larger amounts\nIt amuses me that the day after a friend of mine (who knows Wise well) emailed one of the Wise founders that they had been holding on to my money for too long, I received all the funds in my account and an email apologising for the delay. It reinforces the old adage, "it\'s not what you know, but who you know". It took one of the senior management to act before the junior staff took action. I would still not recommend Wise for large transfers - their compliance and customer service departments are not yet up to it - but if you want to change a few hundred £$€ forex, it\'s not a bad service.', 'review_date': '2021-09-09', 'review_time': '12:21:42', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nSep 8, 2021\nHello, Julian.\n\nWe're very transparent about our fees, and we'll always apply the mid-market live rate.
