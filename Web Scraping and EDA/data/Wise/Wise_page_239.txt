It's good to know that our platform has been user-friendly for you.\n\nRegarding the fees for international transactions, we understand your concern about the variation between transactions and banks. We want to assure you that at Wise, we always use the mid-market exchange rate for our transactions. This means you get the fairest and most transparent exchange rate available.\n\nThe cost of your transfer depends on several factors: the currencies you use, the payment method you choose, and the current market exchange rate. We explain in more detail how our commissions work here: https://wi.se/ourfees_\n\nWe also have a cool tool, that calculates the fees for your transfer, to see the cost beforehand. Check our virtual calculator here: https://wi.se/sendfees_\n\nAt Wise, we strive for consistency and transparency in our pricing structure, and we're continuously working to make our fee calculations clearer and more intuitive. Your feedback is invaluable in helping us identify areas where we can further improve our services.\n\nWise", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2023-06-27', 'CompanyReplyTime': '07:48:08'}
