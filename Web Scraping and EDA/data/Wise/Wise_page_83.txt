They promote it very well, saying that transfers are convenient and fast, but in reality, any transfer requires proof to be submitted.

It helps us combat money laundering, and keep everyone’s money safe. That way we can continue to provide even faster, cheaper and more transparent services.\n\nWe might ask you to upload a document that proves how you earn your money, such as your latest tax return. This is called your source of wealth, and is a regulatory requirement for some regions.\n\nHere we explain what we look for in these documents: https://wi.se/sow\n\nAbout the transfer that was refunded – if the remitter hasn't received the money, and our team requested you a specific document, it's because we need it to conduct the relevant investigation. You can also check how long refunds can take here: https://wi.se/refunddeliveryestimate\n\nOur goal is to complete all payments as fast as we can. But as a regulated financial institution, we do need to carry compliance related checks from time to time. Once these checks are successfully done, your account should operate normally – not all transfers undergo extra verification checks.\n\nWe'd like to have a second look at your case, you can contact us at: https://wi.se/contactus, or on X (Twitter), Facebook, and Instagram.
