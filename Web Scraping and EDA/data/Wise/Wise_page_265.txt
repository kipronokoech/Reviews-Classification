We appreciate you bringing this issue to our attention. However, it seems there has been some confusion regarding the situation.\n\nFirstly, we want to clarify that we're not an auction payment service. We're actually a regulated financial institution. The emails you received aren't from us and appear to be part of a phishing attempt. We take such matters seriously, and our security team can investigate the phishing message you received.\n\nTo assist us in this investigation, please provide a screenshot and the full original copy of the fraudulent email with headers. You can find instructions on how to obtain this information here: https://wi.se/trace-email\n\nOnce you have gathered the necessary details, please forward them to phishing@wise.com. Additionally, mark the email as spam to help block the phishing email account.\n\nIf you have a Wise account, we recommend taking a few precautionary measures. Firstly, if you entered your username and password on any suspicious website, please log out from all your devices and reset your password. Secondly, for enhanced security, we strongly advise setting up app-based 2-step login on your account. You can follow the instructions here: https://wi.se/2-step-login-setup\n\nIn the meantime, we suggest notifying the police about this incident.
