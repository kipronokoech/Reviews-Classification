However, you can still send to AED with us.\nBear in mind that you can still open an account in the UAE with us and use it to send money.\n\nWe're working hard on bringing the route and the multicurrency account back in the AED, because our mission is to make our products available everywhere.\n\nWe appreciate your understanding and hope to share some better news soon.\n\nWise", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2022-10-26', 'CompanyReplyTime': '08:44:17'}

The first one was put on hold because they sent it to the sanctions team. It took me until the 28 September to get my money back as I was kept in the dark on the supposed “checks” they were doing and asked them numerous times to cancel it. As for the second transfer, not only is it still not completed, but I haven’t received the refund either. They held my money during 9 September-11 October without providing any reason whatsoever and then “randomly” on 13 October they told me it was with the sanctions team and that I was requested to answer questions - so far the questions have not been shared with me. Wise has been holding my money for over a month without providing any reason and sending copy/paste holding emails. It is completely unacceptable and I can only wonder what they are doing with my money. Have they lost it? I should charge them interest tbh. Funny how companies can delay payments without being penalised but the consumer loses no matter what. 100% do not recommend using Wise.', 'review_date': '2022-10-21', 'review_time': '19:49:55', 'CompanyReply': 'Reply from Wise\nUpdated Oct 26, 2022\nHello, Melodie\n\nWe completely understand that the wait can be frustrating.
