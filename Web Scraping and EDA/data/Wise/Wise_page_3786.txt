In fact, the Ombudsman actually advises them to give this information to help the customer understand.\n\nOn top of that, the ombudsman advises them to give 30 days notice of account closure. They give none.\n\nIt has been nearly a month and they STILL have NOT RETURNED MY MONEY! They are really great at replying on Trustpilot, but when you try to get anything out of their customer service, it\'s silence.
