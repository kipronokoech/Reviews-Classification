I signed up to transfer money to Bali. The site promise if I linked my bank account, the transfer would happen that day. Against my better judgment, I did that, agreeing to send $1000 USD to Bali last Thursday. After I finished, it suddenly said the transfer would take three days, but could not happen until Monday (which is actually 5.) It didn't transfer until today, which is Six! Quite a difference from the same day, especially when it was bank account to bank account, and my bank account had $8000 US! My last transfer to Thailand took over a month to arrive. I have three words for anyone thinking of using this company: DO NOT USE!!\nThe company responded, and their answers are false. I already had one bank account on file with them. I've had an account with them for over 2 years. There is no reason for the delay, and the transfer took 2 days longer than their 3 days they said it would. I've had that bank account for 17 years. There is NO Justification for this delay, and even less for the month long delay to Thailand. They never stated any reason to me or in their generic reply.

It could be because the transfer was set up closer to the weekend/holidays, or because we needed to carry extra checks. You can read about it here: https://wi.se/howlongdotransferstake\n\nRegarding your previous transfer to Thailand, we understand that a month is certainly not the standard timeframe for our services. It's possible that certain regulatory checks or other factors might have contributed to the delay. We'd like to investigate this further and help you.

What happened? I\'m a pensioner and my pension comes into my wise account. About 6 weeks ago I went to send a small amount (under 20 €) to my grandaughter via the account I always send it to and on an average of once a month, a Dutch bank. It would normally arrive instantly. However this time it simply qould not send. Thinking it an issue with the phone I tried via another samsung phone with same result. I has my other older grandaughter who is with me download the app to her iPhone with same result. Then I tried via the website on a computer where I got an error saying money could not be sent to this account. Then to test I tried sending €1 to my best friend who was with me, same thing on all devices. I started wondering was it all accounts but it wasn\'t time to pay any bills yet for nearly another month so I couldn\'t try that. I contacted customer service who after several mails back & forth eventually asked for the account details. Thry then replied vaguely about local regulations out of their control and that they couldn\'t be more specific. This makes no sense since the friends account I was trying was, just like mine a euros wise account. So they were trying to tell me that local regulations prevented them sending from one euros wise account to another euros wise account as well as from a wise euros account to a Dutch ING bank account. This made zero sense and wasn\'t logical. I was left wondering which other accounts would do the same. I tested to my son\'s Dutch ING bank account and it sent but the question remained "for how long before it suddenly doesn\'t either? I wrote them asking this but they basically repeated what they said about local regulations and kept me hanging wondering how long before I suddenly can\'t send to any account at all and will have to pin everything out cash and if that may not suddenly fail for no good reason too. Goes without saying I will be having my pension sent elsewhere ASAP.\nThis is a resubmission of an earlier review which was taken down because I hadn\'t seen I had an email from trust pilot to provide proof to wise within 3 days. I was a bit distracted because I was having these issues. If this posts I will be sure to keep a sharp eye on my email and respond in time. Not that they need proof but it is an opportunity to get a review taken down and it worked.\nEdit: today one more account I can\'t send to. My daughter\'s Dutch bank account.', 'review_date': '2023-08-16', 'review_time': '01:50:05', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nAug 16, 2023\nHi Angela,\n\nFirstly, we genuinely appreciate your loyalty over the past five years and your trust in Wise.\n\nWe'd like to explain that we requested more info to be able to review the case closely, and even if you don't reply, the review isn't taken down.\n\nIt's important to clarify that our response about local regulations was not intended to be vague, but rather a reflection of the regulatory landscape we operate within.

They have no one available who seems to know what is going on at any given time and refer you to using the email system or just waiting for them to respond which can take 30 days. Hence telephoning them to discuss your account usually results in time wasted without any resolution. In the past I have had my account frozen several times which I have managed to overcome as we are not operating nefariously, however after three years and three separate business accounts with Wise, they have now again frozen me out for no reason or explanation whatsoever deactivating all my accounts. Fortunately, we only have £15,000 held between the three accounts having moved money out in anticipation of them behaving this way. We are now awaiting a refund. My advice would be just use these people (Wise) to transfer small amounts of money to different countries etc. If you go over a certain threshold which is £10,000 you will experience difficulties which will be very hard to overcome , even though you’re doing legitimate business. Stick to the High Street for your banking needs if at all possible at least there is accountability and customer service which is not possible at Wise and keep in mind, they are not a bank. They are merely a money transfer company… I invested in Wise shares on the stock market too, which plummeted like a rock and have yet to recover from its launch… it’s a shame they have not lived up to expectations.', 'review_date': '2023-08-15', 'review_time': '22:55:13', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nAug 17, 2023\nHey Terrence,\n\nWe hear you, and we understand having your accounts closed is frustrating, but rest assured that this isn't something we take lightly.
