I was notified by e mail after business hours.The company prides itself on transparency, but where is the transparency in closing an account and stating that you cannot give a reason, that customer service cannot give a reason, that there is an appeal process that can take up to 30 days. Meantime, one has no access to one's money. How can someone trust a company that does this? What if someone needs to send emergency money to a relative? What if someone signed a contract to buy a house where time is of the essence? What if you need your money for medical care? You have no access to your money and no explanation and no contact with anyone who can help.\nTrust is even more important than anything else ,even more important than ease and speed of transactions. The customer has to trust the company and feel the service is reliable. The company is doing very well with speed and ease of transfers but then completely destroys trust when they think there is a problem. Blocking your money, giving no explanation of what is going on, giving no updates, taking 30 days for the appeals process without contact or explanation or access to your money is not a way to build trust. It is a slower process than anything I have seen before in a financial service and not very efficient.\nUpdate:\nThankfully the appeals process went faster than announced.\nI still do not understand why the account was closed as I am just an ordinary person who has extremely simple and very transparent financial transactions.", 'review_date': '2022-11-16', 'review_time': '16:03:02', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nNov 16, 2022\nHello,\n\nWe understand having your account closed is frustrating, but rest assured this is never done without a reason.
