In particular, I do need to transfer money between countries, so I logically think that I should start with the send money link. But that assumes you have money to send. I keep my balances at zero until I need to send money. Going to the balances link at the bottom was not obvious to me at first as the place I needed to go. Why not incorporate adding money to the balance as part of the Send Money process? Once there is a balance to send the rest of the site seems pretty reasonable.', 'review_date': '2020-11-27', 'review_time': '19:28:16', 'CompanyReply': 'Reply from Wise\nDec 5, 2020\nHello Bill,\n\nThank you for sharing your feedback with us. We\'re sorry to hear you faced some troubles using our services.\n\nDo keep in mind that you don\'t need to add money to your balance first to send money. You just need to click on the green "send money" button to get started. As you are guided through the flow, at the end, you can pay for your transfer with the payment methods available.\n\nPlease have a look at our step by step guide here: https://wi.se/howtosendmoney.

In addition, the response deliberately ignores some of my main complaints,so I reduced my review from two stars to one.\n\nFirstly, TransferWise doesn't work with PayPal. Whether or not this is TransferWise's fault, customers have a right to know if this. If your service is incompatible with one of the most common ways to pay freelancers, customers have a right to know.\n\nWhen I opened my account, I didn't have to provide the ID that was needed recently. When the new rules were created, TW did not contact me to say 'your money has now been locked until you provide ID.' They just waited until I needed the money. Only a two star review got their attention. Why no email or phone call? The rule change was important enough to freeze my money, but not important enough to contact me?\n\nIn addition, different support staff all have a poor understanding of TW's app layout, and I was repeatedly asked to do impossible things because staff don't understand the layout of their own company's app.", 'review_date': '2020-12-05', 'review_time': '08:24:23', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nDec 5, 2020\nHello Andrew,\n\nThank you for sharing your feedback with us.
