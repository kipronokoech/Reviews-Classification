Mind you, it must be a live photo, not an on-hand photo of a passport. Urgent transfer while I am traveling, and I had to recall my passport which was about to be submitted for visa extension by my visa agent.\n\nMany hours later, not verified. Call to customer service (for which I needed to Google for the phone number since they virtually hide it on their website), After a 20-minute wait in a queue, I was told they would expedite, which had no effect.\n\nThe customer service guy told me that despite the block on transfers I would be able to send money to my linked bank account. This was a lie: I came up against the same pending-verification issue when I tried, also when trying to transfer from a bank account.\n\nNow more than a day later still waiting for my transfer to commence, and still seeing the same ("it may take up to an hour" to verify my info message. The "Estimated arrival date" shows yesterday. A transfer which normally takes seconds ... I have no clue if and when the money will ever arrive. I have no clue whether I need to hold onto my passport to take another live photo later of I can submit it for visa extension.\n\nOn another Wise issue, I had a debit card which was hacked (and it was not fun to go through the process of resolving the fraudulent charges -- took weeks) and after receiving an unusable replacement card and attempting to receive a replacement I was given instructions that did not work and now months later Wise has not replied to my multiple emails telling them that what they told me to do does not work and to please instruct me what to do instead. I filed a formal complaint weeks ago about that and have not received a reply about that (the complaint goes to the same department that has failed to reply to my emails, not to someone like an ombudsman so I have low expectations that anything will be done).\n\nThis is not a company whose service can be relied upon! When it works it works well, when it doesn\'t you\'re screwed and your money is locked up.\n\nIt is clear to me that this company lacks respect or regard for its customers and the hardships they cause them else they would not repeatedly give patently wrong info, make false commitments, and ignore attempts to resolve problems and complaints.', 'review_date': '2023-10-14', 'review_time': '07:28:21', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
