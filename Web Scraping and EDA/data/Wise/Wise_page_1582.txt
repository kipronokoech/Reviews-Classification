It was working for a year well, but later became really frequent to ask some papers of the company. Which is not a problem if they are not stopping you account for few days till get these papers. And their last maneuver is more annoying. They asked for multy currency account actvation from one day to anther to be able to send any money, but when i wanted to pay for that i see this message: ''Your multi-currency account is inactive. For more information, please contact us.'' And still not working... Maybe for personal use this company os okay, but for a business owner it's a terrible solution and experience.", 'review_date': '2022-06-15', 'review_time': '10:42:36', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

I cannot run a business this way. It is way too long. Worse, it only happens when I send money to people with a name you don't like because I have no issues with any others. It is not random so pls don't insult my intelligence. You use an algorithm to bounce some out for checks. By doing this I then spend time chasing you to get this solved and this is time that is taken away from my business. You have many complaints about this. I get nowhere with your customer service bc they can't do anything. If you have to run checks then you need to expand this team hugely. I tried to cancel the last transaction when I saw this was going to happen again and you still took my money and are making me go through the 15 day wait. I need my money and very angry that you have take my money for such a long period. So yes, I'm really really unhappy with WISE and looking to move my money. It was an experiment to try business banking with you; I didn't close my other business account. Experiments often don't work out.

{'platform': 'Wise', 'id': '62a992ad0031539b61402802', 'stars': 1, 'title': 'I have no words for how disappointed I am', 'message': "I recently reviewed Wise but as I have had many (10+) interactions with them all of which have generally been disappointing I thought this warranted another review with an updated of my situation. My account was vished on the 1st of June. Since then my account has been blocked and my access revoked and I have not had access to my funds. (As of today, that will be 2 weeks). On the 2-5th of June Wise decided that they would take the Jubilee bank holiday off so no phone calls were being answered and live chat was unavailable. How this was a good decision for an online based bank is beyond me. I managed to call someone from the US wise branch who couldn't help me but could see that my emails had been received and someone was dealing with it. Keep in mind that no on had responded to my email to say someone was dealing with it. During this time I was in a foreign country with no access to money.\n\nOn 8th of June (a week after the incident), I was emailed by Wise to say that I would be reimbursed for what was in my bank account. I assume because during the Vish I tried to verify it was Wise however they were uncontactable. I was required to provide proof of the bank account I wanted to transfer the money into, which I did immediately. When I responded with the proof, I asked for a) a confirmation that the proof I provided was sufficient as I didn't want to hold up having access to my money and b) an ETA on how long this would take. I heard nothing for days, despite my emails. I was not expecting an exact timeframe but I didn't understand why things would take a long time as the investigation (where they made the decision to reimburse me) had already been conducted AND Wise transfers take under 10 seconds. (Isn't this part of their marketing campaign, how fast their transfers are?)\n\nI then called up on the 13th (t+12 days after the incident and moneyless) to speak to someone, to have them tell me that no, in fact, my proof of identity was not sufficient. They told me what else they needed and that was when the call got cut out. She then emailed me with what else they needed which was much appreciated. I immediately responded with an official bank letter and again asked for confirmation it was sufficient. I heard nothing back from this email. As I now had completely given up on Wise responding or updating me on things, I then called up later on in the afternoon to check with someone that the proof was sufficient. She confirmed it was. It is now 2 days later and I have heard nothing from Wise.\n\nAll throughout this I am unable to deal with anyone in the security team who are dealing with my case and the people who respond on the phone calls also do not have any information as to why things are taking so long. I have been told numerous times 'they will contact you as soon as they have any information' which is entirely untrue as they couldn't even contact me to tell me they needed a different form of bank proof for the transfer.\n\nI am trying not to let the many reviews of people saying that Wise are a horrible company who don't care about their customers make me worry about whether I may ever get my money back. But I am at the point of needing to borrow money from people to pay rent and eat and I can't get them to even give me an indication of how much longer this might take.", 'review_date': '2022-06-15', 'review_time': '10:05:01', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
