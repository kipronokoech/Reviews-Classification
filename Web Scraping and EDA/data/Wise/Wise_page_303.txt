Will never use them again. What a mess.\nBottom line if the transfer needs to happen, and it's semi complicated (Power of Attorney's etc..) use bank to bank transfer.\nIn regards to their canned response below...Well as all canned responses, it is meaningless. We were in contact with wise support over 6 times, each time providing all documents asked. On the 4rth and 5th time both separate support persons told me that all the documentation was there and that it looked good. That we just had to wait for the verification team. I stressed that if there was anything else that the verification team needed to not hesitate to contact us. The next business day we wake up to see that the transaction was cancelled.. I try to contact support and now all of a sudden they will not talk to me without talking to my mother first, even though I am listed as a helper and the previous 2 times they had no problem talking to me first. So, the end result is having spent 400 euros (bank charge for the transfer to wise) for absolutely nothing.", 'review_date': '2023-05-24', 'review_time': '10:16:13', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nMay 24, 2023\nHi Frank,\n\nWe're sorry to hear about the frustrating experience you've had while trying to assist your elderly mother with a large transfer.
