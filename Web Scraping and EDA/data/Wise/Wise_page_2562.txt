However last time the website prevented me from completing an instant transfer and forced me to set up a balance account from which the transfer would be made 2 days later. The transfer value was lower and a day later than that quoted. When I complained via the chat service the first representative just cut me off stating that my internet had disconnected. I received her message instantly! The second customer service representative engaged but did not listen or investigate, choosing to use cut and paste pre prepared texts answers with no relevance. Being told that the reason that this happened is because I had been late in transferring the money when it had been done instantly and they had had my money for 3 days is frustrating. We went around in circles a little longer before I stated I would have to make an official complaint. A measure of any service is its competence or not to solve problems when they arise. Customer Service Manual Page 1, Paragraph 1, should read first apologise and then listen. The WISE representatives I spoke to did not apply these basic maxims. Be cautious about using this company.', 'review_date': '2021-11-15', 'review_time': '14:02:05', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nDec 21, 2021\nHello there,\n\nWe'd like to get more details on what happened and help you further.
