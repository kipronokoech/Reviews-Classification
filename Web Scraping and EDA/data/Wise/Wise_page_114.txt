It was a seemless process signing up and we linked into our accounting software very easily, but after a few transactions we became 'deactivated'. There was no communication prior or after this happened. Nobody contated us to ask any questions about the transactions and it seems there is nobody that you can speak to about this. There is a customer support number and all they tell you is that it could take up to 40 days and they have no access to the team dealing with it! We emailed the appeals team and a week later still no reply. They seem to make it very difficult to do anything one you have been deactivated as you cannot log in to do anything, even to view!\nThey now have a large sum of our money which we need to run our business.\nIf you need to transfer any money abroad I would suggest only putting the essential sums into their account and transferring, then at least when you get 'deactivated'.", 'review_date': '2023-08-25', 'review_time': '14:02:42', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nAug 25, 2023\nHey Richard,\n\nDeactivating accounts isn't something we take lightly. It's often a result of a conflict with our Terms of Service or Customer Agreement, or due to a discrepancy with a financial law. We can't always share the exact reason for the deactivation, due to how we're regulated. However, you can find some possible reasons here: https://wi.se/accountdeactivation\n\nOur appeals team will reach out to you once they have further updates regarding your account. While this process can take a while in some occasions, our team do everything they can to keep you updated.\n\nAs for the remaining money in your account, we'll work on sending it back to you. First, we need to carry out due diligence checks. While we do that, your money and information are safe and secure.\n\nThe Wise Team", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2023-08-25', 'CompanyReplyTime': '16:25:27'}
