Then when I tried to send a few thousand to the same recipient, they took it out of my bank account, closed my Wise account for no valid reason, and kept the money.\n\nI have made an appeal, but they say for "regulatory reasons" they need three months\' worth of bank statements. Their demand is a gross violation of privacy and none of their damn business (unless they are trying to figure out another scam). I sent them one page identifying me and the account number, which is all they need.\n\nAnd of course "customer service" is completely separate from appeals and knows nothing.\n\nMy recommendation would be don\'t send more money through Wise than you can afford to lose.', 'review_date': '2021-06-08', 'review_time': '16:21:40', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nJun 16, 2021\nWe understand having your account closed is frustrating, but rest assured this isn't done without a reason.
