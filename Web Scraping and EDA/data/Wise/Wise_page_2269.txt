Money sent from wallet goes to a bank situated in that country. Example in my case I send from SGD wallet it goes to CIMB SG. Not local CIMB. I manage to track down the money after call CIMB SG. Wise could have stated it clearly when sending money from SGD wallet. Both bank names for Malaysia and SG are the same which I only realized later. Giving Wise 4 stars since I am still using that. Once more able check many times before send money. Send in small amount first if it is your first time! Wise won\'t help if it goes into the wrong account!\n\nIf you transfer your money into wrong account.. Likely say bye bye to the money even if that account does not exist on the bank.\n\nHappened to me last week and Wise completely washed their hands off the issue. Not willing to even help me contact my local bank to ask them to refund back the amount (this was told by my local CIMB to ensure that they will transfer the amount correctly). Issue here was I suppose to transfer o Singapore CIMB but accidentally selected local Malaysia CIMB instead. Wise will not check if an account number has the correct formating, bank account number etc, so u can enter all zeros or any number and they will still send the money like some dumbfcks.\n\nSure they are cheapest way of transfer.. As long u don\'t mess up. If you do, be prepared to lose your money. Suggest to transfer in small amounts first rather than transferring in big amount at one go.\n\nI\'ve already sent email and called wise at Singapore number on this issue. Wise just aren\'t helpful. Expect everything solved by customer. They kept saying they can\'t help to contact the bank as this is against their "regulation". Bunch of bull$h1t and bad service. CIMB bank is bad at supporting this too, account number does not exists for CIMB Malaysia but they still have not rejected my transfer. The transfer number of this incident: 352429799\n\nImagine losing your hard earned salary money and nobody cares to assist on this.\nWise had lost a loyal customer as previously I\'ve been using it to transfer to IBKR for US investments.
