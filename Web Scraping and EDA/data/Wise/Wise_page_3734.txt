I wanted to send $100 to my sister for holidays. I paid the fee for the transaction as expected. This was no issue or concern. Then the funds transferred to Turkey in a timely manner which again no issue. But when my sister received in her accoun it is only $62. The remaining was taken out as additional fees which I did not know or expect. As you can see it is more than 1/3 of funds which is in my opinion way too much. Totally disappointing and felt like a ripe-off. I will not use this service with this fee structure.\nThanks.', 'review_date': '2020-12-04', 'review_time': '21:40:26', 'CompanyReply': 'Reply from Wise\nDec 7, 2020\nThanks for your review - we appreciate feedback of all kinds.\nIt sounds like you sent a SWIFT transfer to Turkey, which can incur additional fees charged by intermediary banks. When using our service to send these kinds of transfers, we warn our customers before they pay that their recipient might receive less money due to the fees.', 'CompanyReplyDate': '2020-12-07', 'CompanyReplyTime': '15:26:23'}

I live in Spain but most of my income is in GBP and I have to make regular transfers. Before using Transferwise I had to transfer a minimum of Â£5000 in order to get a reasonable rate which was far from convenient. Factor in the cost of a call to the UK, transfer charges and having to wait a couple of days before the money arrived, it was not the best of experiences.\n\nSwitching to Transferwise was a revelation. From my first pain free online transfer to the present day I have watched the user interface expand to provide a flexible and comprehensive transfer experience. Along the way they have passed on efficiency savings by reducing transfer charges and they routinely transfer my money into my Spanish bank account seconds after receiving my GBP payment. Although they advised of possible delays due to the COVID pandemic I have not experienced any problems despite the fact that they have had to restructure around working from home.\n\nA very happy customer.\n\nJohn Copland', 'review_date': '2020-12-04', 'review_time': '19:35:58', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
