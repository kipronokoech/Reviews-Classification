However, as my experience shows, they can take several days to process a transaction under the guise of 'we are running some checks' and the truth of this matter is not advertised. In fact, the goalposts of how long you need to wait for a transfer to be made change all the time. When I made the transfer, they gave an estimate of 2 working days but at the end of that timeframe, the transfer had still not been made and the waiting time increased indefinitely to 'we need a bit more time'. How much is a bit more time Wise?! Certainly longer than how long a bank takes to process a transfer. Awful service.
