{'platform': 'Wise', 'id': '633a3eb04a5fff53cad4b5cb', 'stars': 2, 'title': 'card security and support needs improvement', 'message': "I was really interested with the function of Wise as it saves a lot when it comes to currency exchange. However, considering they might excel in such feature, I am personally very skeptical towards their online secuirty and card support due to my recent experience. I opened the account during post covid times, which I did not plan to travel within short period of time, thus I added 200 GBP into the account and spent 5 GBP to obtain the physical card, after I have obtained the card I have never used it due to the fact that I have had no travel plans and there was no need of foreign currency. 7 months later, I came home from work lying on my bed while playing my phone and all of a sudden wise sent my notifications that there are 2 transactions in USD and PEN (Peruvian Sol) that were approved with my card. I immediately froze my card and reported those transactions as fraudlent. I do understand that cards get compromised and frauds do happen in the modern era and they are inevitable as it happened to myself multiple times, but I can hardly believe that despite never using the card for anything my card details still get exposed. Also, I am not sure if I am expecting too much, but banks in the UK usually stop the transaction when it is being suspicious (i.e. merchant being in another geological location, currency type not matching records...etc) and confirm that it is really the bank account holder's intention before processing it, while Wise just let it all happen. All I can do is to freeze the card if I am conscious and awake at that time and report to them after the incidents occur. If I am asleep at that time I could imagine all of my funds held within the account would be spent by the fraudster without any consequences, lucky for me 195GBP is not a big amount of money and I managed to freeze the card and the fraudster only managed to spend roughly 5 GBP with my card. Yet, considering the lack of security measurements for the card usage I am rather skeptical against Wise, hopefully they can further develop and improve in terms of this aspect.", 'review_date': '2022-10-03', 'review_time': '03:45:20', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
