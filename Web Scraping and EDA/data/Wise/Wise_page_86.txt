However, about a month ago, I discovered unauthorized withdrawals from my credit card originating in Thailand using Apple Pay, even though I don't own any Apple devices. Specifically, there were 139 transactions, amounting to a total of $13,000, occurring at the exact same time I was making withdrawals in Switzerland.\n\nUpon reaching out to Wise, I received only generic form responses that didn't address my specific concerns. I want to emphasize that I never authorized these withdrawals. I'm also surprised that Wise didn't flag these transactions initially, considering they took place simultaneously from opposite parts of the world and were so frequent in such a short span.

( I have my own way of having security and I cannot update my hardware to use the newer chrome or firefox browsers. I use private fork browsers including MyPal and Basilisik. Yesterday Basilisik worked fine to login to into my account just fine. Today I can see the website but I cannot login. I personally have been a client of Wise for many years. I don't use the site more than about 6 times a year. I personally don't like their sudden change from the old blue site to their new green site. Whoever asked to change the while website anyway?? Fortunately I have been able to do transfers, up until today. Now I can't get into my account unless I use a public computer with the horrible windows 10 which I despise. I might be able to use an alternative browser in an alternative live OS system linux or other obscure OS that can handle a higher version of firefox. I am a senior citizen and I have no use in useless changes to browsers or saving passwords on line . I also cannot use 2 step verification because I use only my own laptops. I manage my own passwords and handle online security in my own way. I think it is very very inconsiderate for Wise to change their login system so that older equipment cannot access the login procedure. If they don't fix there login so that Basilisk can access it, I'm afraid I will have to elsewhere for my foreign exchange transactions. Sorry, I like Wise, but I have better things to do with my time and limited money than buy and maintain new operating systems. No respect for seniors or telephone communication. Afraid I will have to change foreign exchange companies for those with telephone support. (Wise used to have this , but it doesn't work anymore). If Wise will make login accessible to older browsers ( even those which worked yesterday) will continue to use them. The new technology is NOT MORE secure. It is very big mess when it doesn't work. Keep things simple and learn how your OS works. Would like to see everybody use encrypted text files. Do the majority of people even have the ability to read an encrypted floppy disk? Don't even have floppy or CD drives in their new stupid OS computers so you can't do what I can do. I don't even have my own traceable internet connection. I have my own way of keeping data secure and it is exactly the opposite of using new expensive technology. It is primitive and very simple if you don't follow the main stream. I have never had a lost transfer or experiences with malware. People under 30 years old have know idea of the older more reliable yet simplistic technology. Everything today is new and NOT IMPROVED, just time consuming and works in manner that NO HUMAN can understand. SMART TECHNOLOGY IS NOT SMART AT ALL. All computers are just fairly dumb machines that can only understand binary code and machine language. The best way to protect data is to NEVER let sensitive remain in a machine which is connected to the internet or doesn't change IP's very often. By the way I found out recently that Tangerine bank in Canada is no longer permitting any interac money requests to be accepted by Wise or any other Foreign Exchange company to be carried out. Their website is also visual pile of visual chaos. Wake up WISE!! You are forcing people to live in a technological prison, especially senior citizens.
