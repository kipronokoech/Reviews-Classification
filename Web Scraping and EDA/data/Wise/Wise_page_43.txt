I\'ve spent hours going back and forth with customer service to get my verification processed, and I\'ve been gaslighted every step of the way. It\'s not normal for a "financial institution" to behave like this.\n\nWhat should be a simple process that takes a minute has taken days. I\'ve submitted the documents multiple times, and each time the CS has said it was fine, only to get rejected later with nothing more than a templated response. No specific details, nothing detailing what exactly went wrong - just a generic response and a link to upload it again.\n\nWhen speaking directly with support here, they have the same nonsense response: they can\'t communicate directly with the verification team, but they\'ll "escalate" the issue. After speaking with one rep for some time, they even admitted that "escalate" doesn\'t really mean anything because they can\'t call or even email the verification team directly. Genuinely outrageous.\n\nHilariously, during this process, I\'m continuously "reassured" that this is for MY safety. And on social media, they are suggesting to others that their money is safe. To me, for funds to be safe, they need a certain level of liquidity. That means, if I can\'t withdraw my funds in a timely manner, they\'re not safe.\n\nSo, after this whole nightmarish experience, I decided to cancel. And I\'m sure you can guess how that process has gone...\n\nTransfers in progress will take 3-5 days to return.\n\nFunds in the account are inaccessible.\n\nAnd still, after everything, I\'m waiting for a verification process that is shockingly broken, and I\'m at the mercy of a customer support system that is disinterested, unresponsive, dismissive, and unhelpful.\n\nI\'ve used Wise for years, and have sent a lot of money through it - but honestly, this whole experience and the absolutely horrendous support I\'ve received has not only impacted my trust in the company, it\'s pushed me to do something I literally never do: write a bad review.\n\nBe warned: if you want access to your funds or any sort of customer support - Wise is not for you.', 'review_date': '2023-10-12', 'review_time': '22:43:20', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
