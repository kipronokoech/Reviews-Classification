They refused to compensate me for this damage and also refused to reimburse me with my costs to open the account with them. They stated all of this is because "I have utilized my account with them"\n\nIt feels Wise is allowing them selves to act as they wish without any respect to damages caused on my end due to their internal policies. I wonder what is the best way to make them meet the consequences of their behavior?\n\nI see that Wise is a UK company.\nAppreciate your help to get them pay for how they treated me.\nThank you!', 'review_date': '2022-06-01', 'review_time': '19:27:03', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nJun 2, 2022\nHello Nir,\n\nSorry to hear your account was deactivated.
