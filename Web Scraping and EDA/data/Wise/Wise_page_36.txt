It is now 18 days since the initial transfer was sent and has taken 5 emails over this period to finally get information from Wise that apparently it can take a month to have the funds returned. Firstly I don\'t believe that in this age of instant transfers that it takes a month to return our money! Secondly Wise customer service is so poor that each email we sent took 3 days to get a reply. These replies were all generic with no actual action taken until after 2 weeks when they finally decided to forward the issue onto their team to look into! Wise has no contact phone number to speak to customer service and it takes 2 weeks for them to look into any issues! Don\'t believe the salesman style words on their website saying "Don\'t worry if your transfer fails we will return your money" as this is the second time I have had this prolonged drawn out battle to get my money back!', 'review_date': '2023-10-16', 'review_time': '23:38:36', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
