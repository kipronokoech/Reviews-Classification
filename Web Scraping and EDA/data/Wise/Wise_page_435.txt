Because of the difficulty and confusion, I immediately cancelled the card, were lucky enough to get someone on the phone from Wise and were assured that the $100.00 deposit into the Travel Card would be reimbursed. 10 days later, still no reimbursement. My current Wise AUD Statement indicates that I have AUD$100.00 still. How do I get this put back into my personal bank account as promised by Wise?\nI would appreciate a call to clarify and clear up this issue.\nI do use Wise for international transfers from time to time and have no issues with that service, but this Travel Card issue has just been a debacle.', 'review_date': '2023-03-25', 'review_time': '00:01:00', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
