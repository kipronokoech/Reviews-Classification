Its a scam!', 'message': 'I have used wise for the past few months and didnt have much issue. But recently on one of the transfers that was pretty urgent for me and they hadnt processed it for days. Every couple days i have to follow up and it takes a couple more days to get a response only to ask me to wait longer. Its been 2 weeks, they wouldnt transfer nor refund the money. Its a scam!! There are so many better services out there.\n\nI believe lately, after they changed to Wise, it has turned into a fraud company. If you could take a look at all the 1 star reviews you can see that they are all recent. I wish i had known better than to use their service.

This is so we comply with our regulators while keep our platform safe for everyone using it - including you. We aim to complete all checks as fast as possible, and we'll always keep you updated along the way.\n\nPlease reach us at https://wi.se/contactus_, and we'll take a closer look to understand better the reason for the delay.\n\nAll the best,\nWise Team.", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2021-05-20', 'CompanyReplyTime': '11:03:14'}
