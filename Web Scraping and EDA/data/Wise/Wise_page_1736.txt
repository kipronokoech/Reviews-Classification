I’ve always greatly appreciated this bank. However, at the beginning of May I was supposed to receive a transfer. As an international student, it’s important for me to receive money or else I can get in big trouble with basic things like rent, food etc. The transfer was successfully sent and received on my side according to my parent’s bank but not on my side. I never saw the transfer because it was held by Wise. I called multiple agents and they all had a different story. Some said I should check back in by the end of the week, others said in 2 weeks. One even misled me by saying that I could call them back on Saturday (the next day) if I didn’t receive the money by then. I even asked him specifically if my call would be received and he said yes. To my horror I called the next day and found out they were only open from Monday to Friday. Wise staff y’all can even check the recorded conversation, I ain’t lying. So, I am really disappointed. One of the agents, who seemed a little more sure about himself said that I could escalate the case starting the 23rd but after the whole fiasco of being told to wait 10 business days and being told to call on Saturday, I’m not so sure I trust this 23rd date. And it’s money I really need. So yes I’m writing a bad review because I didn’t know wise could be so unreliable. The transfer has now been on hold for the past 2 weeks and I need to squeeze from my savings to pay all the stuff here so I can sustain myself. I really loved this bank and I don’t understand why the sanctions review is taking so long. I don’t like to paint something all black for just one mistake. That’s immature and wrong. That’s why I gave it 2 stars. But really like, I trusted that my money would have arrived by now but it still hasn’t and I’m suffering because of it. The money might not even come this month at all so I am upset. I hope they do better.', 'review_date': '2022-05-16', 'review_time': '05:11:32', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
