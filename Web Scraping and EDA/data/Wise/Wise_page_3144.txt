So they instantly took from my card 20.62 EUR (but only received 20 EUR in Wise account due to some extra costs in regards to my visa card - other companies Based in London do not have those \'extra cost\' when I use them on regular basis to pay and withdraw various funds).\nConsidering that withdrawal was not possible via simple card refund withdrawal method used by other companies, they used SWIFT and from 20 EUR sent I received in my account 16.17 EUR. So in total 22.25% loss just to open an account to see if I can use their services for some specific transfer I am expecting.\n\nThere is nothing "wise" about this. My advice is to either use regular bank or some other payment company. They constantly say how fast, transparent and cheaper they are but when you see options to send or withdraw money then its different ball game. I think that between two wise accounts those fees are probably lower than others but to get that money out of wise account and into your bank account, you are most likely looking at SWIFT transfer again so there is no point to have \'digital fast cheap\' payment on between peers when you need money in your bank account or Visa/Master Cards.. And btw that transfer took same amount of time (approx 2.5 days) as you will get with normal SWIFT bank to bank transfer.', 'review_date': '2021-06-10', 'review_time': '19:18:02', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nJun 17, 2021\nHello, Steph.\n\nWe do support local withdraws just fine, so you shouldn't have any issues with them.
