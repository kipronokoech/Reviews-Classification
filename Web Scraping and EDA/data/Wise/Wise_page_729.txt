You are risking loosing not only your money but also your reputation by association with this shamble. My account was fine for a short while and then they simply decided to break it and turn everything into a mess. I started getting endless e-mails asking to verify this verify that and no matter how many replies you send you get another nasty email. So it now reached a point where they told me to start taking selfies with documents and then I send these selfies and they reply "we cannot see them clearly". One of their "helpful" support operators told me to go get latest iphone because according to her she prefers selfies from an iphone and because I have an android they are now inflicting endless damages and threatening with more damages. I now have to go round my clients telling them they cannot send payments to me and we have to look for alternative arrangements. Imagine this nightmare. And all this because they simply felt like hitting this account this time. Yours will be next. Avoid them like plague. So unprofessional.
