They display low-fee on the transaction fee only to inflate that at the last minute on the payment screen.\n\nI made a transaction and was quoted a fee of Â£2.60 marked as "Total fees (included)". Upon reaching the page where it asks you to choose payment method, I chose "Credit Card". The fee was changed to Â£3.80. This was clearly highlighted and I was fine with this increase and clicked on the button "Continue to Payment".\n\nHowever, after entering payment details and hitting \'Pay\', the fee has jumped to Â£12.44. This is clearly misleading and false advertising. For the record, I used a Mastercard for payment.\n\nI called the phone support and requested for the transaction to be reversed or the additional fee refunded. They were unable to do either. I will now be reporting this matter to the Financial Ombudsman as the way their system is calculating fees is clearly misleading and possibly illegal.\n\nIf the complaints team at Wise is reading this then I request that the additional fee that has been charged to me be refunded.', 'review_date': '2021-09-03', 'review_time': '12:23:40', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nSep 13, 2021\nHello, Ahmad.\n\nCould be that you were using an international payment?

That's because, that's only then we'll know if you're using an international card, for example.\n\nWe're working towards a free to use product, but we haven't reached this goal just yet.
