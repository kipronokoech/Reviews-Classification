I wanted to transfer $25,000 and I would told online to transfer $25,014 the other amounts to be the small fee that your firm charges. Instead of transferring this amount exactly which the website asked for I transferred $25,000 even. So the transfer didn't go because they told me online I had to shrink the transfer to cover the $14. The website said it was waiting for another transfer of $14. Who would transfer $14, the wire transfer cost more. So there should have been an option simple and clear shrink the transfer and proceed. Instead I spent about an hour on chat and got nowhere. Then the next day finally someone gave me a link and explained it to me and I was able to transfer the funds using the medium rate online. Everything worked out, but it was a bureaucratic nightmare. We need to learn from our mistakes. I made a mistake clearly by not transferring the exact amount, but they should have made an option to enable me to shrink the transfer and proceed with one click. We're talking about $14 on $25,000. Over and above that, and aside from the time and the aggravation to complete the transfer, everything went was reasonably smooth and the cost of doing the transfer was very fair and equitable. I would do it again but I would be more attentive this time. Probably I wouldn't even go online and ask for a transfer would rather just transfer the funds and then go online and convert them and send them in real time.", 'review_date': '2021-10-28', 'review_time': '12:11:29', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
