I have made transfers from this account before, it was already established and verified.\n\nChat help was HORRIBLE and it's obviously farmed out to someone who is just using macros and trying to juggle 3 chats at once from various companies.

That made the entire process very nerve racking even though my experience this time was that it was smooth.\n\nI couldn\'t imagine my bank saying to me "...yes we can transfer that cash but there is 0.01% chance that once its left your account it will remain in limbo for 3 months while you obtain a solicitor and contact the financial ombudsman.....". (Google transferwise scam for a facebook group containing tons of such stories)\n\nFor that kind of amount, I would need to know for 100% in advance that my money won\'t be blocked. 99.99% (if its that high) is not good enough.\n\nWould definitely recommend for lower value transfers though.', 'review_date': '2021-08-10', 'review_time': '14:19:15', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nAug 19, 2021\nHello, Michael.\n\nWhile it is correct that we need to carry extra checks on your transfers (no matter the amount), we do our best to complete these checks as fast as we can, and it never takes us 3 months to verify your transfer.\n\nIt is also important to note that when sending larger amounts, if we need additional information, we'll get in touch with you and request that.
