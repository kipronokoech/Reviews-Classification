However, as a financial institution, with the priority of keeping your money safe, we can't get around routine compliance related checks.\n\nWe need to know whoâ€™s using our service, why theyâ€™re using it, and that their money comes from a legitimate place. It helps us combat money laundering, and keep everyoneâ€™s money safe. That way we can keep providing you even faster, cheaper and more transparent service.\n\nThat's not all â€“ we also have different regulatory requirements in different regions. Because of this, we might need to ask more, or different, questions, depending on where you move money to or from, or where you live.\n\nWe know this is personal information. So we try to ask you the least we can, to still complete all the checks. We always store your information securely, in line with our privacy policy. You can check it here: https://wi.se/privacy_others\n\nSo, if your transfer is taking a little longer, donâ€™t worry. If we need any extra information from you, weâ€™ll get in touch. Just keep an eye on your email â€” including your spam inbox â€” for any messages from us. And you can check your transfer progress in the Activity section of your Wise account.\n\nOnce we're done with the checks, we're ready to fly your money again.\n\nWe thank you for your patience.\n\nWise", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2023-04-04', 'CompanyReplyTime': '08:32:24'}

As you finish setting up your transfer, we lock the rate for a specific amount of time. Itâ€™s important that you send your money to us right away, so we receive your money on time. As long as we receive your money on time, youâ€™ll get that rate locked.\n\nIf your money doesnâ€™t reach us in time, weâ€™ll still convert and send it as soon as possible. But weâ€™ll use the mid-market rate instead.\n\nWe get our rate from Reuters, who update the rate in real-time during the trading market opening hours.\nRead more here: https://wise.com/gb/mid-market-rate\n\nSo the rate is locked only if you set up a transfer, on our website you can still see the mid-market rate.\n\nWise", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2023-04-04', 'CompanyReplyTime': '08:40:08'}
