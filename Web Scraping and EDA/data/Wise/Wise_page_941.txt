I much preferred the name Transferwise, I find "Wise" quite pretentious! It would be great if customers could have the option again to not have to get a text message confirmation every time they want to log in to their account? Transferwise didn\'t use to do this. Also my online banking doesn\'t require this and that\'s much more of a security risk than using Transferwise, as no one can use my Transferwise account to transfer money out of my account unless they have access to my bank account! Yet my bank doesn\'t require this.\n\nAlso unfortunately there are many clicks involved in doing the repeat transfer option, which you would hope would be simple and streamlined, but is not streamlined at all. You still have to click on many different things. For example it doesn\'t remember the method of payment but automatically defaults to one, which is not the method I use, so I have to change it each time. I wish it would just remember. And then after that there are multiple clicks such as even after I\'ve transferred the funds from my bank account I still have to click on "pay" even though I\'ve already paid and then it comes up with a thing to pay even though I\'ve paid and only if I go into and out of that does it come up with a "I\'ve paid" button.
