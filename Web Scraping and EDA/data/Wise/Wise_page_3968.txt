Transactions go through with out cvv. I was shocked to see that. Earlier in the year had another issue with app displaying card declined while after 5 mins that transaction goes through. Resulted in makes double transactions as I was in impression transaction did not go through. It was horrible support. So this time with cvv issue did not even bother to call them as they can't understand simple English. Not sure is they are FSA or PCI compliant. If they are then it is shame for FSA and the PCI auditor.\nThere was CVV number box. but by mistake i clicked next. It should have prompted me or failed the transaction. But no, it went through.

All card transactions are required to have some sort of security step, or 3DS. Card transactions that don't require this are being protected by other security policies. In regards to CVV and information of the card, TransferWise passes the information you provide to us to your bank. Your bank will either approve or reject the payment on their end.\n\nIf you didn't see any field to enter in your CVV, please get in touch with our support team with a screenshot of this so we can investigate it with you. You can contact us on social media or here through our support centre: https://wi.se/contactus.\n\nTransferWise is a safe and regulated way to send money. We're regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority of the UK and the EEA.
