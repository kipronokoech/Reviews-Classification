Using them for the first time under their new name 'Wise' a week ago, I was checking the exchange rate and entered ¬£5000. This money transferred through to Wise from a saved card, charging me a ¬£15 fee, WHILE THE BOX REQUESTING THE 3 DIGITS FROM THE BACK OF MY CARD WAS EMPTY. I had not even got the card out of my purse.\nI have tried for a week to contact Wise. Their phone number cut off after every option I chose. Also they are NOT CONTACTABLE AFTER 4PM UK TIME.\nI emailed them with no response and reported a glitch in their system with no response. After 5 days I managed to get through on their chat line to an employee called Singh to whom I described my problem. He ended our conversation, whilst I was typing to him, because he thought we had lost our internet connection.\nI have today given up on contacting Wise. I completed my transfer, before I wanted to, as I do not trust them to hold such a large sum of money securely.\nI couldn't see how to delete the debit card I had stored with Wise. For my own financial safety, I have contacted my bank to get my card replaced.", 'review_date': '2021-09-19', 'review_time': '12:12:01', 'CompanyReply': 'Reply from Wise\nSep 30, 2021\nHello Jill,\n\nRest assured that security is our top priority, and we understand your concern. As you have the card saved, what could have happened is that by mistake you\'ve clicked "continue" before typing the 3 digits. When that happens, your bank should decline the transaction from their side, since the numbers weren\'t typed. If the transaction was successful, it means they didn\'t complete the security checks from their side.\n\nWe also had a look on the chat, and we have informed you there the chat ended because it appeared you went offline, but we gave you the option to contact us again, and we didn\'t hear from you.\n\nIf you still have questions, please reach us at https://wi.se/contactus_\n\nWise.', 'CompanyReplyDate': '2021-09-30', 'CompanyReplyTime': '09:51:28'}

I tried to get help from customer service and each time got ludicrously irrelevant answers, generally cutting and pasting the instructions for setting up a direct debit.
