Their website says "Please note that we might change the cashback rate in the future - but we\'ll always let you know first". This has not been the case, in fact several places on the website and the app both still have the old cashback rate stated, even though ive complained several times, they dont bother to fix it. Either way if they were to make a change that affects the money in customers pockets, they should ALWAYS email you to tell you, they have not done that, nor have they updated all their T&C with any new lower rates. It is a disaster and all they say is "sorry for the inconvience" in reality they have scammed their customers out of money and should be refunding each and everyone of them, and notifying them of this change that apparently happened 6 weeks ago. It is time for the Financial Ombudsman it seems as they dont want to take responsibility for their mistakes. I never thought i would have an issue with them, and that if i did they would be humble, apologise and fix it, like any trustworthy bank that makes a one off mistake. But their lack of care and their attempts to sweep this under the carpet just show how untransparent and scam like they actually are', 'review_date': '2023-04-06', 'review_time': '23:32:43', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
