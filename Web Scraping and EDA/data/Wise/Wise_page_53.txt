{'platform': 'Wise', 'id': '652001460c1f46f9bde35a74', 'stars': 2, 'title': 'Be prepared to wait a long time for your money, with larger amounts.', 'message': 'I\'ve been using Wise for international transfers for quite some time now, and it\'s usually worked well, until recently.\n\nThe last time round, they decided they wanted to put me through one of their "getting to know our customers" processes, which if you have been through one before, can be a bit annoying - but usually if you get the info together, it works out.\n\nThe big problem that wise have is how they take customers through such a process, and their systems supporting it.\n\nFirstly, you are misled in regards to how long the process could take. My timeline, upon being asked to verify myself during the transfer, went from 1 hour, to 5 days, to 4-10 days. This sends you into almost a panic, as in my case they did this on a large sum of money and usually you get the funds quickly.\n\nOnce you have started the verification process, the information you need to supply is requested, but if you don\'t get it 100% right - then they ask for more or it simply just drags out. When you get some feedback, they don\'t tell you exactly what you need to produce for them or what is missing, so it ends up being quite a long guessing game.\n\nI am located in Europe, and asked support whom seemed to be on a US time zone, but of course it\'s yet another department who works with these things that they have no control over. Over the course of 4 working days and a weekend I discovered that those two departments weren\'t in contact either - as I was getting emails from different people, as well as automated emails, with various requests for information that I had already sent to their colleagues on a link provided - which was very confusing.\n\nSo, if you include a days wait to a process where the left hand doesn\'t know what the right hand is doing, and also an online system that was either different from instructions given or just not working then the days soon tick by.\n\nI\'ve since be in touch with Support, to ask for the transfer fee to be refunded, but their reply was to send me their T&Cs - which I should familiarise myself with I guess..... No mention of all the extra legwork I\'ve had to do because of their glitchy systems and bad instructions, just that I should be aware that they CAN do this.\n\nSo, there you go, be aware - VERY aware that WISE can hold on to your cash until they are satisfied of who you are and how you got that money in the first place.\n\nWhy they don\'t just do a regular getting to know you request I don\'t know, but it seems they flag larger amounts and then go for you in stealth and in depth.\n\nI did get my funds in the end as I had all the source information, but that was 6 days after instead of 1 hour, and I don\'t remember that being the reason I started to use WISE.\n\nOh well, I\'m now going to give Revolut a try now as they can also cater to my kids, but do think it\'s "Wise" to have more than one provider of this kind of service - especially in case of larger amounts.\n\nI wouldn\'t say never use Wise, but always have in mind that they can sit on large amounts of money that isn\'t theirs, and have you run around like a headless chicken. Next time I\'ll try a combination I think - to spread the risk of this happening again.', 'review_date': '2023-10-06', 'review_time': '14:44:54', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
