And you’ll only ever pay for what you use. No asterisks. No small print. No hidden fees.\n\nThe cost of your transfer depends on several factors: the currencies you use, the payment method you choose, and the current market exchange rate. You can find out more about our fees here: https://wi.se/ourfees\n\nWe’ve also introduced a tool that calculates the fees for your transfer, so you can see the cost before you set it up.

What it does poorly, is does very poorly - and unpredictably; it\'s policies seem to shift from day to day, and they are unable to explain it adequately. For example, if you have money in a Wise-US$ account and you want to move to your Wise-Euro account - no problem. Easy, fast, efficient. You can also - in theory - transfer US$ from a non-Wise account, through Wise, to a CDN$ non-Wise account. (Imagine debiting your payroll bank account to send money to a friend). Sometimes it transfers, as they say, in seconds. Sometimes it\'s overnight. Sometimes, it takes up to five days. For the exact same type of transaction. Although the first screen says "it\'ll arrive in seconds", sometimes the final screen says it will take up to five days. To be fair, you do KNOW before you hit OK that there will be a delay, but this is of limited value if you want to transfer money NOW, as they claim to be able to do. But the point is, you can\'t rely on them to apply the same policy, the same way, every time. Unless of course, you want to pay a premium, then they seem to be able to do it as advertised. That is the poor side of Wise and if it weren\'t for the considerable value of a debit card that can be used in multiple currencies, I would absolutely be with a competitor. Too bad really.
