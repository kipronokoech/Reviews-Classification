Sorry to hear you've had a bad experience with us.\n\nWe always tell our customers beforehand how much they'll be paying for their transfer.\nThe only exception for this would be on SWIFT transfers. This is because the extra costs charged are from other banks, not from TransferWise. We never recommend using SWIFT if it can be avoided and we always show a disclaimer about the extra fees whenever setting these type of transfers through us.\n\nIf you'd like for us to take a look at your transfer and see what went wrong, please contact us right; https://wi.se/contactus_\n\nAll the best,\nAndrea\nTransferWise.", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2020-11-18', 'CompanyReplyTime': '12:59:44'}
