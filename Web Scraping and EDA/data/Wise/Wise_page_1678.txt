It's normally a result of a conflict with our Terms of Service or Customer Agreement, or due to a discrepancy with a financial law. We can't share the exact reason of the deactivation, due to how we're regulated. However, you can find some possible reasons here wi.se/accountdeactivation.\n\nAs for your remaining money in your account, we'll work on sending it back to you. But first, we need to carry out due diligence checks. While we do that, your money and information will be safe and secure.\n\nWise", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2022-06-01', 'CompanyReplyTime': '12:52:01'}
