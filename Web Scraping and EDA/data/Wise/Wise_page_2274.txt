As an American living in Colombia, I wanted to deposit funds in my Wise wallet and then convert it to COP.

I spoke with a CSR, and she said I could transfer directly from my back but neglected to mention there's a $30 fee for the privilege. They have a debit card that you have to pay for and if you spend over $100 they charge you every time you use it.
