We only ever close accounts that are being used in a way that goes against our Terms of Use: https://wi.se/customeragreement\n\nIf you think we‚Äôve made a mistake, you can follow these guidelines to appeal our decision: https://wi.se/accountdeactivation. We‚Äôll review your request and get back to you ASAP via email.\n\nWe'll work on sending the remaining money in your account back to you. But first, we need to carry out due diligence checks. While we do that, your money and information stays safe and secure.\n\nTo clarify, we'll never ask you to send us money when we deactivate your account, nor to issue you a refund.\n\nIf you've received a message from us requesting you to send money to get a refund, it's likely that you've fallen victim to a phishing scam ‚Äì a type of online fraud. It‚Äôs where scammers try to convince you to hand over your personal details by posing as a legitimate and trusted company, usually by email.\n\nThe email they send will look very similar to the company‚Äôs legitimate emails ‚Äì they‚Äôll copy the logo, colour scheme and typeface of the company. And they‚Äôll usually say that something has happened to your account, for example, that it‚Äôs been deactivated or that you‚Äôve won a prize.\n\nThey‚Äôll then ask you to log in, or send money to fix this problem. These log in pages may look similar to the real thing, but it‚Äôs important that you don‚Äôt log in, click any links, or send them money.\n\nWhen you spot something like this, please reach out to us at https://wi.se/contactus or on Twitter, Facebook, or Instagram.\n\nWise", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2023-09-20', 'CompanyReplyTime': '11:24:50'}

This is verification for someone who has used Wise for lots of stuff over years. When I enquired with their customer services why this was needed, I was told only my identity had been ‚Äòverified‚Äô when the account was set up, but apparently I had not been ‚Äòverified‚Äô to receive money ‚Ä¶.I was shocked but also annoyed because other family members who I had sent money to previously had never been asked for separate ‚Äòverification‚Äô to qualify them to receive money. No satisfactory explanation was provided for this. As it was the situation happened while I was at home, thank goodness, not at an airport needing the money to buy a ticket, or any other urgent situation.\nThe bottom line for me now is that, yes, Wise is great, convenient, useful etc‚Ä¶until it isn‚Äôt.
