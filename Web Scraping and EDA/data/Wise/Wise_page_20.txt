Two weeks ago, I initiated a transfer to one of the missionaries in England to whom we had sent funds several times. This was a larger amount than their normal monthly support which is normally around $4,000. This transfer was $32,000 because they were moving from a rental flat to a home and these funds were to help pay for a house-hunting trip to Scotland, where they have been called to pastor, and provide funds toward a down payment. Wise held the transfer and asked for some documents (3 months of our church\'s bank statements) which I promptly uploaded. They promptly had the funds withdrawn from our church bank account, but it took them 5 days to "review the documents", and they then asked for copies of some contribution receipts, which I promptly uploaded. It\'s been several days, and they still have not reviewed these additional documents nor have they released the funds. I could cancel the transfer, but I am told it could take 5-10 days for the funds to be returned to our church\'s account. Their failure to process things on a timely basis has really caused some issues. Next I will be contacting our state Securities Commission and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, but I wanted to warn other potential users of the troubles they might encounter using Wise. Addition: It\'s now been another week, and Wise still hasn\'t seen fit to have anyone review the additional documents they had me submit. They still have over $30k of our money locked up for no good reason.
