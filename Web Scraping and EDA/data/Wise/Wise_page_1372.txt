On his wise account the transaction status said "error occured: unable to complete transaction". Seeing this and waiting about a week, no money was taken from his account. We guessed as much that it was unsuccessful as the previous four attempts were. We had blocked the receiver of the money on all social media as they actually had no right to ask for the money after all this time. (We didn\'t actually owe them, they\'re just going back on their word)\n\nCut to 9 weeks later, we get a rather threatening email saying that we owed th money and if we didn\'t pay, they\'d send a debt collector and take legal action. Firstly, please note that this is the FIRST we had heard of this. It\'s not like we received previous warnings. Secondly, why would we owe them money when the transaction never went through?\n\nTurns out, their system ridiculously sendsmoney to the recipient and only THEN takes it out of the sender\'s account. I cannot stress how inefficient, incompetent and just plain stupid that is!\n\nSo the error occurred as mentioned in wise is that my fiance bank wouldn\'t release theoney to wise, an unknown account. I don\'t understand what kind of money transfer service sends out money before it is first received. Utterly stupid!\n\nIt took my fiance and I a long time to get the money together to pay them as we spent the money intended to be transferred: thinking it didn\'t go through. We had to borrow from friends since we were given no grace or apology by this company for THEIR mistake and they threaten legal action. It was incredibly unfair. Unless you know EXACTLY what you\'re doing, don\'t use this service. Just pay a little more for an online bank transfer or wire.', 'review_date': '2022-07-22', 'review_time': '02:38:13', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
