I don’t understand why policies would change that would adversely impact regular, lucrative customers. I have offered no risk to Wise and my transfers should not be slowed down in any way.\n\nEdited to respond to reply: Your company changed its operational practices regarding transfers and pre-funding them if an ACH payment was being used. In the past you could do a US to UK transfer in seconds. They money would appear in your UK account almost instantly. It may take a few days for the ACH payment to actually draft from the US account, but you had your UK funds immediately. Since you guys made your unacknowledged changes, you now wait for the US ACH payment to actually clear which may take several days before you make the transfer in the UK. It’s a huge difference and the fact that your company continues to respond with canned replies (including to Trust Pilot) which won’t admit to a change in your business practice makes me irate.', 'review_date': '2022-09-23', 'review_time': '11:49:50', 'CompanyReply': 'Reply from Wise\nSep 23, 2022\nHello!\n\nWe aim to complete all transfers as fast as possible, but delays can happen for different reasons.

Transaction was confirmed by website and shown to be in progress when I set it up on June 5, and I didn\'t receive any email notifications that something was wrong. Again today June 8, Wise claims transaction is in progress, but the money hasn\'t left my US bank account, so how can it be in progress? I don\'t trust that the money is being transferred since it didn\'t already happen although Wise said it was in progress. This is delaying my receiving the money so I have to borrow from family members.
