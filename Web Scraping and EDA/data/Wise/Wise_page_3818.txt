They had asked that I use Transferwise. I signed up, provided copy of my passport etc and then booked the payment. I then arranged payment by debit card to Transferwise. I received no email confirmation but the deal appeared in my online account.\nThe next day I checked the account to ensure that payment had arrived in India only to see the account marked as 'Deactivated' - no explanation and no email was ever received telling me the account was deactivated nor that the payment had not been made.\nI phoned Transferwise and got no satisfaction having spent ages on the phone. I was told to make an appeal online. This involved submitting a photograph of me, a second photograph of my passport and a photograph of me holding my passport which I did.\nI then received an email telling me the account was to remain deactivated and if I was not happy with this I should go through the very appeals process online which I had just gone through.\nI have since received a further email telling me that the account (which I no longer want) will not be re-activated. This was, like most emails from Transferwise, from an noreply email. They insisted that they could give me no reason whatsoever why they had deactivated my account.\nAs soon as I found out that the account had been deactivated I contacted another money transfer service, opened an account and the money was sent. The whole process took less than half an hour and was as good and smooth as one could possibly ask for. I even received a phone call later from this company asking me if everything was OK and I was satisfied with the service since it was my first transaction.\nIn my view Transferwise represent all that is bad about arrogant, inefficient online businesses who treat their customers with contempt. Their communication were nothing short of insulting.\nI am not a drug dealer, a money launderer. I was not trying to send huge amount of dollars to or from Columbia or Afghanistan.\nAll I wanted to do was to send $50 to a friend in India.\nTRANSFERWISE - AVOID - there are much better money transfer services.", 'review_date': '2020-11-16', 'review_time': '13:27:37', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nNov 17, 2020\nHello there and thank you for your message. We're really sorry to hear about your account.\n\nYou should know we don't take account deactivation lightly at TransferWise.
