I have found the support very helpful and quick to respond too. Who knew it would be so much easier to speak to a human at an online bank than one that actually has branches!\nThe four star rating rather than 5 star is because the website needs some improvement in terms of simplifying the user experience - it can take quite a while how to do things like work out how to create a bank statement. Also I don't know how to arrange standing orders/direct debits, or even if I can, so this is territory yet to be negotiated.\nOverall though I'm really pleased with everything and would highly recommend.", 'review_date': '2021-07-05', 'review_time': '09:45:09', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
