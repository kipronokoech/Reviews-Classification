It could be because the transfer was set up closer to the weekend/holidays, or because we needed to carry extra checks.

Used the service for a couple of months. On February 14 my account was blocked without any explanation.

Of course, the appeals department did not respond to several of my email asking why my account was blocked and demanding my money back. And that's it. The end. The account is blocked, there is no answer to letters for more than a month.\n\nI think this is a FRAUDULENT scheme based on the fact that no one will entrust a lot of money to such an unknown service without an address and phone number on the site, and if a small amount is blocked, they may not go to court.\n\nYou use the service until you have accumulated a certain amount on your account, after which your account is blocked and there is no connection with the service - they do not respond to letters. The only way to get a response is to post a review. I wonder if this will be of any use in returning the money.\n\nI hope my review will stop potential WISE users and give current users a good idea to withdraw their money while they can and close the account.", 'review_date': '2023-03-20', 'review_time': '14:56:12', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nMar 20, 2023\nHey, Nikolay\n\nSorry to hear your account was deactivated.

Avoid.\n\nA follow up on my earlier experience, I defied my own recommendation and gave Wise another go...big mistake. Again I was fully compliant and have sent them everything they requested and more. In fact about the only personal detail they don\'t have of me is a blood sample!!! This morning I received an email stating the money I transferred to them had been received and would be in my bank account "...it should be there today, March 19."\n\nI went to log on and find my message stating "Your account has been deactivated". Apparently I can appeal the decision and am told it may take some days. So I follow the link and do the appeal and get an immediate response of "After reviewing your case we\'ve decided to keep your account closed."\n\nI have checked the agreement to see what could have caused this.

We may at any time suspend or close your Wise Account and/or end this Agreement without notice if:\n\n(a) you breach any provision of this Agreement or documents referred to in this Agreement;\n\n(b) we are requested or directed to do so by any competent court of law, government authority, public agency, or law enforcement agency;\n\n(c) we have reason to believe you are in breach of any applicable law or regulation; or\n\n(d) we have reason to believe you are involved in any fraudulent activity, money laundering, terrorism financing or other criminal or illegal activity.\n\nNone of the above are applicable.\n\nWise service is very poor. This is my third payment attempt. One was successful and the other two have been cancelled by Wise and now deactivated.\n\nDo not trust these people - I have had no assurance around their privacy policy and they now hold a life time of personal data about me. They unilaterally deactivated my account and now I have little choice but to either write off the experience, or spend time writing to the relevant office (Financial Ombudsman Office?) to complain.
