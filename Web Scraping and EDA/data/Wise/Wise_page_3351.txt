As with all the reviews I have read, they claim a due diligence period of 60 working days, i.e. 3 months, in order to comply with their legal obligation, which is totally unrealistic and unjustified for a due diligence!!!!\nAs for everyone else they closed our account without respecting the legal 2 months notice which applies to all financial institutions regulated by the FCA.\n\nDespite several emails they continue to provide the same more or less standardised response without any justification or request from their compliance department.\n\n\nI have noticed on Trustpilot and other rating websites that many other people or companies have significant funds blocked by Wise, I setup contactwcase at gmail.com so that people who wish to take collective action with lawyers and contact the FCA in the UK and the AMF in France, to inform them of these dubious practices, can contact me so that we can help each other and put an end to these practices.I am calling on Deeps, Alex Pacific, Alexandre Asher and all the others to share our experiences and see what we can do together. I work with a very large law firm in London which has a financial department specialising in this type of litigation with a very efficient partner, I have seen in some reviews that there are also companies specialising in the recovery of funds in this type of case, if you have already used their service please give us your feedback and how to proceed.\n\nI promise to keep my review up to date with the progress of my case and the information I receive\n\nMessage to Wise:\nI will not stop posting until I have recovered the funds of our company.\nYou have all my contact details thanks to contact me', 'review_date': '2021-04-20', 'review_time': '15:34:43', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
