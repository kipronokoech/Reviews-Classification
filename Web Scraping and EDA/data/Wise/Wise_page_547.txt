Uploaded all the possible documents needed to verify that my dad is my dad and he is sponsoring my life at this moment. But in a few days my account was just blocked for no reason. I did not even receive an email explaining what is the reason behind such a decision. I have simply had an email that my transfer is canceled and the next time i opened my app it simply did not open and displayed me the massage "YOUR ACCOUNT IS BLOCKED". I made an appeal but i have no other means of survival here in Bulgaria I can not wait for 30 days especially because there are no reason for blocking my account that is my family money and you cannot just block me whenever you want. If you believe that there is something wrong with the transfer then you should ask me for documents and i will provide you with every single proof that you need but it is not in your power to simply decide whether i will eat today or not. I hope you will pass this message onto the right team and deal with my case immediately. Thank you Kind Regards\n\nAfter more than a month they decided to unblock without even saying sorry. it happened on 27 january. However they blocked me again on the 31 of january and said that i would have to wait for another 30 days.\n\nTo be honest i dont even know what to say. The same person the same money a did not do anything i did not send any additional money to Wise. I am not connected to crypto or anything else. I simply paid for a few items at IKEA and send 4000$ to my own account in Israel from WISE due to the fact that after the first block i dont feel save keeping all my money in WISE. And i was right because I got blocked for the second time. No reason no explanation. I loved this part of their email:\n\n"Just because we can’t offer you our services going forward doesn’t mean that we think your activities are illegal or illegitimate — it just means that we don’t support those types of activities."\n\nWhat activities ? Paying for my morning coffee. Buying chair in IKEA or sending my own money to my own bank account?\n\n\nGreat service, great company, I have nothing else to say', 'review_date': '2023-02-01', 'review_time': '13:01:55', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

I love it that they don't get charged any fee just to pay my invoices. I simply can't get over how fast Wise is, and how easy to use. And it has been 100% reliable - the reason I sought out Wise in the first place was because the Irish bank I was using LOST A TRANSFER OF €5,000. I eventually got it back, but it was scary, and I knew I would never trust the regular banking system again. I have clients who pay in EUR and GBP, which I then convert to USD when I transfer it to my business account, and it is seamless from end to end. Rather than saving up a chunk of money to wire all at once to save on exorbitant wiring fees, I move my money invoice by invoice - that makes tax accounting super easy and transparent. The detail that Wise provides on each transaction receipt makes it easy for me to do a split in Quickbooks to account for the (tiny) transaction fee. Wise, please do not stop and do not change - you are working perfectly for me!", 'review_date': '2022-12-22', 'review_time': '21:05:54', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
