If that's the case, we do hold different accounts, and you won't always send the money to the same bank account details. It's very important that when sending money with us, you first create a transfer order on your Wise account, and then you send us the money to the account details we share with you on the screen. By not having only one account, we also make sure people aren't saving our account details, and send us money without creating a transfer order first.\n\nWe hope this clarifies a bit.\n\nWise.", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2021-10-28', 'CompanyReplyTime': '12:55:44'}
