The transfer did not go through and instead of looking into it the cause, they kept blaming my bank.\n\nI don't think the bank was the issue as I have used the same account to transfer funds before.\n\nWhen Wise acquired the business it went downhill. Previously the customer service actually looked into the back end and identified the source of the problem and then instructed on how to set up something differently.\n\nI use only use this rarely out of necessity. I am going to look for a different company now because anytime a company is blaming the customer without any detailed explanation of where a transfer went wrong, you know it's a lame canned response.", 'review_date': '2022-12-17', 'review_time': '16:48:33', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nUpdated Dec 21, 2022\nHi Varad,\n\nWe appreciate you take the time to share this feedback.

However, the Support Team have no influence over the Payments Team who are the ones who actually do the processing and who specify what verification information is required.\n\nThe Support Team are not in the same location as the Payments Team, probably working from home. One member of the Support Team told me that they can’t even telephone the Payments Team. All they can do is send and receive emails. This means that the communication is second hand and you’re given incorrect information about the status of your transfer. I was assured by the Support Team on more than one occasion that I had provided all the necessary information for the transfer to proceed, only to find out later that this wasn’t true. And if the Payments Team don’t respond to emails, the Support Team can’t do anything about it and they wind up in the position of having made false promises to the customer. This is the basic flaw in their operation. I almost felt sorry for them.\n\nAnyway, I have set out below the series of events surrounding my transfer so that if you are a potential new customer you can judge for yourself whether you wish to risk your money with this organisation.\n\n21 November: I set up a new Wise account. I submitted personal ID, as requested, and details of the transfer. I also provided funds for the transfer by sending money to Wise from my bank current account. I received an automated email confirming that my verification documents had been received. But my account showed the transfer as ‘paused’ pending verification.\n\n25 November: I sent a website message asking when the transfer would be processed.\n\n25 November: Email from Rachel saying “your Wise profile has been verified and everything is ready for you to start making payments”. Transfer still paused. I emailed back asking when the transfer would be processed.\n\n28 November: Email from Dipen Bhowmick asking for bank statements.\n\n28 November: Dipen’s email was confused and made no sense so I telephoned the Wise helpline. I was asked for personal information about the transfer recipients, which I provided. I was told that Wise now had all the necessary information and that the transfer would be expedited.\n\n2 December: Transfer still paused. I sent a website message asking when the transfer would be processed.\n\n3 December: Email from Jay Tine saying he will follow-up the transfer with the payments team.\n\n6 December: Transfer still paused. I telephoned the Wise helpline and spoke to Annabelle M. She said the transfer would be expedited.\n\n6 December: Email from Annabelle M confirming that all necessary information had been provided and that she would follow-up the transfer with the payments team. She assured me that the transfer would be within 1-2 days.\n\n8 December: Transfer still paused. I sent a website message asking when the transfer would be processed.\n\n10 December: Email from Reg saying the issue had been escalated. The support team was still awaiting a response but this was expected in up to 2 working days.\n\n13 December: Transfer still paused. I sent a website message asking when the transfer would be processed.\n\n13 December: Email from Josiah saying that “one more document” was needed to process the transfer, namely a copy of my bank statement, thus contradicting previous assurances that all necessary information had been provided. I sent back a statement showing the transfer of funds from my current account to Wise on 21 November.\n\n15 December: Transfer still paused. I sent a website message asking for the transfer to be processed immediately or for the funds to be returned to my bank current account.\n\n16 December: Email informing that the transfer had been completed. On the same day, I received another email inviting me to recommend Wise to my friends. Somehow I don’t think I’ll be doing that.', 'review_date': '2022-12-17', 'review_time': '15:32:42', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
