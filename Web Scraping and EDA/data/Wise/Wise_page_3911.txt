Account deactivation isn't something we take lightly. It can be a result of a conflict with our ToS or a discrepancy with financial law. We know this can be very frustrating that we can't tell you why it's how the law works.\n\nWe explain that in more detail here: wi.se/safe\n\nIf you still have money in your TransferWise balances when we close your account, we'll work on sending it back to your bank account. But first, we need to carry out due diligence checks. While we do that, your money and information will be safe and secure.\n\nReaching out to our appeals team is the way to go as we from the customer support side can't see your account details anymore. They will get back to you within 10 business days with more details, so make sure to keep an eye on your emails.\n\nThanks\n\nJoao", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2020-10-28', 'CompanyReplyTime': '14:10:20'}

Seriously?? For not even £300 I need wait? Why? I didn't have this issue before, did they know the issue that this cost me at that moment? And is not for the amount is because I was 100%sure to trust that everything wil be OK, so now I need to wait and pay from my pocket this issue which I was not expecting and at this current times is more difficult, I'm very disappointed, I will keep this post updated on when the money will rich my account.\n\nThis an updated review about my issue, thanks Joao for your reply, but I'm disagree about your response, you mentioned that depends of the currency! It was made in Pounds from a local bank in England, the time! Was made around 1pm, so this is not a excuse cause I made this kind of transactions in a recent past and always was inmediately, even the local banks have inmediat transfers, and for Transferwise took 2 days for a transfer of a very small amount!!!

At the same time, I transferred a sum from UK to Spain, which took 3 hours. With the considerable higher commission they take for Norwegian transfers,you would hope you got some decent service.\nService from Norway has really gone downhill with their change of bank recently.\nI would give them 3 or 4 stars from UK,but only 1 from Norway, thus will not use them in future.\nCustomer service is quick to respond by email, however they have no care for customers unfortunately. And very little knowledge of Norwegian banking,simply banging on about Norwegian transfers takes sooo very long to come through.\nRegretfully, in my view, they are turning into a mainstream bank, where numbers and profit is the game, not individuals.', 'review_date': '2020-10-27', 'review_time': '16:24:52', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nOct 28, 2020\nHi Svein.
