We carry out verification checks, and these checks may increase the time it takes to process your transfer order. We cannot be responsible for any delays as a result of carrying out those checks.”\n\nSpeed is always our priority, but so is diligence. Depending on the case, it can take from hours to several days. Do keep in mind, we always make sure to update you along the way, and you’ll know the status of your transfer at all times.\n\nWe truly appreciate your patience.\n\nWise', 'CompanyReplyDate': '2022-12-06', 'CompanyReplyTime': '16:22:46'}
