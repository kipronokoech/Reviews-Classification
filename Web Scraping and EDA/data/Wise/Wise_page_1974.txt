And they have been excellent. I have never had a problem in selecting the transfer, and having my money in the location of choice (typically from Europe to the UK).\n\nPart of the reason I like Wise is because they guarantee a rate for a period, typically 15 - 17 hours, sometimes more.\n\nMy recent experience with them is a guaranteed rate for a period of time that is impossible to meet, unless you initiate the transfer request late at night. In my case, I would needed to have initiated the transfer to ensure the guaranteed rate at around 11pm in the evening.\n\nI was given a little over 13 hours for the guaranteed rate to be honored. What I got instead was a mid rate market rate. So based on my initial request and at the rate I saw, I lost some money. I appreciate Wise is a business and cannot guarantee rates indefinitely, otherwise they would lose money, but a period that is more or less impossible to achieve seems underhanded and almost false advertising.\n\nBy no means am I saying people should not use Wise - they have been excellent for me, and I will continue to use them (as compared to other international transfer organisations), but I would warn people to check the guaranteed period you are offer so you are not surprised when you receive your money.\n\n**EDIT\nWith the knowledge of the limited transfer rate times I selected a rate late at night and was guaranteed a rate for nearly 24 hours. Brilliant I thought. My bank transferred the money 1st thing in the morning leaving a good 3 hours for Wise to complete the transaction. 5 hours later the money was transferred. Giving me…mid market rate. I am beginning to lose trust in Wise when transfers of this nature should not take 5 or more hours once they have received the money.', 'review_date': '2022-05-02', 'review_time': '06:13:24', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nMay 10, 2022\nHello there,\n\nEvery currency has a different guaranteed rate period. For example, for GBP the guaranteed rate is only 2 hours, because most GBP payments reach us within this time frame. For EUR, the guaranteed rate is 48 hours, so it depends on the currency you're sending.\n\nKeep in mind that when you set up your transfer, we share with you the exact time in which we need to receive your money in order to follow up with the guaranteed rate offered.\n\nWe recommend avoiding setting up transfers and sending us payments during the evening, as banks are not processing payments then, but the guaranteed rate period is already counting from the moment you set up the transfer under your Wise account.\n\nWise.", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2022-05-10', 'CompanyReplyTime': '09:10:36'}
