Transferring/sending money from Wise - supposedly Wise's strong point - can have its frustrations, though.\n\nThere are a number of IBAN's to which Wise simply refuses to send money, ostensibly because of some dodginess. Among these, however, is an account for a European national tax authority that our business needs to pay regularly. We are simply unable to do it with Wise. Contacting Wise customer service is pointless. They won't budge or look into it. I've also experienced this personally for an investment account and the occasional merchant. A concrete reason is never given.\n\nThe issue is not that an IBAN might end up on a black list, but rather when a customer can demonstrate that the classification was incorrect (e.g. a national tax authority), Wise should be flexible enough to investigate and reclassify, or at least provide a suitable reason.\n\nBecause of this and other occasional minor issues (e.g. transfers not being sent on the day indicated but delayed to the next day) we've come to regard Wise as a useful secondary tool, but not a consistently dependable one.", 'review_date': '2021-08-16', 'review_time': '10:47:48', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nAug 25, 2021\nHey there,\n\nWe do our best to offer you the best experience possible, but because of the way we're regulated, there are certain accounts/type of payments, we can't support.
