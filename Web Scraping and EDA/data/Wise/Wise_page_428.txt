I rely on them and have been for nearly five years. The problem is that their frugality comes at a cost. They routinely delay my transfers, like my salary from my employer. The money I pay rent with and survive on, Sometimes the delay is for weeks. Wise, you cannot bluff me and say it's for my 'safety and security' when a traditional bank transfers the same money within hours. And it is always up to me to call them when my salary is blocked. I work for a Fortune 10 company. There's zero risk here. Wise will never call— they use 'fraud and security' to make you feel guilty and to hold your money. I used to love them when they were TransferWise. Fun fact: Years ago, they accidentally sent me thousands of dollars.Something you only read about, right? Of course, as soon as I noticed, I sent it right back. I operate with integrity; why treat me otherwise? The story's moral: Wise has become so distrusting of 'users' (a.k.a. people) that they trash the customer experience. I now use InstaRem, which is also problematic; transfers take a few more hours, but they are sometimes cheaper, especially when paying with Visa or Mastercard. Wise has spent a fortune rebranding from blue to green. Clearly, someone at the company cares. But this someone is not influencing the day-to-day customer experience. Wise is no longer a brand I love—an absolute shame.", 'review_date': '2023-03-29', 'review_time': '09:57:46', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
