I\'ve exchanged probably 7 to 8 emails with the support team. Each time, I have to send them a reminder myself that I am waiting for an answer. Then the answer comes and they ask me to send an additional document. People reading emails also don\'t understand business status in my country and they keep on asking me questions about it, so I end up actually having to teach them so that I can move forward (but not really because I have to wait a week, send them a reminder, to have them ask me another question)\nI used to love using Wise for many years, but now there is no customer service. You might think why has she not tried chat: I tried many times and it rarely works, despite trying at different times.\n\nDo yourself a favor before you get payments set up to wise, and consider other companies that provide the exact same service.\n\nEdit: Thank you for your response below, but as I said, I provided all the information requested: proof of adress, proof of ID. You are right, change of adress should not take long and right now it\'s been 2 months and customer service has not been responding to my mails for the past 3 weeks.

Our goal is to be eventually free.\n\nThere are different pricings depending on how you pay. The fast transfer/card payment is going to be the highest fee for most currencies. Other options such as bank transfer or bank debits are typically more cost efficient.\n\nHopefully it will be better for you on your next transfer.

Money gets transferred on time. Before I used money transfer service from bank but that is too time consuming and not professional.\nWise is clear :- You know how much money the receiver will receive and they receive exactly that much money. No drama\nWise is economical :- Minimum charges and best possible live rate\nWise is Fast :- Almost all my transfers get processed with in 24 hours. That is due to bank transfer option and how fast the bank send money to Wise. There is option of credit card, where the charges are little more but transfer is done instantly\nSo Wise is wise decision ... Review from a Delighted customer.
