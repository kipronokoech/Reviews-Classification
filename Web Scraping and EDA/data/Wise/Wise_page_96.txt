Even after providing all the documents they requested to prove my funds’ legitimacy, my account stayed locked, and Wise failed to offer any warning or satisfactory explanation for this action.\nWhen I reached out to their customer service for help, all I received were automated responses that did nothing to shed light on the situation.
