However, a guaranteed rate is an exchange rate that’s guaranteed for a specified period of time. As long as we receive your money on time, you’ll get that rate locked.\n\nWe always work on verifying your documents ASAP, but in some cases, for example if there's a mismatch between names, we might need to ask some additional documents. The transfer resumes automatically once the document is approved.\n\nIf we can't accept a document, we typically email you and ask you to upload additional ones. We'd recommend keeping an eye on your inbox when you have an ongoing transfer.\n\nWe appreciate you taking your time to give us feedback.
