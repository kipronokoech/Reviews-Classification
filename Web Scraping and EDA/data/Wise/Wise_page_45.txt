If you’re using a different currency, the sum will be equivalent to the currency your card was issued in.\n\nYou get 2 free withdrawals per calendar month. From the third withdrawal, we’ll charge you the fixed fee applicable in your issuance region, regardless of how much money you've withdrawn that month.

Which is why we charge as little as possible – and why we’re always looking for ways to make that number smaller.\n\nHowever, markets have been more volatile lately, which has made it more expensive for us to buy and sell currencies. This means we’ve had to raise our fees to cover those costs.\n\nIn regard to the exchange rate – when we convert money, we do it using the mid-market exchange rate. We get this rate from Reuters – and they update it in real-time, during the trading market opening hours. You can read more here: https://wise.com/gb/mid-market-rate\n\nAs a regulated financial institution, we don't do random account lockouts. If you're referring to deactivations, this is often a result of a conflict with our Terms of Service or Customer Agreement, or due to a discrepancy with a financial law.\n\nIf you have any questions, please reach out to us at: https://wi.se/contactus, or send us a private message on X (Twitter), Facebook, or Instagram with your email and user number. We'll gladly help you.\n\nWise", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2023-10-12', 'CompanyReplyTime': '08:30:36'}

As a freelancer working with clients all over the world, in different currencies, it used to be nightmarish to manage my payments. Worse, I had to convert immediately upon payment, no matter the exchange rate, meaning I often lost a lot of money simply by getting paid.\nI also love using the Wise card and pay for everything directly in my homebase country's currency, without having to worry about daily conversion rates.\n\nThey definitely can improve on a lot of details. The app doesn't feel very robust in terms of security, and getting things like bank statements for taxes is a little bit annoying since you have to get one for each account, in a very manual and painstaking way. Some preset PDFs by month would help a lot, and this isn't hard for them to do.\n\nBut I'm bullish on this service and happy I've been using it for years.", 'review_date': '2023-10-11', 'review_time': '18:30:47', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nOct 13, 2023\nHello,\n\nWe believe our customers deserve the best, and we're glad to see that you're enjoying our services.
