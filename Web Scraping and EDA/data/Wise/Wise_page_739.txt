Usually to buy a Amazon voucher for new baby/wedding/leaving etc for a member of the team.\n\nThis time, I put a ref \'Gift Abdul\' and Wise\'s ultra sensitive (racist much) compliance/sanction algorithm flagged it as being suspect and asked for name, DoB, address, reason for payment etc. which I duly delivered.\n\nThis still wasn\'t enough for Wise as they asked multiple times and I gave multiple times. On the 4th try, I mentioned I work in payments for a large US bank and asked why is this a problem now and why the delay after giving the information.\n\nWise\'s response? Cancelled the payment.\n\nOk Wise, you use my companies payment rails so can\'t see how myself or the team are on your \'potential sanctions\' list. I used PayPal as an alternative and they sent the payment in 13min.\n\nWise, you are pathetic.\n\nIn reply to Wise\'s reply: You rolled out the "We have to do checks as per the regulators" rather than respond to the specific concerns as to why it was cancelled after providing the req info.
