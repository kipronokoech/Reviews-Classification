Then I started using the card for online purchases. I bought flights with the Wise and I was double charged. The second charge was two days after the first and was done without my permission obviously. It took about two weeks to get a refund. No big deal you might think. Then I couldn't add any funds to my account as Wise decided not to accept my regular bank debit card. I tried sending emails asking for help but they kept saying it was my banks problem. It obviously wasn't because I opened a Revolut account and used my regular bank debit card to add funds no problem. So I stopped using Wise except for an automatic Spotify payment, which Wise then stopped paying even though I still had money in my account. Then they started pestering me for identity verification although I had provided it several times before. Driver's license not accepted anymore, they said. So I sent my public services card. Not enough they said. They wanted a photo of my passport. I said No. They blocked my account. They asked for an IBAN to send me my money and deactivate my account. I said Great, send it to my Revolut account. No answer from Wise.", 'review_date': '2023-09-27', 'review_time': '22:30:26', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
