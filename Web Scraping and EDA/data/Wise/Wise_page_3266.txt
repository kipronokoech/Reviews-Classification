Brutal and has caused me to look to never use this company again. Unless I have to.\n\nI\'m a long-time customer with a quite few transactions completed across multiple countries and currencies. I also recently opened a Transferwise Debit Card.\n\nI made a simple transfer from my own account in the US to my own account in Canada. I have made this transfer before - this is not the first time. Because the amount was larger than previous transfers I elected to wire the funds to Transferwise. That\'s when all logic, convenience and common sense were completely removed.\n\nI logged on to check on the transfer and was asked to provide proof that I owned my own US account. I have used this account for EVERY transaction with Transferwise I have ever done over the years. I also used this account to open my Debit card - about a month ago - which they verified then too.\n\nI tried to upload the pdf 20 times but the website rejected the very pdf they were asking for. Then I had to contact "Chat" to work that out. That\'s when the idiocy really began.\n\nAfter waiting 4x longer than was quoted I got on with what I believe is an "offshore" customer service rep. The experience was one of the most frustrating and painful customer service experiences I\'ve had in a very long time. This wonderful example of brain-power asked me for documents that contained extremely personal information (full bank statements etc.). Again, this for a long time customer who has used this very same sending account for YEARS, and the very same transfer was made a week before. Then I was asked for screenshots of my account . WHAT??? After an hour, yes, an hour, trying to provide what this person wanted I was told someone would get back to me in 1-2 days. 1-2 days? Are you kidding me? The transfer was already delayed by a day and now you want 2 days more?\nPerhaps Transferwise is good at small, routine transfers. But you\'d better PRAY to whatever God you believe in that you don\'t have to deal with their reps. The company completely fails at this. Absolute misery.\nThis has caused me to decide NEVER to use this company unless there is no alternative.\nGoodbye, Transferwise (Wise).
