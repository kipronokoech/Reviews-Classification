My business name is Luxsoft Dev LLC.\n\nIt‚Äôs been over 6 months now since my transterwise account has been closed. I have a balance of 30,000$ on my account when my account was closed.\n\nTransferwise told me 3 months ago my balance was returned to the sending bank. It‚Äôs been over 3 months now and the sender still didn‚Äôt receive the money back.\n\nI have asked for a confirmation of the funds being sent back and tranferwise has still not been able to provide me with one. If the funds were really sent back why is it taking transferwise 3 months to sending me a confirmation.\n\nI believe transferwise is trying to steal my money. I have waited for 6 months and demanded my balance transferred to me ASAP.\n\nMy business has called apart because of transferwise and this is unacceptable.', 'review_date': '2021-01-26', 'review_time': '22:52:27', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nFeb 2, 2021\nHi there,\nWe're sorry to hear about your experience.\n\nYou can be sure that we'll never close any accounts for no strong reason.

They said that money already sent (not mean transaction delay) but i sent to them bank statements to show it not come. They just said wait and wait, i call them almost everyday, email also everyday but nobody care and unhelpful.\nIs it good service? And professional?\nThey don‚Äôt even have a reasonable to explain why money is delayed, nothing !

Every currency has its own moving speed and it also depends on the receiving bank, how fast the funds would be credited.\n\nSometimes receiving banks also have their own internal checks and procedures. From our side, we can't track nor advise on that. However, we're always here to help and investigate any troubles from our end.\n\nLooks like we've contacted our partner bank to get some better answers on the wait.

I live in the E.U but have an account in Scotland. If someone wants to transfer money to me, they can simply deposit the amount into my Scottish account and within seconds TransferWise can convert the amount into euros and deposit it into the local bank account. It has made my life so much easier and takes away much of the hassle created by other means of currency exchange. The transfer fee is also very low making it the only service I will ever use for currency transfer. I would highly recommend using TransferWise if you have accounts in different countries and need a quick and cheap way to transfer that you can fully trust. Likewise, you can also store a variety of currencies within TransferWise which is incredibly useful when you need somewhere to store a specific currency that you don't wish to keep in cash form but wish to have at your disposal should you need it.", 'review_date': '2021-01-26', 'review_time': '15:29:37', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
