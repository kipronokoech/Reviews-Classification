We're a financial institution, so we need to know who’s using our service, why they’re using it, and that their money comes from a legitimate place. It helps us combat money laundering, and keep everyone’s money safe. That way we can keep providing you even faster, cheaper and more transparent service.\n\nThat's not all – we also have different regulatory requirements in different regions. Because of this, we might need to ask more, or different, questions, depending on where you move money to or from, or where you live.\n\nWe know this is personal information. So we try to ask you the least we can, to still complete all the checks. We always store your information securely, in line with our privacy policy. You can check it here: https://wi.se/privacy_others\n\nTo sum it up, we're here for you and your money, but we want to do it safely and securely.\n\nWise", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2023-04-03', 'CompanyReplyTime': '13:08:04'}
