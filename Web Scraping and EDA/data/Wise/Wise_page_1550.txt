First of all to mention that this review is for the online bank not for money transfer company not sure whether they are separate or together. Customer service is incompetent and rude they don‚Äôt even try to listen to your issue. When request it that I need to speak to supervisor they put the phone down. Wise froze my friend‚Äôs bank account with over thousand pound in there. My friend doesn‚Äôt speak English so I was assisting on the phone. They weren‚Äôt able even to connect us with a Spanish translator by requested for an appointment. All they said you can appeal your case and see what happens. My question is how does she survive with no funds in city like London. She can‚Äôt pay her rent, her phone or internet so doesn‚Äôt have access to online system to appeal. Everything was stopped as a consequence of them frizzing the account and holding her money. Please be aware of this bank. I urge you protect your money and don‚Äôt use them even if they are your only option because one day your money will disappear .', 'review_date': '2022-06-20', 'review_time': '19:37:03', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

I was introduced to Wise a few years ago when they were still called Transferwise and I wanted to move money internationally without my bank taking a huge cut. First time I was very unsure about way the transfer worked and the whole thing seemed very odd but a friend used before and said it was safe so I tried it, and they were really fast and cheap. I ended up using them a few times more after that and there was never any issue. But now they seem to be functioning more like an actual bank and so far I have only had good experiences with the new services. They now also have an app and a much better website than before. For the moment at least they are more convenient and much cheaper than my actual bank.', 'review_date': '2022-06-20', 'review_time': '18:38:29', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
