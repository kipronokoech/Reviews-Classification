Make sure to check how long your transfer to their account takes.', 'message': "Update: So it turns out they do have customer support and that they are reasonable people. I would still personally appreciate the contact info being more readily available on their site, but perhaps that's just me.\n\nBiggest letdown of using Transferwise is the lack of customer support. Tried to write them an email, but they seem to have no option for actually contacting them, which is smart for them since they save money on customer service employees and cheerfully redirect you to the usual FAQ-type help page, but its not very pleasant when you have a large amount of money being transferred and you need help with your case specifically.\n\nIn my case I meticolously monitored the exchange rate for weeks, until I was finally ready to make my transfer, and so I did. I set up the transfer on the TW webpage and I immediately initiated the bank transfer from my own account to the specified TW account, but as the money arrived after literally 24 hours and 1 minute on their account (instead of just 24 hours), my guaranteed rate was forfeited and I received whatever else rate was available at a later point in time.\nThis seems a bit ridiculous, I'm pretty sure the money was literally 1 minute late and that this could've been the case for all sorts of technical reasons.\nI guess its their fault as such, but not even having the possibility of inquiring into whether there are any sorts of measurement inaccuraries inherent in the system or something a long those lines, just seems a tad too 'efficient' in my opinion - or rather, fundamentally not okay, when it comes to a service that is handling your money.", 'review_date': '2020-11-23', 'review_time': '14:11:12', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nNov 18, 2020\nHello Mathias.
