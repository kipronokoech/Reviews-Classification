It’s standard operating procedure.\n\nHowever the customer support agent I was unfortunate enough to put in touch with (Racheal) is just rude and cocky as hell and we keep going in circles because she just can’t seem to understand that reason why the transfer failed was because of the mismatched Wise account name and bank account name. The funny thing is, she actually told me this herself. At the beginning of the correspondence. But somehow she kept asking me to provide the bank account statement of the Wise account owner, with the transaction clearly seen on the bank statement.\n\nI’m like WT_ ? Literally you told me the whole issue was because the transfer was paid using someone else’s account, so how on earth will that transaction be on the my bank account ??\n\nI still ended up spending 2+ weeks to clear out this “confusion”, but her attitude just gets worse and worse. I tried to be nice, even used smiley faces in my emails but every reply from her is just almost insulting to read. I’m not sure where the attitude is coming from when she’s the one who is contradicting herself.\n\nIt’s really a terrible customer support experience. Half way through her mess I guess my cases got assigned to someone else, because in her reply new agent’ name has “(please don’t assign back ty)” next to it. She wrote to me once and then it was back to a Racheal all over again.\n\nI finally sent my bank statement for them to proceed with the refund, and she left my hanging for a whole week, despite my sending several follow up emails within that timeframe, and I heard NOTHING back from them.\n\nIt’s bizarre that a customer support representative can’t even follow such simple procedure when its even clearly stated on your own website.', 'review_date': '2021-11-21', 'review_time': '02:03:03', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nDec 23, 2021\nHello there,\n\nYou didn't add enough details about the transfer, so we are unable to share with you an accurate inside, however, what could have happened is that, sometimes, when we receive the money, your bank won't send us all of the details.
