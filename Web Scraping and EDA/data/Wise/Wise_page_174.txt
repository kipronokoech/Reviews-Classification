{'platform': 'Wise', 'id': '64b7b017dc2f5a8f9c5a1722', 'stars': 5, 'title': 'Forget your bank, Wise is revolutionary.', 'message': 'I started using Wise at the real beginning of TransferWise and I was apprehensive because I required to transfer my savings roughly 40K Euro from France to New Zealand. Now, what triggered my interest in the first place? I got absolutely robbed by my mainstream bank years before when I returned from NZ. My New Zealand bank (ASB at the time) told me the bank transfer fee for a normal SWIFT was circa NZD 50.00 one-off. Very well, it was reasonable so I went ahead. Weeks later my transfer finally appeared on the other side at my bank in France (La Banque Postale at the time) and I was short of nearly EUR 4,000 doing the conversion. I first thought it was a mistake, contacted my bank in NZ, they told me "it is the currency rate". I said what currency rate NZD to EUR does not make you lose a whopping EUR 4,000?! After many phone calls and emails I found out Mainstream Banks (which are opaque as you would not believe when it comes to transfers across countries and fees in general) actually gamble your money and virtually pass your money around from Bank to Bank. Not normal banks from across the street, trading banks. So my money went from ASB to Civic to Deutsche Bank of America and other banks which specialization is to "trade" currencies on the FOREX. By "trading" I mean sell and buy currencies. That was my first found but then I asked what did they do with my money?! Another long series of phone calls and emails later: "they had to change from NZD to SGD (Singapore) and to a series of currencies such as ZAR (South Africa) to end up in USD then eventually made it to EUR". I could not believe it. To trace the name of these Trading Banks was hard enough but for my bank ASB in New Zealand to tell me WHERE, WHEN and at what RATE my NZD were traded turned out to be impossible. I was told by ASB: your money was not our responsibility the second it left our bank. Needless to say I have never used ASB ever again but any other bank would have treated me the same. My bank in France could not help me either and these are legit mainstream banks, these are not obscure online banks. But that was not the end of my ordeal, not only did these many Trading Banks gambled with my money on the FOREX, every one of them charged me a COMMISSION. At this point, I understood there was nothing I could do to get my money back because taking ASB to the NZ Dispute Tribunal from France while paying a lawyer would cost me way more than EUR 4,000 and this is why mainstream banks are a mafia. ASB should have guaranteed my savings were safe or at least advised me that such system was taking place. They never did. It was a breach of Trust, an abuse of power and a failure to advise. All they told me is it will cost you only a NZD 50.00 fee which is a blatant lie. I had to call their Head Office because I was going nowhere with my local branch. So, a couple of years later I returned to NZ but this time around I knew what I was facing. So I did my research, found about peer to peer banking. Now, I was not going to transfer money to some obscure bank account in... Slovenia if I recall without guarantees, as it happened TransferWise for its debut was backed up by several captains of industry in France including Xavier Niel. I did more researches and decided that between the certainty of getting robbed by a mainstream bank and TransferWise, TW was an option worth trying. I never looked back and I have been using their app since on smaller amounts to transfer some money to my family. Why was not I disappointed?\n1/ Speed: less than 24 hours to show on my New Zealand account from my France account;\n2/ Control: the app allows to set the minimum rate that you agree with;\n3/ Cost: the transfer fee you pay to Wise is very clear and there are NO unsolicited commissions adding up to it;\n4/ Peer to peer: meaning NO middle men and intermediary trading banks to rip you off;\n5/ Ease of use: the app is very user friendly;\n6/ Security: I have never experienced or heard of any attack or intrusion;\n7/ The future of banking: it is one thing to expose the bad mafia-like practices of mainstream banks and how they truly operate in complete opacity and dishonesty but if you cannot tell people there is a viable alternative, then you\'re not changing the system. It is a long story but trust my words, unless you have a special deal with your bank or you already deal with Trading Banks yourself or banks that play on both fronts (mainstream and trading) like HSBC and they treat you like a top customer, the ending might not go your way. It certainly did not go mine. I have changed bank since but I will NEVER EVER TRUST my bank again for anything of major importance such as a large international transfers. I use WISE every single time and I am yet to be disappointed. You need to transfer money across the World? Forget your bank, go with Wise, you cannot beat peer to peer.', 'review_date': '2023-07-19', 'review_time': '11:42:47', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
