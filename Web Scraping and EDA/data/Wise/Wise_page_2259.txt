I do hope they improve on their support availability, but at least they made good with their customer relations. Many companies look good and sound good, but do nothing. At least WISE offered a material resolution.\nComplaint resolved on a good note.\n\nPrevious:\nI have a Wise Business account and use their services regularly. Most times things go fine, which is nothing great - because it should always go fine, they are holding billions of other people\'s money right! But when something goes wrong, my biggest, most frustrating gripe is, you CAN\'T contact anyone. In this internet world, an actual human to talk to on the phone is non-existent. And if you have a Business Account, you NEED to have customer service. Most times the website says "experiencing delays" and will only provide a feedback form - no phone number to call. If they actually responded to their feedback that would be something, but they NEVER answer you. Recently I needed to pay a contract sum by specific date and the web app refused to allow me to add a recipient. It was a local transfer - basic stuff. In order not to breach the contract I had to transfer tens of thousands of dollars to a different overseas bank and then wire transfer it back - hit with unfavorable exchange rates and WISE fees in both directions, for a problem which they caused. At times, you MIGHT get to speak with a human, if you can find the phone number, and they may be able to assist you if it is a standard query, but if it is something a little unusual, forget about it. They still haven\'t responded to my "cannot add recipient" problem. Anyway, the crisis is over and cost me a thousand dollars. If you are person that needs to speak with a human when things go wrong, or expect to receive a response to your feedback, do not choose WISE. You may see my post on different forums. I\'ll continue to make a noise until WISE responds to my feedback. It is not too much to ask that the "bank" actually responds to you.', 'review_date': '2022-02-14', 'review_time': '06:56:18', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

Since bills were due, I had to physically withdraw money from my AFCU account, convert to euros, then go to my ING bank and make the deposit. I lost $100 because the AFCU exchange rate is $.02 less.
