Unfortunately, after having checked with our technical team, I can confirm that we cannot accept TransferWise as a bank account as they are an international transfer service rather than an actual bank. The Scheme currently uses Western Union to provide such a service so the Trustees have instructed us to request another bank account from you in order to pay your monthly pension through Western Union.  Please can you provide this information as soon as possible. If you have any queries in the meantime then please do not hesitate to contact me.\nKind regards\nDan Morris\nFirst Actuarial LLP', 'review_date': '2021-04-20', 'review_time': '20:17:40', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nApr 28, 2021\nHello, Seer.\n\nWhen you need help with a payment is very important that you reach out to support instead.
