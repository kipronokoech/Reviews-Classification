We understand account deactivation can be frustrating, but it's never done without a valid reason. It's normally the result of a conflict with our Terms of Service or Customer Agreement, or due to a discrepancy with a financial law. We explain more here: https://wi.se/accountdeactivation_\n\nAfter you've filed for an appeal, our team will review your case and email you with more details on your refund and account status. As customer support isn't involved in the appeals process, you'll need to wait for an update from our appeals team.
