We attempted to make a payment from our business bank account to our supplier in China. However, the payment process was riddled with issues. First, the payment was abruptly paused and eventually canceled, causing significant delays in our transaction.\n\nWhat baffles me the most is that Wise seemed to have misunderstood the origin of the payment. They assumed it was initiated from a private account, which was absolutely not the case. We have consistently used our legitimate business account for such transactions, and we even provided all the necessary proofs and bank statements to verify this. Shockingly, instead of addressing the issue appropriately, we received nothing more than automated responses from their support team.\n\nThis level of disregard for our concerns and the lack of proper investigation into our problem is simply unacceptable. As a result of this frustrating experience, we have made the decision to close our Wise account. It's clear that they do not prioritize their customers or provide the level of service that any reputable financial institution should offer. I would strongly advise others to reconsider using Wise for their international transactions, as our experience has demonstrated a significant gap in their service quality and customer care.", 'review_date': '2023-08-15', 'review_time': '13:16:55', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
