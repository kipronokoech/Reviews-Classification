Part of a dissuasion strategy that aims solely and exclusively to beat the customer by the tiredness, making him give up using the resource. (Resource that forced me to change all my registration data, request new cards, and infinite times and pay fees that I would not like)\n\nProtocol numbers I already collect (25358186, 25359544, 25360414, 25360414, 25362469), the last one being 25380191. All unsolved. They are not even able to determine the reason for the problem, transferring the responsibility for doing so to the customer, requesting dozens of information that I do not know or could not know.\n\nIT IS CLEARLY MUCH MORE PROFITABLE FOR THE COMPANY IF I CONTINUE TO USE OTHER COMPANY RESOURCES SUCH AS TRANSFERS, WHICH GENERATE MUCH MORE FEES, OR THE RETENTION OF MY CAPITAL AND THAN THE WISE CARD SERVICE, advertised as a convenient solution with lower fees; IT IS NOTHING BUT A PHISHING SCAM TO GENERATE MORE DEPOSITS AND FEES FOR THE COMPANY.
