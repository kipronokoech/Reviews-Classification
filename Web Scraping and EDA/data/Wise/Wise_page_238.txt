Be wise and stay away from them.\n\nI have been using their service for over 2 years. The easy onboarding, the smooth user interface, mobile app and overall ability to make payments with virtual cards was really good about Transferwise. I guess everything changed after their rebranding to Wise.\n\nSuddenly after two years of operation, they have just withheld a $xx,xxx ( 5 figure ) transaction hostage. They wanted a notarised declaration of shareholding to be provided which has been duly done from my end. I spent $300 for it.\n\nTheir customer service that is the worst. Especially for a financial company with whom you trust your money with.\n\nHere is what happened. They suddenly paused a 5 figure transaction and just sent an automated mail asking for a signed declaration and threatened to suspend my account. The phone number on their website does not work ( broken / old number is what is listed ), live chat on their website is never available and email by their words will respond after 24 hours or several days. WOW, a financial institution whom you trust with your business and hundreds of thousands of dollars does not even have a proper way to reach them.\n\nThe emails from their support team is super slow, not formatted and every time a new person responds who doesn't even bother to look into the previous conversations.\n\nThis is not just my experience. When other had shared such horror stories on twitter even I ignored them. Dont take my word for it, go and read such experiences on twitter. Wise is great when it works. But you definitely cannot trust them with your money. I don't know if they even have a physical office. I am flying down to Singapore to visit their premises to see if its even a real office.\n\nIf you are the founder of Wise reading this review, remember this, no company that has a poor customer experience ever thrives, let alone survives for long. A fancy app and great branding will only take you so far. It's how you treat your customers that earns their trust and loyalty.", 'review_date': '2023-06-17', 'review_time': '10:56:14', 'CompanyReply': 'Reply from Wise\nJun 20, 2023\nHey, Swaminathan\n\nThank you for taking the time to explain your situation.\n\nVerification is how we keep your business’s money safe, and comply with the financial regulations in the countries we operate in. We do everything we can to make it quick and painless, but we also need to make sure your business meets our policies. That’s why this process can’t be rushed and at times will take a little longer than we first expected.\n\nAs a financial institution our goal is to always treat our customers money and accounts with utmost security. We want to and have to assure all customers that our platform is safe to use.\n\nWe do have our official support channels here at https://wi.se/contactus_ or through social media channels (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram). Yes indeed we have temporarily closed our chat, but only to improve it and can back even stronger.\n\nWe have offices all over the world, including Singapore, but please mind that they are not open for customers.\n\nWe value your feedback highly and most certainly will forward this to the relevant team, so we can grow to an even better company.\n\nWise', 'CompanyReplyDate': '2023-06-20', 'CompanyReplyTime': '12:33:38'}
