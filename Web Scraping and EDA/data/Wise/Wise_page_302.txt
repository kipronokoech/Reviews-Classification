I have been using it for almost two years now to send small amounts of money to my fiancé in Thailand and, with a few exceptions, it always worked great: the money was in her account within seconds pretty much every single time. But not this time... and this was the one time I happened to send a large amount ($12,000) to help her pay off her mortgage after selling her house, so she can finally prepare to come to live in the USA.\n\nWorking with Wise to try to solve this issue has been the most frustrating and draining experience. The people taking my phone calls are great (professional and nice) but day after day all I\'ve been getting is empty promises that the issue would be resolved by the end of the day or by the following day. As of now, the money is still in transit ("Sending") and there is a *really high* chance that it will arrive too late for her to keep her current appointments with banks and government entities to finalize her paperwork. I am still holding my breath, but also losing my hope as reality sinks in. (Obviously, at this point, canceling the transaction is pointless, as it would take longer for me to wait until I receive the money to send it on a regular wire transfer with my bank.)\n\nIn sum, use your judgment.

We totally understand how frustrating unexpected fees and interest can be, however, we can assure you that we don't scam anyone, and we'd like to shed some light on the situation.\n\nWhen it comes to payment processing, every merchant, including Wise, has its own unique Merchant Category Code (MCC). These codes help financial institutions categorize the type of payment being processed. However, only one of our MCCs is forwarded to the bank, and unfortunately, we don't have control over which specific code gets sent.\n\nHere's where things get a bit tricky. Once you initiate a payment using your credit card, the MCC associated with our service is sent to your bank. The bank then makes the decision on how to charge for that particular transaction based on the MCC they receive. In some cases, certain banks may apply additional fees or treat the transaction as a cash advance, which can result in extra charges and interest.\n\nIt's important to note that we don't have visibility into these specific bank charges because it's the bank's call. We don't see or control when or how they apply these fees. Therefore, if you were charged extra by your bank, we unfortunately can't reimburse those fees. We recommend reaching out to your bank directly to discuss the charges and seek clarification.\n\nIf you have other questions or need help, please reach to us here: https://wi.se/contactus_ or on Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram with your email and user number.
