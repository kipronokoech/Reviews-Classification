We always appreciate hearing from our users!\n\nJust to let you know, you should be able to use your Wise card in most places where debit cards are accepted. However, if for some reason a payment is declined, we'll always let you know why it happened. You can find this information by clicking on the declined payment in your Transactions.\n\nAnd if you have push notifications or transaction emails turned on, we'll send you a quick message explaining the reason right away. If you don't see the reason, it's likely that the merchant has the information, so don't hesitate to contact them for more details.\n\nSince you mentioned this happened with large payments, be sure you haven't reached your spending limits: https://wi.se/spendinglimit\n\nAnd here you can find other common reasons why your card might be declined: https://wi.se/declinedtransaction\n\nIf you ever need help or have questions, you can always reach out to us through our contact page: https://wi.se/contactus.
