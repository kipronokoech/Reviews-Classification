During that time there were no major issues, so I had no need to contact customer service. This week, however, I had, and my experience was awful.\nI mistakenly transferring money to the same account from which it was sent, and I contacted two customer service operatives (one per chat and another per phone), neither of whom showed any sympathy for my plight.\nGiven that I'm a customer of 10 years, and that Wise received a charge of 80 pounds for routing money from my account back into the same account (at no charge to themselves), I would have expected a refund or at least an offer to waive the charge for my next transfer (which I've been making every month for three years). But I was told that there was nothing they could do.\nI know this was my mistake, but given that it surely cost Wise nothing to take money from my account in one country, only to wire back into the same account (alongside the fact that I've been a customer for 10 years), I would have expected some help.\nSadly, however, I didn't get any. Wise is a decent service, but don't expect any customer support.", 'review_date': '2021-12-30', 'review_time': '18:45:18', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
