The reason I used Wise and not Revolut is because Wise as supposed to have better customer service. How wrong I was. Customer service asked me some questions when money was sent, which I answered. Now I have been waiting 13 days and there is still no response and money is still blocked. They do not respond to emails and now the phone number seems to be out of service. The only way to et hold of them is by messaging app where they say they will get back to me "soon". Honestly it\'s pathetic. I will be using a bank from now even if it costs a little more in exchange rates. So far 13 days has gone by and this could last several more possibly even a week or more.

The transfers are even faster. I have a debit card that works with multiple currencies, so I never have to worry about a bad exchange rate abroad. (Not like travelling is gonna happen this decade, but still.)\nThey also added virtual cards, that are super useful. A company signs me up to a subscription hidden in a one-time purchase? No problem, that card does not exist by the time it would be charged. Another company only allows card purchases, but then leaks data like sieve? No problem, that data is useless to the hackers.\n\nThey also have local account numbers, so you can accept payments like any bank account. A lot less red tape than going through all the different ways different banks do know-your-custumer. This is done once, used and reused again without the hassle.\n\nThis is an excellent tool for sending money abroad, getting paid abroad, travel money and online shopping.
