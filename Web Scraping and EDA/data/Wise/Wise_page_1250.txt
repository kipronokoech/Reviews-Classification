One of the most cost-efficient way to transfer money overseas in small amounts (most cost-effective one I found so far for the $100-$200 range at least). Plus the 'bank' details and being able to keep multiple currencies in one account are very helpful as well. Usually very fast as well, though some currencies may take longer.", 'review_date': '2022-08-12', 'review_time': '09:39:39', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

Great exchange rates so despite the fees you still save.\n2. Extremely quick transfers out often transfers take only a few seconds to reach the recipient even when transferring large sums.\n3. Good communication via phone calls and emails when a transaction is paused for whatever reason.\n\nNegetive points:\n1. When transferring large sums into your wise account, there is a lot of paperwork and proving where those funds come from so give yourself lots of time. I realise it is heavily regulated to prevent money laundering but they need to streamline this for their customers. This process took multiple phone calls, emails and took up a whole day. My physical bank only took 12 mins to transfer the money out and that was during peak hours with people waiting in front of me.\n2. The interrogation on accounting for everything feels very heavy for the average person just looking to buy a house and makes the process stressful. Again this could be changed by streamlining the process and although their staff were helpful, they would benefit from having a deep understanding that they are a complete stranger asking for very personal information. So a gentle approach rather than a 'matter of fact' approach would be better received by your customers.", 'review_date': '2022-08-12', 'review_time': '09:27:41', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
