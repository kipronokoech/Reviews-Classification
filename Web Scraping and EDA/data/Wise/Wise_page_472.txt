I have attached this screenshot and evidence to Wise in my recent email to them.\n\n✓I didn\'t set up external account in wise and like I said the person who hacked my Wise account added set up and added the external account. As I indicated that someone pretended to be a Wise Agent and got my ID card and also gained access to my Wise account and hack it on October 26, 2022 and added an external bank ending in 4691. I am not the original owner of this bank account and I didn\'t authorize wise to add such account under my profile because it\'s the hacker who did, so it doesn\'t have my authorization.\n\n✓I have stated to Wise that the transfer in question should not have been directed to the MYR bank account that was added by the hacker, but rather directed to my USD account details which I provided to Wise along with the remainder of my balance refund.\n\n✓This is because the account ending in 4691 is a compromised account which was added by the person who hacked my Wise account and it doesn\'t belong to me, and as such Wise is owning me because I stated to Wise during emails and calls that all few days to Wise refunding my money that all my balance refund should be sent to my USD account details.\n\n✓Also, I wrote in email to Wise on October 29 2022 and October 31 2022 informing wise that my Wise account had been hacked and that the external account added was from the hacker and that Wise shouldn\'t send any money in there. I\'ve attached a screenshot of everything to Wise in my recent email.\n\n\n\n✓Again, for the fact that wise already moved my funds under the transfer #527038814 to my balance when they deactivated my account, then it becomes "Remaining Balance" and wise has stated on their website what would happen to customers remaining balance after deactivation which wise said that all balance balance would be paid into a bank account provided by the customer which in this regards is always submitted to wise secured website during submission of bank process which I submitted my USD details to wise and as such, all my balance would have gone there and not seperately since I already indicated to wise on call too about before they sent me part of the funds.\n\n✓I had already written to wise in my emails dated January 14, 2022, January 15, 2022, January 16, 2022 and January 17, 2022. I also spoke with two Wise customer support team on morning and afternoon of 17th January 2022 asking them if they had seen my email with the account details where I needed all my funds and pending transfers before wise even sent it.\n\nAlthough Wise said the following to me in the last email:\n"I know this is not the outcome you have been hoping for, but we do not uphold your complaint.\nThe transfer in question was directed to account details previously inputted by yourself and there was no received indication that this account was no longer in good standing.\nAs such,we are unable to offer you a refund of the amount".\n\n\n✓I want Wise to take note that I told them that I didn\'t previously added any external account ending in 4691 and the account belongs to the hacker who hacked my Wise account. I have submitted all evidence when I told Wise not to send any funds to that account since October 29, 2022.\n\n✓I had sent email to Wise titled A REQUEST FOR MY CASE TO BE REVISITED with ticket number 26046404 and all documents and evidences to proof to Wise that I have won this case. I need a compensation and my my funds from Wise and wise has to honour the Section 12 of their agreement to Malaysian Users.\n\nAlso UK Financial Ombudsman and Malaysian Ombudsman asked me to contact Wise to refund my funds to me', 'review_date': '2023-03-03', 'review_time': '10:23:35', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

I have had a terrible experience with them recently and I am sharing this review to assist others who may be in a similar position or who may be considering using this service. My account was deactivated without notice to me. I discovered the deactivation when I attempted to log in. The guidance provided by the Help Center is circular and unhelpful. You spend much of your time going in circles. I obtained some assistance from a Facebook Group formed by persons who have had their accounts deactivated also. This deactivation of my account has occurred at a terrible time when I am abroad for a Conference and I have planned medical appointments and fixtures. It also occurred on the very day of WISE deciding to rebrand. When I first realized I was deactivated I also thought I may have been hacked and I was afraid that the requests to input information through the appeal process may have been phishing since the layout of the website and the colors used by the brand were different. Due to WISE I am anxious and unwell with no access to my funds held with them and no comfort as to when my monies will be returned to me. In addition, WISE will only return your funds to you in one currency so that all the efforts which you may make to buy and hold currencies will be lost if they deactivate you. They have also removed my access to my documents and balances and my own membership number which they then request in order to “help you”. Truly an awful experience and so unexpected given that up until the deactivation I had absolutely no complaints about WISE', 'review_date': '2023-03-03', 'review_time': '03:17:54', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
