However, their competitiveness went downhill as compared to likes of Ria and Remitly over the years. After about 2.5 years of being their exclusive user, I started comparing them with others in market but still used them seldomly. Their service was great until I recently used it.\n\nMy recent transaction was repeated twice for some reason without me being aware of it. When my recipient notified me, I was very surprised since it never happened before in tens of my personal transactions. When I called their customer service (only because I couldn\'t file a complaint on their app or online interface), first the representative acted clueless as in how can this happen. That\'s supposed to be customer\'s reaction, not the rep\'s. Then he started putting it on me "your account must have low balance" etc kind of bullcrap. Just because of this experience for their long-term user, I am not going to recommend Wise.com to anyone.
