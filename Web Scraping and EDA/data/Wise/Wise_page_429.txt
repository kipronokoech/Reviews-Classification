We explain more here: https://wi.se/swiftpayments_\n\nWe understand that it can be confusing, but we are, in fact, transparent with our fees. And that's why we show you a disclaimer before you send us any money - you can always choose yourself if you're comfortable with this fee.\n\nIf you need more clarification, please reach out to us at https://wi.se/contactus_ with your transfer number and we'll be happy to answer your questions.\n\n- Wise", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2023-03-30', 'CompanyReplyTime': '03:12:15'}

I don\'t know why it\'s so difficult to reach customer service or any help at Wise, nor why they make it so difficult to find things like account details on their website. It definitely needs an ugrade in both website and customer service.\nBUT in the end, the transfer from UK to Spain went fine, and my money arrived swiftly.\n\nI perfer the customer service at Key Currency but there are useful aspects to Wise, such as named accounts.\n\nI\'ve left my review at 3 stars because it was so complicated getting set up. But it did work, so I can\'t really complain.\n\n\n\n\nUPDATE\nOK so since my review below, I got verified (!) and have successfully done one transfer. So I\'m less furious but still appalled by the lack of customer service. I may try another transfer and re-update.\n\nI am so fed up with Wise. There is almost zero customer service.\nI have submitted the documents they require (investment portfolios/bank statements etc) multiple times over the past couple of weeks, only to receive (24 hours or more later) an email saying\n"It has come to our attention that you have uploaded the documents incorrectly, which means the right team might not see them. Please double-check this."\n\nSo I have then double checked everything, resubmitted, and... guess what... I get the same email 24 hours later.\n\nI\'ve been in this circle of hell for a couple of weeks now, with no clear idea of what is inadequate about the information I\'ve submitted.\nThey now have copies of my passport, driving licence, investment portfolio, bank statements... yet can I transfer money to them or make use of their so-called service? Nope.\nThere is no live chat, no phone number, only an email option with a promised 24 hour response time, as though that\'s something to be proud of.\nIn the business of time-sensitive currency exchange, you\'d think they\'d spend something on staff being available.
