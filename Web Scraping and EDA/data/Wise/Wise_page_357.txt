For example:\n- Upcoming withdrawals: no announcement of upcoming withdrawals from account so that you can prepare and plan\n- Full balance overview: in individual transfer statements it is not shown what the account balance was before the transfer and the account balance after the transfer\n- "Smart Conversion": when you have multiple accounts in different currencies, and your balance in currency X is not sufficient for a payment, Wise takes money from your account in currency Y. They call it a "service" but they don\'t warn you so you can prevent it and it can lead to a payment costing 10 to 20% more.\n- Blocking payments: Once a person or company has your card details, they can continue to take money from your account. You can\'t block anyone from taking payments and instead have to directly address this with the company/person who may be wrongly taking payments or have bad intentions. Wise does nothing to protect you when you flag this.\n- Customer Service: my experiences with the CS have been poor at best. The responses from customer service are robotic and they don\'t seem to have actually read your message, value loyalty or get the concept of customer care.', 'review_date': '2023-05-03', 'review_time': '04:27:01', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
