I was given a rate for 72 hours, as it was over a weekend, and went to my local bank branch on the Monday morning and made the transfer within that 72 hour time frame. This is something that I have done previously without issue. I then discover that the money being transferred to my account was around £300 less than the rate that I was originally quoted. I had checked the current rates on the Monday morning I knew that they were not as competitive as my initial quote. Therefore I would not have gone ahead with the transfer if I knew that I would be given that lesser rate. Wise should have informed me if the rate I was been given was to be changed. In that scenario I might have held the money with Wise and waited for a better rate. As it is, Wise has cost me money and I’m not happy about it. Therefore I will be looking to find a new means by which to make my transfers transfers.\n\nSince getting very little help from Wise, I have now discovered OFX give just as good rates and a 5 working day window in order to make the transfer as opposed to Wise's 24 hours, which really helps if you are in a remote location. Wise will not get my business again.", 'review_date': '2021-12-20', 'review_time': '12:57:07', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nDec 20, 2021\nHello there,\n\nEach time you set up a transfer, you'll receive a guaranteed rate for that individual transfer - as long as we receive your money within this timeframe the rate would be honored.\n\nYou set your transfer up on the 5th November, but we didn't receive your funds until the 9th December, your guaranteed rate expired on the 8th November - this meant the mid-market rate was used to complete your transfer.\n\nEverything was explained to you in details via email as well.\n\nWise.", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2021-12-20', 'CompanyReplyTime': '10:33:26'}

Very happy.\n\nHaving spent 30 years expatriated, I have systematically been ripped off 4.5% in transfer commissions and exchange rates by HSBC. Wise has averaged 0.3% in total transaction costs over the last 12 months... no comparison!\n\nMost recently tried to close my TDAmeritrade accounts which they refused to do by EFT, despite the previous 22 years of exclusively electronic transactions both incoming and outgoing. Ameritrade insisted they could only issue bankers cheques to make good on their capital repatriation obligations, which to this day (more than 6 months later) still have not settled. It more closely resembles theft than reasonable transaction incompetence and delays.\n\nIt is my view that Wise will sort the dinosaurs out! HSBC and Ameritrade assume we are each lost in the past, with no enduring memories of the last 30 years. But not so. And for each and every time they ripped us off, our children, and grand children, and great-grandchildren will remember and never use their services.
