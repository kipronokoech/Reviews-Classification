I started using Transferwise a few years ago. The rates beat the banks and the tranfers were easily done and tracked with the app. Recently, I\'ve noticed that the rates are increasing and the customer service is canned responses and zero help. I have sent tens of thousands of dollars using this service, now rebranded to Wise. I go to set up a recurring transfer to pay my rent and I need to be verified. I go through the process and it seems to be working. But now, I can\'t add money to my EUR or USD account because I need to be verified. What happened to the other verification? Why did you take the money from my account and THEN choose to want to re-verify me? When I ask about it, I get "We are a bank and want to keep your money safe". No response to why the second verification. No response to why verify me years after using the service without issue. I hope they get the message and roll back some of the "upgrades" and remember they are a not a bank without users and money. Also, are you a bank if you need to tell people you are a bank? Ok, process my money Wise!

We understand your concerns regarding the recent changes you've experienced while using Wise, and we'd like to address them.\n\nFirst, we'd like to assure you that verification is a crucial step for us in maintaining the safety and security of our platform. As a responsible financial service provider, we are committed to complying with regulatory requirements and ensuring the protection of our customers' funds. While we strive to make the verification process as seamless as possible, periodic re-verification is necessary to maintain the highest level of security.\n\nWe understand that the timing of the re-verification may have caused frustration, especially when you were attempting to add funds to your EUR or USD account. We apologize for any confusion caused by this situation. Our intention is to safeguard your funds and account.\n\nRegarding our recent fee adjustments, we want to clarify that market conditions play a significant role in determining these costs. The fluctuations and volatility in the global currency markets can impact the expenses we incur when buying and selling currencies. However, we continue to provide you with the mid-market rate, as sourced from Reuters. This rate is updated in real-time during trading market opening hours.\n\nWe value you and the trust you have placed in us over the years. We are constantly working on improving our services and address the concerns raised by our customers. Your feedback is invaluable in helping us identify areas where we can enhance the Wise experience.\n\nWe understand your frustration, and we apologize for any inconvenience caused.
