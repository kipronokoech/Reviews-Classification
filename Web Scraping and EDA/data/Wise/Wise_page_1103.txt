However, it is unreliable. Twice without notice they have stopped all services for 2 weeks without notice to "update documents". I have no objection to checking and updating documents, but doing so without notice, without any pattern or predictability, and freezing all services is unacceptable. This last time it happened in the middle of setting up a transaction and paused the transaction. I have a vendor waiting for payment for 2 weeks and I look terrible because I promised that I sent it, and I did, but it was put on hold until the document check is finished. It makes it impossible to rely on Wise as a business tool. Because I never know when it will be shut off.\n\nWise hides behind the idea that they are a “regulated financial institution” and can’t avoid a two-week delay and suspension like this. That’s ridiculous. Every other credit card company, investment broker, bank and lender is also heavily regulated. None of those take two full weeks of suspended services just to finally ask if we are doing business in sanctioned countries (we aren’t). Those other companies have the same regulations but make a call the same day and get the question resolved and services resumed in two hours, not two weeks. And they tell you why a transaction was flagged immediately, they don’t simply flaunt their contractual right to freeze your services and then turn off all their customer service numbers like Wise does. If documents need to be updated, let us know in advance like every other responsible regulated financial institution and we will provide required information or documents immediately to avoid a disruption of service. Compliance issues can be handled in a much less disruptive, more organized, more respectful, and faster way.', 'review_date': '2022-09-12', 'review_time': '14:00:13', 'CompanyReply': 'Reply from Wise\nSep 12, 2022\nHello!\n\nVerification is how we keep your business’s money safe, and comply with the financial regulations in the countries we operate in.
