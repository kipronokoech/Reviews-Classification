Wise paranoia decided to close the account once I had withdrawn the ¬£100 odd quid in it. Instead they immediately froze the account PLUS my personal account. Apparently to verify my account. Interesting as I have had the account for maybe one year.\nI have told them in no uncertain manner to transfer my cash out and close the account as I have no intention of using a bank I can‚Äôt trust. I am still waiting for them to do so.\n\nIn response to Wise's reply: You haven't closed either account, you have frozen them. But Wise emailed me to tell me that only the business account was frozen and that my personal account wasn't. So I accept that you have frozen the business account, but I do not and will not accept any reason why you have frozen my personal account. The fact that you do not seem to realise you have frozen my personal account is of even greater concern.
