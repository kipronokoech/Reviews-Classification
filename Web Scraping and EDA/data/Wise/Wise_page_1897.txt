This is to ensure that Wise is safe and secure for everyone on it.\nAs processing these checks is a legal requirement and therefore cannot be avoided, we have the following section in our Customer Agreement agreed by you upon opening of your Wise account: https://wise.com/terms-of-use\n\n“Verification checks may increase the time for processing your transfer order. We carry out verification checks, and these checks may increase the time it takes to process your transfer order. We cannot be responsible for any delays as a result of carrying out those checks.”\n\nWise', 'CompanyReplyDate': '2022-04-18', 'CompanyReplyTime': '08:27:57'}
