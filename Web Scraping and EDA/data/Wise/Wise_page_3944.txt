I know this may sound a strange statement but is infuriating when you make regular monthly transactions and suppenly out of the blue, your application once having funds taken from YOUR own personal and usual existing and known bank account (to Trabserwise) and sucessfully placed into YOUR own existing Transferwise account to forward on in a different currency to YOUR own personal and known (to Transferwise) foreign established bank account, why a transaction is 'paused' for 'consideration and verification' of your authentication? When NOTHING has changed from normal and previous transactions your long-standing 'verification' by Transferwise themselves somehow becomes an issue is frustrating at the least when time is of the essence for said transfer of your own funds. In many ways that is NOT a security issue but a Transferwise own internal systems issue.\nI also do not like the way ever since Transferwise set up their own depositing of funds into your own Trabsferwise account and to sit in said account to transfer at will for the customer. That may be convenient or even preferable to some customers but not to ALL. So i (and presumably all Transferwise customers) have a somewhat confusing two box view of (and in my personal case) an account showing ¬£00.and another box suggesting 'transer amount'? Having already gone through the procedure (as always) of drawing the monies from the home account successfully and confirmed 'monies recieved' by Transferwise but own account still showing a balance of ¬£00 how can you transfer ¬£00?\nBefore this two box system was introduced some time ago it was a much simpler protocol of withdrawing funds from bank account A transfered directly to Transferwise and then one only had to confirm same destination to Bank B in a foreign country of residence. None of which are huge sums of money which would even be considered under any 'money-laundering' suspicions. So yes, this time around very disappointed in the service. As it was all so unnecessary as funds DID arrive on time otherwise I WOULD have given a score of one star, closed the account and used a competitor.

I can see that my colleague already sent you an email with some updates regarding your case but I'd also like to add that verification is one of the ways we keep your business‚Äôs money safe and comply with the financial regulations in the countries that we operate in.\n\nRequests for additional information can come at any time during a financial transaction. We do our best to get all of this out of the away ahead of your transfer, but if requested by our partner or partner bank, we must comply and ask for the additional details whenever they ask.\n\nThanks\n\nJoao", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2020-10-26', 'CompanyReplyTime': '13:49:21'}
