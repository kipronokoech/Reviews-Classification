I am also curious that since I have used your service two times previously, why you needed to verify my business. Also why was my passport needed???\n\nMost frustrating was that you had no chat or phone number to call. I was left in the dark for 24 hours not knowing if I should cancel my transaction and simply go with a wire from my bank. The extra 40.00 it would have cost me for a wire would have been worth not knowing how long I would have to wait to determine if you were going to accept my transfer.
