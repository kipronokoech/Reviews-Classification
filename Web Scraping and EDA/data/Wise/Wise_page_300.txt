And concerns about their security.', 'message': 'I was the victim of a large scale fraud on my card ($3000+). The first issue is that while my visa debit card’s details must have been compromised on an online shop somewhere, there was no two-step verification on the fraudulent transactions, for some reason, and they were able to steal my money with ease it seems by making online purchases through a superstore in a different country to where I am currently. Secondly, I reported immediately by putting the transactions under dispute. Wise initially acknowledged the 25+ transactions were fraudulent and began to recover and return my funds. However there is one transaction they did not investigate, and they refuse to provide an explanation about why. It is the same as all the others. They have stopped communicating with me, will not explain their process and why this one transaction is being treated differently, and do not reply to emails. Unlike with other banking providers they will not allow you to talk directly to the card fraud team dealing with the case. So you never really know what is going on, only hear ‘we are looking into to it’ etc. If you want get stonewalled when you ask for any kind of detailed explanation about whats happening with your money, and you want to feel like the criminal in the event you get scammed, this is the card for you! I see they actually reply to reviews on here, which is more than can be said for their emails!\nUPDATE: As you can see from the reply below, the response you get is bland, uninformative platitudes with no efforts whatsoever to answer the specific questions asked. Either on why their verification failed in the first place, or why they won’t investigate one specific transaction out of 25+ identical ones.\nUPDATE: Wise now ignoring all messages on social media and through the app. Presumably they will stonewall me now until FCA process is underway. Whole experience has been horrible.
