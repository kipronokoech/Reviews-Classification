Your fees can still be brought down for repeat customers like me.\n4. Detail for a transaction in Home screen is not showing the locked rate properly. May be you can add locked rate for each transaction in Home screen itself.\n5. There should be a way for me to download all the transactions I made as a CSV or PDF.\n6. Your Help is not clear cut, I needed to read many pages to understand how all this works. And help pages on cancellation and its impact on fees increase needs to be corrected.\n7. Lastly you should be able to pay the destination over the weekends also, why not?\n8. If the money is paid and rate is not good, then customer should have an option to keep the money with wise so that it can be used for next transfer.
