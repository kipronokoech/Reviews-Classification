We're working towards a free to use product, but we haven't reached this goal just yet. Until then, we'll always disclose our fees before you pay for your transfer, and we keep our pricing as transparent (and low) as possible.\n\nHowever, your transfer was sent via SWIFT, which has higher costs.\nWhen the money is in transit, correspondent banks in between may also deduct their handling fees. Your bank should be able to advise what those would be.\nMore here: https://wi.se/swiftpayments_\n\n\nWise", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2022-04-07', 'CompanyReplyTime': '07:53:15'}
