Honestly pathetic. You close peoples hard earned money with no warning and communication then try to incentivize people who barely even used your platform to give you 5 stars. All those who have been SCAMMED, give the ONE STAR REVIEW AND BRING THEIR RATING TO WHERE IT SHOULD BE. ONE STAR.]\n\nSimilar to all of the other reviews below this is an absolute great a sham ever! Transfer wise notice is this because look at how many people they need to pay to review now invite to review! Don’t listen to these five star reviews.\n\nMy story is like the story below! In the beginning it was fine they gave you and asked you for a ton of confidential information to verify your identity and address proof all of which we had provided and that should’ve been all fine! And then for no reason and they don’t tell you when this happens they will block your account by which you have already probably sent through 5000 or in my case £200,000 worth of cash and then they will freeze it! And then they will tell you with that they don’t know where it is and then they won’t tell you when you will get it back! And then they will consider that to be a very not a big issue even though to you it’s a huge amount into a lot of people it’s a huge amount! SCAM.\n\nHaven’t got my money back and I won’t get my money back probably until three months later by which goodness knows what they’ve done with all of my money and how much financial trouble I’ll be facing because I’ve chosen to trust them to send money to the person I need to send money to but of course I am just a person about to money launderer and I am a big thief so they must go through extensive checks and if I’m not willing to provide three months of my bank account statements then I’m basically a big thief. This is a amazing assumption and I hope they do well in their IPO.\n\nThose people haven’t had their money held for 20 days with absolutely no communication is of course they’re giving five stars! Wait until you are one of the ones with £5000 or more at play and absolutely no communication of to where the funds are then you will understand why there are so many one star reviews and please join me in giving one star reviews because they need to know that this is unacceptable!', 'review_date': '2021-04-04', 'review_time': '04:04:25', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nMar 23, 2021\nThanks for sharing your feedback with us.\n\nWe understand having your account closed is frustrating, but rest assured we're not carrying any type of scam nor we're paying for good reviews.
