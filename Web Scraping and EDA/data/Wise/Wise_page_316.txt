Please allow us to address your concerns.\n\nFirstly, we want to assure you that we don't close accounts without a valid reason. Our aim is to maintain a safe and compliant environment for all our users. We ever only close accounts that are being used in a way that goes against our Terms of Use: https://wise.com/terms-and-conditions\n\nTo better understand why your account was deactivated, you can visit wi.se/accountdeactivation, where you'll find some possible reasons that may apply.\n\nWe understand that you may have made only a few transactions during your short time with us, but it's important to note that the number or value of transactions alone may not be the sole factor in the decision. We take various factors into account when making such decisions.\n\nRegarding your appeal, if it was rejected, we won't be able to reverse that decision. Our team thoroughly reviews appeals, and once a final decision has been made, we are unable to change it.\n\nIf you had any remaining funds in your account, we assure you that we'll work on sending them back to you. However, before we can do that, we need to carry out due diligence checks to ensure compliance. Rest assured that during this process, your money and personal information are kept safe and secure.\n\nIf you have any other questions or need help, please don't hesitate to reach out to us via our contact page: https://wi.se/contactus_. You can also connect with us on Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter, providing your registered email address.\n\nThank you for your understanding.\n\nWise", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2023-05-30', 'CompanyReplyTime': '06:49:25'}
