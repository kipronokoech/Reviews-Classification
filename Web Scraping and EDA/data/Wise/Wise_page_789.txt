If larger amount of transfers of legitimate funds is an issue, why not spell it out beforehand so we know not to use it?\n\nThe support channel also does not work, the support article is giving a number that is not in service.\n\nI don't think I'm able to recommend Wise to anyone if you are using it for more than a couple of hundred dollars worth of transfer.
