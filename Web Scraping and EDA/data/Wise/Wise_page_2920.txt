Could not fault their cost, speed of service (transfers) and customer service.\n\nSince changing to Wise and with the introduction of some ‘compliance changes’ it’s been very difficult to operate incoming payments. We had over £160k of inbound payments under ‘transferwise’ in the first year, no issues. Under ‘Wise’ we had roughly £20k at which point we was asked to provide proof of funds as a business for the previous 12months?! They had access to every transaction and details of every customer account which sent money to us to pay for services (interior products). We did.\n\nSince changing their compliance every other transaction is halted and we are made to provide full name, D.O.B and full address of the sender. Some of our clients have real issues with us as a company having such sensitive information given we already had a lot of info on them. This is clearly a data protection issue.\n\nUpon asking them to cancel these inbound payments we have now been waiting for 4 weeks and no assistance (funds sitting in limbo or their ‘interest’ account) which is causing cashflow issues, to the point we have to now use a traditional big 4 bank.\n\nI love digital banking, we loved digital banking; but if this doesn’t stop it defeats the point. Asking for a business customer to provide D.O.B of our clients (senders of funds) as a way to be within their compliance parameters is beyond a joke. We are already a verified customer, ID verification at that. This additional compliance aspect is ruining their business customer service and we have resorted to using traditional Banking.\n\nThis year we are expected to turnover £400k, business ‘Wise’ will loose out on.', 'review_date': '2021-08-13', 'review_time': '13:59:34', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nAug 24, 2021\nHello, Leon.\n\nRest assured, it is never our intention to delay payments or just hold your funds. However, as a regulated financial institution, we're required to extra checks on transfers from time to time, and we need to be very diligence with those.\n\nThis is a standard procedure, and it can happen at any point - even if your account is already verified. Do keep in mind, if a transfer is pending checks, it isn't possible to cancel until the checks are completed, but we'll always make sure to keep you updated along the way.\n\nWise Team.", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2021-08-24', 'CompanyReplyTime': '08:44:55'}
