I sent money to my Wise account to transfer it further to my other account, not for Wise to seize it and verify its origins for weeks or months on end. I paid due fees and I expected Wise to do what I paid them for - to make the transfer, fast, not to scrutinize my background. My bank from which I made the transfer to Wise already did that. Yet Wise failed to do the very thing their customers expect them to do in the first place. Why bother? SWIFT transfers through your bank take slightly longer and cost more but at least they work and nobody keeps your money under false pretenses indefinitely.\n\nUPDATE: Two weeks later still no response from Wise\'s so-called "due diligence" team. Instead, they have the nerve to copy-paste a generic response that they gave other scammed customers! What a bunch of nonsense about their due diligence process. I\'ve been sending SWIFT transfers via different banks to different countries with no problems. Enter Wise and they start schooling me about due diligence. Like it\'s non existent in the banks and other services I\'ve been using prior to them!

It helps us combat money laundering, and keep everyone’s money safe. That way we can keep providing you even faster, cheaper and more transparent service.\n\nThat being said, due diligence is not just a word we say, but an actual requirement for us to provide a safe and secure money service. We do understand that waiting after your transfer might be frustrating, but security on of our top priorities right next to speed.\n\nThat's not all – we also have different regulatory requirements in different regions. Because of this, we might need to ask more, or different, questions, depending on where you move money to or from, or where you live.\n\nWe know this is personal information. So we try to ask you the least we can, to still complete all the checks. We always store your information securely, in line with our privacy policy. You can check it here: https://wi.se/privacy_others\n\nTo sum it up, we're here for you and your money, but we want to do it safely and securely.\n\nWise", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2023-05-26', 'CompanyReplyTime': '11:54:57'}

Verification is a very important step for us, and because of that we’re very diligent with this process. Speed is our priority, but so is keeping your money and our platform safe. When there is a delay, it means we need a little more time to verify the information you have shared, and updates are shared as soon as everything is completed from our side.\n\nWhen we verify your account, using your account may be limited. However once we finish the check you're free to use your account again.\n\nWe'll gladly have a second look at this and help you out.
