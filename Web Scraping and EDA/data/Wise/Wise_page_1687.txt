Thy ignore you and move the goal post every time you talk to them . The only thing Wise does is explain is not their fault and the money still not arrived. I was told the manager was going to call within hours and I'm still waiting after 6 days...I the had an email telling me the transfer is potentially violating international law. The transfer is for a building business in Spain, the Architects surname is Cuba.Well..... wise is asking me if the money is going to the country Cuba hahaha you couldn't make it up this shows how inexperienced and lack of detail from this bank. The money still in limbo ‚Ç¨1482 and still not replied to me or giving me the money , I predict I'm not gonna see the money for another 20days....
