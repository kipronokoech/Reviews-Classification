I was planning two holidays in France and Spain earlier this year so topped up my Euro currency account in advance. Late July we went to Normandy and stayed at a hotel near Dieppe. On checking out I attempted to pay in Euros using my wise card which was rejected. I called Wise but a message told me there is a 30 minute delay answering calls. I gave up and used an alternative card. (Long waiting times now seem to be a standard feature of Wise service) Then in September we visited Majorca. I withdrew euros twice from my Euro account (or so I thought) but both applications used my USD account, first converting to GBP then to Euros incurring additional fees. On returning to the UK I brought the issue up with Wise who blamed me claiming I chose GBP to convert not local currency. What nonsense. Wise asked if I wanted to pursue a formal investigation. I declined closed my account and ended my relationship with Wise.', 'review_date': '2022-11-15', 'review_time': '13:21:40', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nNov 16, 2022\nHello David,\n\nWe appreciate your feedback. It's always our aim to give our customers the best possible experience, and we're sorry to hear our services has fallen short of your expectations. There are some reasons why your card can be rejected, and we explain some common troubleshooting steps here: https://wi.se/declinedtransaction_\n\nIf you're withdrawing money from an ATM in another country, it's best to check if you're withdrawing in the local currency to prevent any additional fees. Some ATMs charge their own fees, and they’ll usually say so before you get started. If you see any extra fees, you’ll have the option to cancel and use a different ATM.\n\nWe understand that you've reached out to us, and you aren't satisfied with our reply. We'll continue to work hard to better your experience and hope that you'll give our service another chance in the future. - Wise", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2022-11-15', 'CompanyReplyTime': '23:49:52'}
