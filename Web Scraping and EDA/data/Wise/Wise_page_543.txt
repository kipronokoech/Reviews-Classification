When you open a bank account, you usually need to take some ID into the bank branch. Wise is no different. We‚Äôre a financial institution, so we need to know who‚Äôs using our service. It helps us combat money laundering, and keep everyone‚Äôs money safe.\n\nSo depending on where you‚Äôre sending money from, and how much you send, we‚Äôll ask for you to verify your identity. This helps us keep your money safe.\n\nWhen we ask for more information, it typically means that the that we can't accept the document according to our regulations. By no means it's never our intention to make this difficult for you, quite the opposite. Our mission to be as easy to use as possible, but we need to all this while obeying to our regulators who give us the licence to operate.\n\nHere are the possible reasons of our refusal:\n\n1. It may have some of the information covered. We need to see the full document photo page.\n\n2. It may be expired. Please check that your document is still valid before you upload it.\n\n3. Your details may not match. Please check that you have entered your name and date of birth correctly on the website.\n\n4. We may also need to see the back of the document. If there is information on both sides, please make sure you upload both for us.\n\n5. It may be a document type that we can‚Äôt accept.\n\n6.
