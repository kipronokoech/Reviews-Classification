We can't think of one single transfer that would have cost us less than Wise during this time either!\n\nWhen Wise introduced the MasterCard we saved even more!! And it's so easy to use and pay in local currency! We often travel to and from our home in Poland (I'm English, my wife is Polish) and the card was absolutely brilliant when we stayed in Poland for about 4 months in 2020 (yep, to get away from higher Covid rates!!). No more poor rates and exchange fees per transaction from the bank and retailers! Perfect.\n\nWhy pay the greedy banks and point of sale companies when you have Wise to rely upon.\n\nTHANKS!", 'review_date': '2021-08-09', 'review_time': '14:42:10', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
