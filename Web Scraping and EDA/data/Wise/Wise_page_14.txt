They don't care about your business, only the fees they can make.", 'message': 'Wise is a very unprofessional entity, claiming that you can do a lot more with their accounts than you can. In reality, if you receive payment from a third party, they will close your account without notice.\n\nWe had a business account with Wise that we used for almost a year. We used the account mostly to make small payments and payment expenses via the digital cards. We only did small payments because of the terrible reputation Wise has of closing accounts for no reason.\n\nFast forward to a few weeks ago. We emailed Wise, asking if we could use the account to receive larger payments (as our business application specified). Wise Support emailed back;\n\nThank you for being our valued customer!\n\nOf course, you can receive large amounts directly with your account details. Keep in mind that you may need to give us some extra information, we may need to ask you about your relationship with the sender, or the purpose of the payment. This is a regulatory requirement for us.\n\nClick here to learn more about this situation\n\nLet us know if you have any other questions. We’re always happy to help.\n\nKind regards,\n\nWise.\n\nStill not trusting them, we had a $7,500 wire sent in yesterday. What does Wise do? They "deactivated" the account. The fact is, how can we (a business) explain this to our customers? The wire is just going to be reversed, and then we will have to give the customer a new bank account. Its totally unprofessional.\n\nPast this, Wise lost its banking relationship with Evolve Bank and Trust in the USA, and their digital card issuance, from Wise recently;\n\nYour Wise Business debit card will no longer work from October 31.\nWe emailed you recently to let you know about some changes that would affect your local USD Business account details. We’re also updating how our debit cards work for businesses in the US, which means you’ll be unable to use any US Business debit cards you currently have from October 31, 2023.\nWe’re really sorry for the inconvenience this may cause. This is temporary and we’re working hard to fix it.\nWhat this means:\n• You won’t be able to spend with your Wise Business cards, in person or online\n• Payments made via your mobile wallet using these card details, like Apple Pay and Google Pay, won’t work\n• Any subscriptions or recurring payments using these card details won’t work\n• Any refunds for transactions made with your old cards will still be processed, and the money will be added to your balance\nNothing else about your account is changing. You can still top up, send and receive money from all your balances.\nWhat happens next?\nUnfortunately, we’re not sure yet when you’ll be able to get a new card. We’re working hard to fix this as quickly as we can, and we\'ll let you know about any updates in the coming weeks.\nWhat about personal cards?\nIf you have a personal card linked to your Wise account, it will keep working as normal. You can still use it for any non-business related payments.\nWe’re sorry we’re limiting our services at this time. You can find out more about this change here.\nThanks,\nThe Wise Team', 'review_date': '2023-10-28', 'review_time': '20:32:14', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
