I tested the service with a modest transfer $1,000 to make sure it worked for my recipient and then tried to transfer $10,000. Initially the app said it would take 15 minutes, then it went to 3 hours, upto 8 hours, then a day and now 8 days later my funds still have not transferred and Wise no longer guarantees the exchange rate so I don’t even know how much will be transferred. I have also used XE.com, which is a much better service and you can easily and quickly speak to a live person. There is no question about funds availability and I have spoken to my bank about it. They also offer a service, which is only slightly more expensive - I will be using my bank next time. To anyone that wants to move more than $1,000 I recommend you do not use Wise. The poor service is 100% down to Wise - no question. I have tried to find a number to speak to someone, but there is not a “who to call” option on the app. There is not, as far as I can see, a contact us option.\n\nPS - now 10 days with no progress - I have cancelled the transfer and moved my business to my bank. Sometimes paying a little more is necessary to get the service you expect.\n\nPPS - following reply from Wise. I fully expected Wise to automatically defend its service levels, but the reality is that XE.com can move cash more quickly and my bank, who I reverted to in the current instance had the cash fully transferred and cleared within 2 days. There is evidently something wrong with the process you follow and in this technology driven age I am not persuaded by your explanation of “due diligence”. Enough said - I will stick with my bank for future transactions.', 'review_date': '2021-03-19', 'review_time': '15:18:51', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nMar 19, 2021\nHello, Duncam.\n\nWe aim to stay as accurate as possible with the estimate delivery we give you, but delays can happen if we're carrying financial or verification checks.
