Prior to leaving, I verified two bank accounts and transferred money from one into Wise, converting to Euros. It took a couple of days for the transfer to be complete. That was okay, since it was the first transfer/convert/deposit. The Euros were in my Wise account the day before we left the country. So far, so good.\n\nA few days later, in Greve, Tuscany, I wanted to get more Euros into my Wise account from my US bank. Went online to my Wise account, did the transfer, and the Euros were in my Wise account virtually instantly. Thought, "Hey, this is great!"\n\nTwo days later, I tried to do the same thing in Florence, transferring money from the same account. Wouldn\'t work. Tried transferring from my other account, same result. Checked the accounts online to make sure there were funds available. There were. I ended up going to a bank and getting Euros from my bank debit card.\n\nThe next day, the day before we left, I tried doing the same thing from Montecatini Terme. Finally, got Wise to transfer the money, and received a response that the transfer was successful. A few minutes later, I received an email from Wise, telling me that the transfer would take a bit longer than originally expected, up to two days! Ended up using my bank debit card to get Euros and canceled the Wise transfer.\n\nWhen it works, Wise is great! But, it left me stranded in Italy! Thank goodness I had my bank debit cards with me!

But delays do happen for different reasons. It could be because the transfer was set up closer to the weekend/holidays, or because we needed to carry extra checks.

Furthermore, the support team confirmed all of the funds had already bounced back to the account used to pay us, which is a lie as our accounting team confirmed nothing has been refunded.\n\nHonestly, this was super screwed up for me and I think I'd rather just switch to Revolut or even PayPal at this point.", 'review_date': '2023-10-17', 'review_time': '21:57:27', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

On 10 October the message was changed to "whenever we can, sorry".\n\nToday the 10th working day has passed - so I can rightfully say that Wise henceforth will be known as Dumb.\n1, They can\'t work within their own guidelines\n2, They expect us to stand by for these random checks - right now I had to circumvent all this nonsense in order to pay my staff.
