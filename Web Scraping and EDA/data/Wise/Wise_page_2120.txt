What needed to be verified was just PRESSING A BUTTON on the site. It was ridiculously easy to fix and I am not sure why they didn't send me the link when I first asked.\n\nCustomer service is an abomination. I tried calling the Brazilian call center today and waited for 1 hour after giving up. I will keep this as 1 star because they did not send me anything about the account verification and because I couldn't talk with them on the phone when I needed to.\n\n---\n\nThey blocked my account for no apparent reason yesterday (1st March). They said I needed to verify something but never sent me any e-mails and there is no mention of any verification procedure at the messages tab. Now I cannot make any transfer and Wise kidnaped my money.\n\nThe worst part is that this is the beginning of the month and all my money is in this account. I cannot transfer money to pay my bills, buy food or even pay my rent. If things are not sorted by Friday I may become homeless. They put me in a ridiculous stressful situation because of their incompetence.\n\nI am also at risk of losing my job, as I would be moving to the USA this month and now I cannot even pay for the travel tickets, Airbnb, food, etc. I cannot use my card, I cannot do anything.\n\nI do not recommend Wise anymore. The lack of responsibility is absurd.
