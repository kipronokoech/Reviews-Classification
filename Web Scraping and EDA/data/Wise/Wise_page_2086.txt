Quick cheap transfers and decent customer service in the past. But things seem to have changed. I have an annoying and potentially serious problem with my account, the fault is not theirs i should add. Tried calling them about 2 weeks ago, but could not get through. So sent an email and got back a sort of automatic reply with link which did not work. And anyway the reply did not really address the problem, which should be so easy and quick to fix their end.\n\nToday I called and was told wait time would be over one hour. So I've sent another email, but feel despondent about a useful reply.\n\nCan't believe it as they were so efficient before. What is going on. I'm feeling edgy.
