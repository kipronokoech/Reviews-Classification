Very transparent and speedy process. Also helps that the rates are much better than a bank or money exchange. Love the multiple currency accounts on 1 card. Living near a boarder between 2 countries with diff currencies itâ€™s been a life saver and far cheaper than using my traditional bank card where every transaction in CHF I was hit with an addition â‚¬2 on top of the transaction amount as it was non Euro account. It quickly adds up so having the ability to be in a shop or resto and quickly transfering from Euros to CHF in an instant to pay for something was fantastic.\n\nThe downside of your service is the new charges. Seems to be more expensive than before and also taking money out of ATM can add up especially in Spain where many restaurants you canâ€™t split the bill on card so you need to have cash when in groups. There have been times I would have loved to use WISE as my only bank and ditch my traditional French bank account but without being able to put cash in an account via a machine or in some instances being limited to how many times you can get cash out of ATM without racking up the charges.. I need to keep it.\n\nAlso sometimes not having the same customer service functionality compared with a traditional bank like if you need to query a charge can be a hindrance but the good outweighs the bad and itâ€™s how you keep your costs down. Overall I love WISE and while many people are a Revolut fan I will stick with you guys.

For a list of where you can use your card, please check out this link: https://wi.se/whereyoucanuseyourcard\n\nIf your withdrawal is declined, don't worry; we'll provide you with a notification explaining the reason â€“ for this, you should have notifications enabled. You can also review the details of the declined transaction in your activity list.\n\nOne common reason for declined withdrawals is an incorrect PIN entry.
