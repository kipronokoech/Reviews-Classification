The last A got left out (autocorrect?) and my transfer was flagged. They wanted to know if I had a connection with Iran! I actually find this incredibly racist. Persia was the cradle of civilization at one point. There are many Persians in the world who have nothing to do with Iran who live in other counties. I have Persian friends who had to flee their country many years ago. What If I had been buying a Persian rug? My money was basically frozen. Neither in my account nor sent to the recipient. Once I told them that no, I had no connections with Iran the money went through.\nIt was pretty scary though that my money was considered not my money for well over a week. I have lost my trust in Wise, that‚Äôs for sure.\nThe chat people were VERY snotty and rude while I was trying to find out what was going on.
