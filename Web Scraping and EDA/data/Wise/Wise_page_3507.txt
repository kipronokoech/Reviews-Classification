Also the exchange rates are very competitive. The support so far always reacted quickly and mostly competent.\nWhat is way too complicated is sending money to other people which also have got a TransferWise account. According to TransferWise there are several ways to do so, but none of them work but one (It took me an hour to find that out). For doing so, TransferWise wants access to your whole Addressbook and even uploads it to their server which is an absolute no go! Seems like they've never heard anything about data privacy.\nDepending on where you live it can be very complicated for other people to send you money. For example you can't receive payments in CHF from other people which haven't got a TransferWise account.\nSo, 5 Stars for the exchange rate and the credit card. 4 Stars for sending money abroad (It would be 5 Stars if more country would be supported). Around 2.5 stars for receiving transfers and doing transfers from one TransferWise account to an other. 1 Star for privacy since the try to access and collect your contacts.", 'review_date': '2021-01-28', 'review_time': '09:49:58', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nFeb 3, 2021\nThanks for sharing your feedback with us, Michael.\n\nProtecting your data and financial details is very important to us, so rest assured this is something we take very seriously.
