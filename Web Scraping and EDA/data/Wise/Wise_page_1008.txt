I understand you need to do checks to prevent money laundering. However, you can conduct identity checks before you take money from people.\n\nIn addition, once I verified my identity. I was able to make one transfer before wise deactivated my account. I got no email to inform me my account was de-activated, no reasons why!!!! I discovered my account was suspended when I attempted to login to the app. The next process is to go through a burdensome appeal process.\n\nI was informed by the automated service I cannot speak to an agent with regard to my account suspension because they cannot do anything! In addition, they are very busy and call waiting time is in excess of 30 minutes. More wasting time!\n\nI assume my account got suspended because I asked them to refund the money back to my card! I requested a refund because I was unable to verify my account because I had no passport. My biometric card expired and I was awaiting a decision from the Home Office. The company could not accept any other identification verification documents.\n\nIt is disheartening that my account was de-activated without notice once I finally managed to verify my account. Yes, I finally received my biometrics residence permit from the Home Office.\n\nThere are better money transfer services out there with far less hassle and who will not be wasting your time.', 'review_date': '2022-09-29', 'review_time': '14:30:26', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
