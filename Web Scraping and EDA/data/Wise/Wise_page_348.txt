Account deactivation isn't something we take lightly. It's normally a result of a conflict with our Terms of Service or Customer Agreement, or due to a discrepancy with a financial law. We can't always share the exact reason for the deactivation, due to how we're regulated.\n\nHowever, you can find some possible reasons here: wi.se/accountdeactivation.\n\nOn this link, you can also find which steps you can take to make an appeal. Once you've done it, our team will review it and reach out to you ASAP.\n\nAs for the remaining money in your account, we'll work on sending it back to you. But first, we need to carry out due diligence checks. While we do that, your money and information will be safe and secure.\n\nIf you've already made an appeal, we can also check if we received it, for this please contact us here: https://wi.se/contactus_ or on Twitter, Facebook, or Instagram with your registered email address.\n\nWise", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2023-05-08', 'CompanyReplyTime': '09:16:32'}
