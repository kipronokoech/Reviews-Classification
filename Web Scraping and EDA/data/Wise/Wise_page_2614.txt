The two things should be separated, of course: Announce background checks in time, give the client time to submit documents and a channel to communicate with customer service... but block the account only after, let\'s say, three weeks, when the client does not comply! There is no logical reason to block the transactions of customers that are already in good standing! And: WISE has NO customer email channel (as least I could not find it, with my Masters Degree in Social Sciences and 30 years of experience in financial services), only Facebook.. and then tells me not to use unsafe social media channels... hahahaha...
