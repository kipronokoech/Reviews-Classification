I get the status as Funds refunded by the receiving bank, which is absolutely fake information as I checked with Citi bank and they don’t have any such information on fund transfer. Not sure what is the actual reason I need proof from your end proving you have sent fund, as when I call your customer executive simply apologies and say the funds are not initiated from your end. Need to understand why is this happening and why is Wise holding funds of its customer.. is it you gain some extra points for showing your liquid position strong by customers funds in transaction.', 'review_date': '2022-08-16', 'review_time': '21:53:38', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
