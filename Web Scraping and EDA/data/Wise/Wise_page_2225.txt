While I was receiving monthly salary payments from the UK and spending the money using the borderless account, I didn't have any problems. However, for the business account, when I was receiving regular USD payments that I piled up and exchanged approximately $30k every 3 months they started blocking transfers. It's understandable that they ask for additional details and papers to prevent money laundering but their process is chaotic. They rejected a still valid national ID card on grounds that I've provided it before and cancelled an already delayed transfer without notification. You then have to get in touch with them to find out what happened and what else they need. Luckily, some people have a driving licence or a passport as other form of ID but if you have a single ID that they've seen before, you're out of options. They definitely need to improve their processes and communication as this can result with money loss due to currency fluctuations as well as delay your payments.\nOverall, there's money to be saved if you're dealing with multiple currencies, even with their fees considered, but I can understand why some businesses/people prefer to stick to traditional banking to avoid these inconveniences.", 'review_date': '2022-02-05', 'review_time': '07:44:40', 'CompanyReply': 'Reply from Wise\nMar 7, 2022\nHello Florin,\n\nWhile our goal is to complete all payments as fast as we can, we‚Äôre a regulated financial institution and as such, we need to carry extra checks on transfers from time to time.
