This past year, it\'s been rapidly getting increasingly more of an uphill struggle to send even small payments to any account anywhere, even to other, same-owned Wise business accounts, and significantly worse since this new greenscheme front-end rebranding that seems to have done, at best, nothing for the backend.\n\nEvery time now, KYC kicks in, re-asking the same source of funding questions over several emails, over several days, taking much time for compliance in giving the same, no status change info that was given before.\n\nThen it tells you that replying to the emails that they ask you to reply to aren\'t accepted and to go through the platform.\n\nAnd then it tells you that the documents aren\'t acceptable, even though you give them exactly what they\'re asking for - Bank statements showing source of income (i.e. Statement from the very same Wise account that I\'m trying to withdraw from - see what I mean? Pointless BS KYC Loop!)\n\nJust what is all that extra, unnecessary, sketchy at best customer support doing for the Wise corporate balance books?\n\nRight now, it looks like I won\'t even be allowed to send my own money to a new personal bank account outside of Wise, as I\'m now considering alternatives, as I suspect that Wise could well be in the firing line for collapsing under the weight of its own administrative BS, and reduced cashflow caused as a consequence of what seems to be this trend of throttling transfers.\n\nVery much heeding the warning given by the unfortunate Wise client who recently had $86k frozen in another review post on this site, below.', 'review_date': '2023-03-12', 'review_time': '17:43:49', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
