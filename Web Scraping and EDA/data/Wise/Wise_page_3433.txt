The company will 100% scam your money, it's just a matter of when.\n\nI returned to the UK in the summer from Sweden and have spent the last 7 months working on covid-19 faster-testing, and vaccination supply distribution and renumeration projects in the UK as a Lead Software Engineer for the NHS. I left behind my home and I have been temporarily separated from my family, a personal decision of mine as I wished to help with the UK effort against the pandemic.\nWhen arriving in the UK, as it was the height of the pandemic, despite trying to open an account with a reputable bank (HSBC) the process was taking longer than usual and my employer needed an account to pay my first months salary into. I therefore did some googling and decided to open an account with TransferWise so I could receive my first months paycheque from the NHS, soon after opening an account with TransferWise it was deactivated for no reason whatsoever - I provided my identification multiple times, I had proved who I was, but no matter what there support team would not re-open my account. I had asked my employer to stop the payment of funds to the account, but they had informed me it was too late in the day to do so. I then tried to explain the situation to TransferWise, letting them know my employer was unable to re-direct the transfer into the account, and asked what would happen to the money (Almost £5,000 GBP) when it was sent to their account. To which their support team informed me the money would be bounced back to my employer. However, this was not the case and for the last 6 months TransferWise has been holding my salary from the NHS and appears to be purposely avoiding providing any support or customer service to myself. Whenever I call them, I am told I will receive an email letting me know the next steps, the email tells me to contact their appeals team, and their appeals team then tells me they can't access my account because it's deactivated, and the cycle continues.\nFor six months now, TransferWise has been holding my salary in escrow and does not seem willing to return this.", 'review_date': '2021-02-13', 'review_time': '19:07:38', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
