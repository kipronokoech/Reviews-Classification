I’d like to have a look at Wise financial statements – 100% sure we can find there “miracles”. Especially in cash flow ones.\nWhat it means for you as a customer?\nSuddenly you receive a notification from Wise like “Wise is a safe and regulated way to send and receive money. And sometimes we need to check how you got the money you’re receiving…” or “we require further information before we are able to release the funds”. Any kind of a bullsht like that.\nIt doesn’t mean at all that Wise needs your explanations/documents etc.\nThe only thing Wise really needs is your money.\nWe provide all the documents on the same day. It never helps. We write to the support – they either ignore you or send standard answers like “we may take a little longer than usual to review yours — our estimate for most transfers is 5-10 business days, with some as an exception taking longer”\nThey can also ensure you they sent the money. This is a lie. They never able to confirm their words with documents like MT-103.\nWise needs your money to plug holes in own cash gap.\nDo believe me – Wise knows for sure, that customers won’t file a court at once.\nWhen they feel the situation is heating up – they release the money.\nBut the day comes they won’t. Because they became insolvent.\nAs a CFO with years of back-up, I don’t advise you to trust Wise the sums you can’t afford to lose. Just set up your limit.\nWise is really not a company you can trust your significant turnover.\nHave a look at the information on their supervising authority’ website fca.org.uk\nDiscuss it with your lawyers - they won’t be happy.\n\nWith brgds,\nCFO Bulent Yesilyurt', 'review_date': '2023-04-27', 'review_time': '11:44:40', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

The appeals process is nothing more than a tick in a box, you will be unable to access your funds and they will offer you zero assistance. Then they will ignore requests for details as to the how they calculate the repayments after the issue. I strongly encourage to do what I will be doing, which is to raise a complaint with the financial ombudsman.
