I've never had so many consistently awful support experiences with any other company I've dealt with.\n\nIt was helping to solve a big manual problem of paying overseas employees. But there are enough errors and problems in each batch run that it creates even more work than if it were manual. When it works, it's great. I can live with this if they had the willingness to work through it.\n\nHowever, their support representatives were not only not knowledgeable in their product. They were slow to respond and sometimes didn't without several follow ups and they had no desire to help fix the problem so that we could enjoy their service as it was intended.\n\nWe are in the process of transitioning our business to another provider because of their lack of support. This is a huge lift on our part but with no support, even the best products will fail.\n\n(Update) Raised the issue again with their support team and this time they were willing to escalate to their technical team and fix the problem.\nFYI, reply below to my review is incorrect. That is not the issue I was working on in the ticket.

No other recent issues.\n\nDo keep in mind, customer support doesn't have the ability to speed up or process payments from their side. Each currency will have their own processing time and our team can't act on that.\n\nMaybe sure you're reaching us from the correct channels, as support is available.
