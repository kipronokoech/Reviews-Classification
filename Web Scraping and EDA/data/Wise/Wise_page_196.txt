Payments were made as milestones were met. Later I bought a completed condo from the same Canadian developer and of course it was a fairly large transfer. Wise asked me for info about the big transfer for the completed condo. Source of money, contract, etc. Did that. No problem.\nSo, almost a year and a half later, they asked for info for every transfer to the developer. I was ill and didn't respond to their email for just a few days. Wise emailed that they are closing my account. I uploaded everything they asked for, Passport, DL, contracts, where the money came from (sale of home and a couple of rent houses), income, who was my employer...everything. Explained the why the payments were not in one lump, etc. and they STILL said with a stock email that they were closing my account. Said I could appeal their decision only AFTER they closed my account. Well, screw ME!\nTold 'em they could s*ck my b*lls.", 'review_date': '2023-07-06', 'review_time': '21:53:35', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

Being that I live in a 3rd world country, managing overseas payments has always been a massive pain.

So I finally dropped them.\n\nMeanwhile, my experience with Wise has been surprisingly straightforward. Their service is very well designed and seem to function as intended, with little to no need to contact their customer support. Although, when I have, I was given robust support.\n\nFunctionally, their speed of sending international transfers is very decent. Their prices for currency conversions are competitive. And I haven't had any issues sending or receiving money before, in or outside of the US.\n\nPerhaps my only complaint is that their Wise card is not available in my country.

When I finally got the notification, Wise also told me that I need to confirm whether the address registered with my account is indeed my address (??). I would have had to upload gas, utility or tax bills to do that, but I, not physically residing on my official address, could not do either of them. After a talk with customer service, we agreed that I send them an e-mail with some other documents proving my address. I did and they accepted it. Now, when I am checking the status of my incoming payment it still says that I won't be able to access it by Monday next week.\n\nThis is absolutely outrageous and unacceptable. I did nothing wrong in the first place. Then, I complied with your requests, and yet I need to wait another 4 days to get my payment that I need on my account URGENTLY?\n\nI have better things to do than wait for this ridiculous company to give me my own money.
