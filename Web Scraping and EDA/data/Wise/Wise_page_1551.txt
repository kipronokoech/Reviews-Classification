Wise are sadly no longer 'Fit for Purpose' as far as I can see", 'message': 'I would rated Wise zero stars if it were possible to do so. Wise are currently sitting on £5000 + of my money - for over a week now and are neither returning it to me or sending it to the destination bank in Italy. The objective was to use them to transfer this to Italy to pay the balance of funds for a holiday. I have previously paid the deposit via Wise only a month ago with no problem from the same account to the same account. The issue, they say, arises through checks which need to be run due to random international sanctions against Russia due to the Russia/Ukraine situation. Yet although these random checks appear to be expected by financially oriented institutions- they clearly do not have the facility and infrastructure in place to process them swiftly enough so as to comply with their own duty of care to the customer. It is very worrying.\nI am coming up against nothing but a customer service interface who clearly have no power except to trip by rote off circular and meaningless platitudes and cannot give any assurances as to where my funds are or when they will be processed or returned. Any attempt to speak with anyone who can actually resolve this for me is impossible and twice customer service have put the phone down on me.\nHaving used Wise for 5 years previously, I feel completely let down made to feel like a criminal for wanting to know what is happening with my own money. This is causing me immense personal stress. I am an ordinary individual and £5000 is a huge sum to me. I have no faith that Wise will give it back to me. I can therefore no longer recommend Wise as they have broken all trust in their processes and ability to put effective measures in place to treat their customers well.', 'review_date': '2022-06-20', 'review_time': '18:06:36', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
