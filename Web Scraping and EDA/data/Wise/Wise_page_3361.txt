Then out of the blue TransferWise decided to reject one of my payments and close my account without any prior warning, without access to my previous records, and with little to no recourse.\n\nThey closed my account stating that I breached their Usage Policy. Which I did not. I sent them a link to their own website which explained in detail that what I was doing was permitted. But that fell of deaf ears.\n\nTransferWise either have conflicting policies between what they publicly advertise is permitted on their platform, and what they privately don't permit. Or, perhaps their staff selectively misinterpret their publicly stated policies.\n\nIt cost me time and money chasing down the rejected payment. I would have been better off using the traditional banking system. Which I am doing now, and the bank fees aren't that dissimilar to TransferWise. In fact the bank doesn't charge me with hundreds of dollars in currency conversion fees.\n\nI say good riddance to TransferWise.", 'review_date': '2021-03-13', 'review_time': '01:26:43', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nMar 12, 2021\nHi Ada.
