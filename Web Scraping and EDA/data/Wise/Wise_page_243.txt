Despite my repeated attempts to contact them, I received vague and unhelpful responses that did not resolve my issue. Moreover, my personal account was deactivated without any valid reason.\n\nIt is frustrating to see my account being deactivated while I was simply trying to create a business account. I fail to understand why my personal account was affected by this situation, which has nothing to do with my personal activities.\n\nThis situation is even more concerning as I am awaiting an important transfer to my personal account. It is a refund of VAT related to a legitimate transaction. The amount involved is substantial, and it is crucial that I receive it as soon as possible.\n\nWiseâ€™s customer service has been ineffective, and I am deeply disappointed that I could not resolve this issue. This unjust deactivation of my personal account has directly impacted my ability to receive the rightful refund.\n\nI am sharing this experience so that other users can be aware of the issues I encountered with Wiseâ€™s customer service.
