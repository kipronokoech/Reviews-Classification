I called to the bank, bank said money has been reached to trustly at same time. I contacted trustly and after few continuous mails they responded that money has reached to wise at same time with prrof of reference. I gave the proof of mails to wise support team. Wise support team still saying we have not received your money and reasons are my bank and trustly which is completely baseless. I tried to give the reference number i received from trustly still the same answers. In the beginning they mentioned they will try to find solution in 2 days now they started mentioning it may take 5 days. seems like there customer service is so poor feels like you are talking to boats and when i called them they simply put on holds for more than 15 minutes with same boat like answers. For now it seems i am in situation of indefinite illogical answers.', 'review_date': '2023-01-20', 'review_time': '19:14:35', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

There was a time when they replied that "your processing time can be extended and will revert you within 60 working days".

That\'s the only thing I liked but still "I think".\n\nAt last, I would like to suggest Wise Transfer to change its rules for reverting money.
