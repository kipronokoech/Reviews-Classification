The transfer made to Wise now isn't refunded nor hits the account for 7-10 business days. I called them 2 days after the email because they didn't reply via email for 2 days. Then, they said it will either hit the account or will be refunded that same day. 3 days later called again because the money was still gone and now they told me that more info was needed and once I send 7-10 days money is gone. They can't refund. They are badly affecting the business.
