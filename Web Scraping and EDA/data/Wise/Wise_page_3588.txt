The speed of transfer is excellent with mostly same day or next day transfer of funds guaranteed. It is secure and extremely reliable. However the charges have crept up and the pace of change with competitors such as Revolut and other alternatives with lower charges and more flexible transactions are making these look more and more attractive as an alternative particularly where lower value transactions are involved.
