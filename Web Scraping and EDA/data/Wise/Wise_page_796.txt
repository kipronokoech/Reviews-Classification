If your sender paid in a different currency to your Wise account details, we won't be able to receive the payment as it'll be automatically bounced-back and returned to the sender. If the payment is sent to us via SWIFT, the return can take a longer time, passing through intermediary banks. Some rejections can take as long as a few weeks. I'd suggest having your sender's bank put a trace on the payment. Thanks for understanding. - Wise", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2022-11-09', 'CompanyReplyTime': '00:26:47'}
