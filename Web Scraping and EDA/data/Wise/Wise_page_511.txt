Their delay cost me $2k based on the difference in exchange rate by then. I explained that would be the case as they were insisting on returning the money, but they couldn’t have cared less.

An hour of my life I will never get back.\n2) selfie function in app in same verification journey fails to turn the camera to allow a selfie to be taken (forget joining Wise if you live alone - you need someone else to take the photo or to take a photo of yourself on a zoom call that only you are invited to!)\n3) selfie function that takes you to a blank 'check your photo page' with no link the view the selfie you just took, or even time to review after pressing the button to take the selfie in the usual 'use photo' 'take a new photo' manner\n4) No response to allow photos matching or the alternative allow manual matching buttons in app the next verification.\nSo I then followed the manual upload of documents, and enjoyed being told that my passport had been verified in a call to the customer support team to get help. Only to then get an email saying it had failed, and still being routed through the same steps again when I again tried to add the balance. No joining up of customer journeys at all.\n\nAs an ex Product Manager, now a Product VP, in digital healthcare, and the verification squad Product Manager to boot; my view is that in finance, like healthcare there is no room for poor software. Neither I or my team would ever have allowed such a shoddy release to go live. How does any dev team think its ok to release with 4 customer journey step failures out of 5 steps?!\n\nIf this is the state of the verification functionality, I question whether I should trust the Wise's software development teams to protect my money.\n\nGuess I can kiss goodbye to my hope to use Wise to get the best transfer prices as I move my euro salary back to pay my tax bill due on 31 Jan.
