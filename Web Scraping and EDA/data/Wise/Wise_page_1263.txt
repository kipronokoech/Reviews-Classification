They used to be very easy to use and have a great customer service. I've now just opened bank accounts with them for 3 currencies. The idea there is good one as well, offering an easy way to manage multiple currencies. Unfortunately I am unhappy with the experience. I personally choose not to use my phone to handle money. This is a choice for security and privacy, among other considerations. However Wise does not offer any other options for opening an Euro account than via their phone app. This seems like a totally unnecessary restriction to me. Also their customer service is poor at this time. There's no chat function available, phone call gave a waiting time estimate of half an hour or more and when emailing them, they say they try to reply within two working days, That is poor!\n- I did download the app and then deleted it as soon as the account was opened.\n\nAlso the customer support via email answered me two times, and both times they clearly didn't understand my request. - Or maybe they just pretended not to?
