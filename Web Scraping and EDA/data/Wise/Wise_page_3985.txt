Transferred money within a week to the recipient and also to his own account. After that, I could not enter my account, wrote to my e-mail and I was told that my account was blocked, I need to go through verification, I sent all the necessary photos, after 10 days of waiting I was informed that my account was blocked for 60 days!\nI wrote to them for a month with a request to unblock, they said to contact them after 60 days. Recently 60 days have passed since the blocking. I wrote to them and received a response so that I could send them the requisites for withdrawal, I sent the requisites and for two whole weeks they have not sent me money, they rarely respond to e-mail, you will be lucky if they answer at least once every two days. I have to write to them every day and wait for an answer for 3-5 days, after which everything will wait so much again! They took 2400 pounds from me and have not sent my money back for 70 days, they just took my money and took it! I am extremely dissatisfied with this service and there are doubts that they simply deceived me with my money and will never return it. Dear transferwise, if you are reading this review, please reply to my mail! I have been waiting for an answer for a week and you just do not answer me, I cannot contact you!\nWouldn't recommend this service to anyone!", 'review_date': '2020-10-06', 'review_time': '18:17:16', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
