They are trying to blame their latest failure on a bug in their system - "please cancel your transfer and try again"...\n\nThe thing is, now the exchange rate has changed, I actually would have been better off financially now, if I\'d used PayPal in the first place!\n\nAnd PayPal is so much simpler - the process of setting up a transfer on Wise is convoluted and frustrating.\n\nI can\'t help the feeling that Wise is a bit of a scam. To be competitive, their margins have to be super-tight. So when the Forex rate is on the rise, they\'d stand to gain by cancelling a transaction and advising the account holder to re-do it.\n\nOn my second attempt about a week later, due to the change in the rate the transaction cost was around $40 more (this was a transfer of around $1000) which of course means they\'d make a bigger fee on it too.\n\nChanging their name to Wise is the ultimate irony - take it from one who knows: you\'d be Wise to avoid them!', 'review_date': '2021-06-24', 'review_time': '01:09:03', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nJun 28, 2021\nSorry to hear you didn't have the best experience while using us.\n\nFor a while now we're offering much more than just money transfers and we wanted a name to reflect that.
