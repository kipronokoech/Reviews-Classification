You would expect a FINTECH company to see your declined payment attempts and to help you to sort out the issue. After I entered wrong pin 3 weeks ago I try to unlock my card at least 4 times but I couldn't. Now I can only use it to withdraw cash but not for card payments. I wasted hours with their useless customer service and all they could say was that they saw no declined payments and there is no blocking on their side. They say I probably damaged my card which is a complete BS. Their card service and customer support is not something to rely on.

You are told there is a 20 min to 1 hour wait on the phone, if you are lucky to get through you are fobbed off with excuses and the agent does not listen to you but just keeps repeating a standard reply.\nThis company sat on a large transfer to usa for over 6 days . Their excuse for not delivering the money was that the bank in USA had rejected the transfer due to not recognising the account details. I made a second attempt and the same answer. When I used a different company to transfer there was no problem, A thorough investigation was made by my sons USA bank and they stated no money ever came to them . Wise is clearly lying they simply sat on my money and did nothing or used it for their own benefit. They need to find out from their Usa distributing bank why they failed to deliver. Wise has done nothing and have not responded to my email to them. If you want stress free service from a company than stay away from WISE also read other people’s reviews which are very similar to my terrible experience', 'review_date': '2022-04-07', 'review_time': '10:48:31', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
