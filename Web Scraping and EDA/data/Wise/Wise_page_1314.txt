Speed is our priority, but so is keeping your money and our platform safe. When there is a delay, it means we need a little more time to verify the information you have shared, and updates are shared as soon as everything is completed from our side.\n\nCustomers are our highest priority, and we never want to make them feel like we don't reply or care. However, we're receiving higher volumes lately and email reply times can take up to 1-2 working days. We're always giving our best to make it faster, we're also actively recruiting new agent to maximize our coverage in all timezones.\n\nWise", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2022-08-02', 'CompanyReplyTime': '07:21:39'}

I used to lose a lot of money converting my dollars into Swiss francs at airport conversion kiosk (and my bank didn‚Äôt offer a much better rate) , but now with Wise My family or I can simply send money directly to my bank account with ease and peace of mind I‚Äôm getting the best possible conversion rate! I love how wise also shows you the past 30 day history, although I wish they would show a longer history maybe 1 year at least. The reason I can‚Äôt give full 5 stars yet is because at times (only a couple of times) I‚Äôve been charged a foreign transaction fee when sending money back home in my case. I know this isn‚Äôt a fee from Wise itself, but they should take this into account when they add up their fees because this automatically destroys my awesome conversion rate. Most of the time however there are no foreign transaction fees, only those isolated times. I recommend Wise too all my friends and family when coming to Europe! It really does help you get the best possible rate. I only wish they didn‚Äôt charge for a physical debit card as well.
