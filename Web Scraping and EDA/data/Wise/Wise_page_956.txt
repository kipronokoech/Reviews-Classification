It initially cost me DKK 5,000 to contact Wise. 3 banks have been involved and WISE don't care!\n\nOn 29/08/2022 I applied for a Visa Debit card. Paid DKK 61 for this card. Created my APP and could see everything was fine after I sent all my documentation who I was. Everything was accepted.\non 31/08/2022 I deposited DKK 1,000 via my visa debit card from my own bank and DKK 5,000 directly from my bank to the Danish branch of City Bank Europe which Wise used in DKK as their bank.\nThen the trap sprung. Wise announced the following 2 days that there had been some delays and that the money would soon be in my account.\nd.02.09 2022 Notified Wise that the account was closed. They closed the possibility for me to complain do to the fact they closed my email account, so my options to claim my money back were not possible. I found an access to write to their Support, got a ticket no 22767452\nThey would reply within 2 days. They just never answered back. Now 1 month later I have heard nothing. 04.09.2022 I got a total of 1,004,10 including fees back But the DDK 5,000 I transferred from my own bank account to Wise's bank in DK I never came back. City Bank Europe has confirmed this to my bank that Wise have withdraw my money I send to them. CITY Bank now in Poland has asked if we have reported WISE to the police? Got a telephone number for WISE in Australia (I have and can provide this by contacting me, to others who have found themselves in a similar situation).\n\n* Wise does not have an official phone number you can call.\n* They do not have an official email address\n* They have a support department where you fill in your email address and what it is about.\n* They just never reply back.\n\n15.09.2022 I have received my WISE Visa Debit card, totally ridiculous it's closed of cource.\n\nSuddently Wise write to me\n\nKXXX (Wise)\nSep 29, 2022, 11:12 GMT+2\n\nHi Flemming,\n \nThanks for reaching out, and sorry for the wait!\n \nWe haven't been able to refund you the money back, due to missing refund banking details. \n \nCan you please share the proof of payment document with us for the 5,000 DKK payment?
