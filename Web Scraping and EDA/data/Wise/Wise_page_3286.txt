We're working towards a free to use product, but we haven't reached this goal just yet. Until then, we'll always disclose our fees before you pay for your transfer and we keep our pricing as transparent (and low) as possible.\n\nWhen adding money to your balances, you can do that two ways. You can use add money button or send the money from your local bank account to your Wise balances. We don't just take money out of your account, you'd need to manually confirm and send us the payment.\n\nAll the best,\nWise Team.", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2021-05-11', 'CompanyReplyTime': '09:12:47'}

Used them for 5 years or so without any problems, but once things did go south (after figuring stuff out on my own, it turned out that I had a problem because I didn’t include two middle names that my recipient almost never uses), they do go south. Pretty much impossible to get through to any support agent that doesn’t just copy and paste canned responses (not to have them escalate to supervisors). One of the Twitter DMs said that they “know how I must feel”, which honestly made me quite infuriated. I got my issue resolved after a couple days or so (I don’t know if my rather curt response implying that I think they’re racially profiling my recipient helped move things forward—perhaps it did).\n\nOverall, they’re still a genuinely good option if you are living in between different countries. They have some cool functions that aren’t available elsewhere. However, things will work well as long as you don’t run into any problems and don’t have to deal with their support desks.
