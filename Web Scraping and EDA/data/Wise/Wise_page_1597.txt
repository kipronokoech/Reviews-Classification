Half the time it works great and the other half of the time it doesn't let me send any money.

I then send screenshots that I have at least 3x the amount I'm transferring available in my account. It would be great to have more transparency.

For some currencies it takes a bit longer to receive it - for example, USD can take up to 4 business days to get to us, depending on how you sent us the money.\n\nIf you see an error message that there are insufficient funds on your card, then make sure to double-check the limits with your bank. This might trigger this error message, but in the end, we simply pull the data from your bank's end.\n\nHope this clarified, but do give us a call: https://wi.se/contactus_ for quicker solution.\n\nThanks,\nWise team", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2022-06-14', 'CompanyReplyTime': '09:25:42'}

It could be because the transfer was set up closer to the weekend/holidays, or because we needed to carry extra checks.\n\nOur teams do have bigger backlogs at the moment, for which we do apologize. It shouldn't take much longer to get an update, so please keep an eye on your emails.\n\nAlso, you do have every right to file a complaint if that's your wish: https://wi.se/complaintsprocedure_\n\nThanks,\nWise team", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2022-06-14', 'CompanyReplyTime': '09:29:18'}
