We understand that account closure is very difficult to deal with. If you had pending payments, they're automatically cancelled and refunded back to you. If you're referring to remaining balances, we work on sending it back but first need to complete due diligence checks.\n\nIt's best to fill out our appeals form and get in touch with our team. They'll ask for your refund details and keep you updated on the status of refund. https://wi.se/appeal\n\nIf you've already gotten in touch with them, they'll continue to send you emails about your case. Just keep an eye on your inbox.\n\nThanks,\nThe TransferWise Team", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2021-01-25', 'CompanyReplyTime': '15:43:58'}
