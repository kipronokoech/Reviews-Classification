Small, fair fees. User friendly, intuitive interface. Nice additional or related features like ability to generate and use virtual cards for online payments on websites or merchants which you don't fully trust. Ability to exchange between currencies (and at a good exchange rate). Ability to set or customise daily or monthly spending limits. Ability to suspend and re-enable use of virtual cards. 2 factor authentication using the Wise app on my phone. Instant notifications to my phone about any spending done with my Revolut physical or virtual cards. 2 factor authorisation of payments.\n\nBut what really convinced me to sign up with Wire (before I knew about all of the other nice things about their services, which I listed above) was the ability to receive wire transfers from US based senders by means of either an ABA routing number or via SWIFT.\n\nThis is exceedingly useful to me and was the first and main reason I signed up for an account with Wise in the first place. Competitors of Wise, at least the ones I was aware of and tested at the time (which included really big names everyone has heard or seen in advertisements by now), didn't offer the option of being able to receive wire transfers from US based senders by means of an ABA routing number and when I discovered Wise does, I ended up only using Wise exclusively (even though I had previously signed up with what probably is Wise's biggest competitor) because there was simply no drawback to using Wise but no other alternative I tried offered the essential feature of being able to receive wire transfers by means of an ABA routing number, which Wise does.\n\nMoreover, I can then send the funds I receive by means of an ABA routing number in the SWIFT system without any problems.\n\nWise will even automatically convert the right amount of funds to my local currency on the fly at checkout when I use my Wise debit card for grocery shopping, if I didn't took the time to exchange some of my foreign currency savings into the local currency. If I did, it will just deduct from the local currency amounts. I don't need to open new, separate accounts or sub-accounts for each new currency I convert to. I don't need to specify the currency when making a payment in a particular currency. My reserves of the specific currency the seller is demanding payment in will be drawn upon automatically, without me needing to select or specify that.\n\nAnd last but not least, the debit card they sent me is a wonderful, understated minimalist design is quite unique/distinctive and which I really appreciate.\n\nI cannot name a single fault or unpleasant experience I've had with Wise. I'm really happy with my choice of using Wise. I only hope they'll never slacken. If they just stay the course, I don't think I'll ever need to opt for another online banking or money wire service. Or even need another account with a brick and mortar bank.", 'review_date': '2022-04-21', 'review_time': '17:59:51', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
