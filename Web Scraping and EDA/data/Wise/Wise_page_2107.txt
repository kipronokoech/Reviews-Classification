Set up accounts for myself and my son who is studying abroad. Have had the occasional delay. But overall the service is very reliable. I know some have complained about their verification process but it’s for our own protection. The rates are very good and process is very easy for paying foreign tuition fees or transferring money abroad. And now that the Wise debit card is available in Canada, it’s an even better experience. So much better than costly international transfers through the banks which take days. Longest money transfer has taken with Wise was a day. The only complaint is that I cannot connect my US currency account in Canada to Wise (it requires a US account from US).
