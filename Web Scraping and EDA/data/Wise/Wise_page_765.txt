I am thankful I received it. I was stuck without it. Wise has been important for me. Without it, I really wouldn\'t be able to book hotel rooms overseas or buy stuff without going to the ATM every time. Unfortunately, overseas ATM fees from Wise are expensive. I came back to Trustpilot to update this review. Deduct 1 star for scaring me with the 2 days\' transfer. /// Original post: On 14 November 2022 Monday, I transferred $3200 Singapore dollars (SGD) from my Singapore bank account via PayNow UEN to my Wise SGD account. Using PayNow UEN was always instant transfer. But on 14 November, the $3200 didn\'t appear in my Wise account after transferring. The Wise system says the amount is "Adding" and "we are waiting for your money". I have the bank e-mail that says the $3200 was successfully transferred to Wise Asia-Pacific Pte Ltd. Yet I am not seeing the amount in my Wise balance. It is also not back in my bank account. Wise has become a fraud. When I e-mailed Wise, the reply was it takes time for the transfer. And when I went to Wise Facebook, an unidentified person who replied with the Wise logo told me to provide my e-mail, my phone number, my country of residence. For "communication issues". Then he/she told me to download the Remitly app: "We shall need to track your funds please and this will be done through Remitly app". I said Remitly and Wise are 2 different companies. "We need to authenticate via Remitly please" "We need to track via Remitly". After that, he/she didn\'t care about my concerns, and kept telling me to download the Remitly app. And wanted me to "Login into your wise account and take a screenshot of". A screenshot of what, I don\'t know since the person stopped there. And the person typed and disappeared, typed and disappeared.
