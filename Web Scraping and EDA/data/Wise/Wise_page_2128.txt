When I switched over to a business to business transaction, I got a message saying that they needed to do a review before sending the money and that it could be up to 4 days.\n\nA few days later, they asked for more information on why I was sending the money for what they claimed was sanction reasons. I had already provided that information to someone who I had reached out to about the delays.\n\n11 days after the transfer, I tried to cancel and they said it again had to go though email to a special team and that it would take "about 2-5 working days or more" just to cancel the transfer.\n\nThe service came recommended to me by a business colleague but I am moving on to other options.\n\nEdit:\nTo the response from wise - Carrying out checks is one thing but it shouldn\'t take two weeks or more after I have given you the information when the note on the account and the customer service reps say it should be done in less than 4 days.\n\nI also requested that the transfer be cancelled and I was told that it would be but that it would take another 4 or 5 days at minimum because the person I was talking to had to send an email to another department. The cancellation never happened and the money finally sent after close to a month meaning that my consultant got paid double and causing me more headaches.\n\nThe problem is not the check but the poor quality of your service and lack of responsiveness for things that should be automated like cancelling a transaction.\n\nI will not be using you in the future and I would advise others to find other alternatives as well.\n\nBy the way, some banks will offer preferred exchange rates if you give them a call and the wire transfer fee is about the same as the Wise transfer fee if you are moving large sums of money.', 'review_date': '2022-03-29', 'review_time': '04:26:29', 'CompanyReply': 'Reply from Wise\nMar 28, 2022\nHello Jeremy,\n\nWhile our goal is to complete all payments as fast as we can, we‚Äôre a regulated financial institution and as such, we need to carry extra checks on transfers from time to time.
