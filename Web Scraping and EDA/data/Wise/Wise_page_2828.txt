I'd already set up a GBP & EUR account within Wise, and I'd also set up my UK current account, and my French Bank current account as 'Recipients' in Wise. No hassle doing either of these things.\n\nOnly difficulty sending money to my Wise GBP account, (sort code & account number given once verified), was from Virgin Money, not Wise. (Virgin Money has really aggressive Fraud limits on sending money to anyone !! Locked my account to stop me doing so)\n\nI wish I'd sent it to my Wise account from within Wise itself, 'ADDing' money using my Debit Card instead (Virgin Money admitted they wouldn't have blocked my account for that - how stupid can you get) - I've not checked if there is a charge within Wise for adding money via a Debit Card, but I'd assume there will almost definitely be one adding money form a Credit Card.\n\nOnce the money was within Wise, transfers showed up within minutes, quicker than I'd expected.\nI then waited for the GBP to EUR exchange rate to rise (watching Exchangerates.org.uk) and just converted ¬£5600 to Euros within seconds, cost ¬£19.53, exchange rate just slightly above the watched interbank rate as well, this gave me ‚Ç¨6515.03 exch rate 1.1674, and then I payed it to my 'recipient' French Bank account, which cost all of ‚Ç¨0.28.\nTotal Cost of transferring money from UK to France less than ¬£20, all at a better exchange rate than any of the competitors (checked via currency exchange rate sites).\n\nIt also appeared in my French bank account by the time I'd opened up the website and logged in, Brilliant !\n\nSo, the conclusion is, if you can actually get past any verification hurdle, Wise is an easy, very quick way to send money to France (haven't any need to send elsewhere)\n\nReview would have been 5 stars if not for verification issues.", 'review_date': '2021-09-09', 'review_time': '09:48:54', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
