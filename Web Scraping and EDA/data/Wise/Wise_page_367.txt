I am going to use the name Strip in this review because I had the same issue with Stripe but they contacted me the correct way to let me know what was wrong, my account was restricted but they did give me the chance to correct the issue and when that was done my account was reinstated immediately. It took less than 2 days. Wise did not even contact me, just an email with your account is closed. I never in the past went against guidelines. I love Wise but never expected this. I recently registered a company in the UK just to make doing business easier. And now Wise pulls this. Wise I want my account reinstated and my business account enabled. I don't want to wait 30 days for an email on an appeal because this was a simple issue especially if you had checked with me first. I send 2 appeals and also mailed them because I want this issue FIXED. If this is done I will gladly update my review. I had already given up the service that created the issue when Stripe contacted me. It was not worth losing my account for so I gave it up.I can live without that service.", 'review_date': '2023-04-28', 'review_time': '15:34:06', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
