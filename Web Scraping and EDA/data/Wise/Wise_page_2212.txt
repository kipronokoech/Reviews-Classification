However the last few times I’ve used the service I’ve found that the amount I had transferred had changed. The reason for this is that Wise have changed the period of time that they guarantee the rate of exchange. Previously it was 24 hours. Leaving sufficient time for money to be transferred to the Wise account and the transfer on to remain exact. However, I have since discovered that the guaranteed rate has decreased to 2 hours. Leaving insufficient time for bank transfers to be made, resulting in amounts changing only when Wise transfers the money on. When I say insufficient time I mean 6 or 8 hours. As a customer you only find out once you receive the email confirmation of transfer with a changed rate. Highly disappointing and rather frustrating.\nWise was a service I had been totally satisfied with, however my confidence in the guaranteed rate has now plummeted and I think I’ll be looking to another service to replace Wise.
