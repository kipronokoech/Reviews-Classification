Said I had exceeded an annual limit. Customer service had NO idea. After 24 hours they tell me their is a temporary stop and, ni idea why and they have NO idea how long it will take, so suggest I send £ to pay Euros. This defeats the WHOLE use of WISE to me. . I now have Euros in my account that I cannot access. So customer service is VERY poor. Will stop using and move to better providers. 5 days later no response Not good enough', 'review_date': '2022-06-15', 'review_time': '07:27:43', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nJun 15, 2022\nHi Carla,\n\nAppreciate your feedback about this. This might happen depending on where you're located, and the local regulations. This is something we can't change from our side due to how we're regulated.\n\nIt seems that the only workaround, for now, would be to convert the money to another currency, as we've already mentioned to you. We don't want to cause you any extra hassle, but it's understandable if you wish to move to another provider, as we can't offer you EUR payments in this year.\n\nYou're more than welcome to give us a call for a quicker resolution: https://wi.se/contactus_\n\nWise team", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2022-06-15', 'CompanyReplyTime': '10:50:50'}
