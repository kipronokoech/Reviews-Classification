When it does, you'll see it in your activity list too. How long it takes for the funds to arrive depends on the transfer method and currency you receive.\n\nIf it's been longer than this, send us a proof of payment, so we can check it. More info about this here: https://wi.se/howlongpaymentsbalance\n\nIf you have more questions, or need help, reach out to us at: https://wi.se/contactus, or send us a private message on X (Twitter), Facebook, or Instagram. Be sure to include your email and user number, so we can dig into the case ASAP.\n\nWise", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2023-10-11', 'CompanyReplyTime': '08:00:51'}
