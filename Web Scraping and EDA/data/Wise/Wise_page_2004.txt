The form the link leads to is unclear leading to many new users of Wise making mistakes. The first page of the form is 'Sending currency'. Many think this is the currency they will be sending!. And then it means they can't pick the same currency in arriving currency part of the form which comes next. The form should tell them it's not allowed to send the same currency from that link and tell them how they should do that instead, or simply allow to send the same currency. But it doesn't and it leads to me getting EUR transfers so many times instead of GBP, and ppl sending to me having to exchange from e.g. USD to GBP only to have it converted into EUR before arriving at me, and I then have to convert back to GBP. annoying and not user-friendly.", 'review_date': '2022-03-25', 'review_time': '13:25:48', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

Bear in mind that the receiving bank may charge fees to receive payments sent with SWIFT. In addition, you might be charged by any banks that handle the money along the way. We don’t have control over when these fees are charged, or how much they cost.\n\nWe have a cost to process your payment, and this is reflected in our fees. We're working towards a free to use product, but we haven't reached this goal just yet. Until then, we'll always disclose our fees before you pay for your transfer, and we keep our pricing as transparent (and low) as possible.\n\nWise", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2022-04-29', 'CompanyReplyTime': '08:55:52'}
