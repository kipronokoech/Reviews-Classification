It could be because the transfer was set up closer to the weekend/holidays, or because we needed to carry extra checks. You can read about it here: https://wi.se/howlongdoesatransfertakes\n\nIt's important to keep in mind that majority of banks only move your money during normal banking hours. And things may take a little longer for the money to get to us if the country youâ€™re sending from has a national holiday, or it's a weekend.\n\nWise", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2022-09-19', 'CompanyReplyTime': '08:54:57'}
