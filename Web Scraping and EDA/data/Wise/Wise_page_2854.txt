They no longer guarantee rates 24 hours. You have to keep money with them in order to do that. For transfers from your bank to another - forget it. Rate will change, amounts will change and your recipient will not receive the amount requested. They “offer” even better rates now! But only if you keep your money with them. So - buyer beware! I’ve changed to Revolut, and my recommendation is that others do too. Customer service was terrible as well - as a long time client, not even an “we’re sorry, here’s 3 euros as a token of your loyalty”. No, because they took an additional 3 euros, I have to do another transfer of THREE euros! Truly, just steer clear.
