I had used international wire transfers through my bank for many years with the anxiety of the money potentially not arriving for weeks, not to mention the cost. And then more recently I spent over a month trying to open an account with another international money transfer platform that ultimately worked, but was again quite costly.\n\nThen I found Wise. I was able to open an account in less than five minutes and within a short time had attached my bank accounts and was initiating an international transfer. The cost associated with the transfer was upfront and easy to understand and my money transfers have all completed in no more than 2 working day. One of my transfers even completed in less than 24 hours.\n\nThank you Wise!', 'review_date': '2022-07-20', 'review_time': '14:03:14', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
