I paid with dollars from my U.S. bank account. Almost at the end, Wise asked me for my password, as an extra level of security. Since I had earlier provided my Wise password, I thought you were asking for the password for my bank account. Now if I’d thought about this for a minute, I would have realized that you wouldn’t be asking for the password for my bank account, but since I was at the point that you were confirming my use of my bank account to fund the transaction, that’s what I thought you were asking for. So I entered my bank account password (twice), and then I switched successfully to my Wise password. To avoid the likelihood of confusing your customers, here’s a suggestion:\n\nDon’t say “Enter your Password”.\nInstead say “Enter your Wise Password”.', 'review_date': '2022-09-30', 'review_time': '05:16:04', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
