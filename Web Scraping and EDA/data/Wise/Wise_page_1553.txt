All very transparent!\n\nA couple of things to note, and the reason it’s not a full five stars.\n\n1) As of May 2022, If you hold more than 3,000€ in the account they charge you a % fee. This is a new thing and has discouraged me from using Wise for all my banking needs. A real shame.\n\n2) Some utility companies and the government of Spain will not accept Wise Direct Debits. This is a pain of course and another reason why all my banking isn’t solely with Wise.\n\n3) They use Plaid to verify ACH transfers which is great. Accept my bank does not use Plaid so I have to pay more to credit my account which is ludicrous!\n\nOther than those three negatives it’s perfect.

{'platform': 'Wise', 'id': '62afcc2c787382efe21165d9', 'stars': 1, 'title': 'Prepare for the Worst.', 'message': "I attempted to transfer money from my UK bank account to Wise and onward to my wife's US dollar account in Laos. I've done this many times and it's worked perfectly. Until 18th May, after not receiving the transfer I emailed Wise who told me that my transfer was delayed for 5-7 days for Checks and Review of the account, they said it was to meet Regulatory compliance and recent Sanctions busting legislation. They said the transfer was selected at random and it was a rare and unusual occurrence. My wife needed the $500 to pay our builders an interim payment. I had to contact Wise who advised that they may take 2 days to answer my email. I sent numerous emails asking pertinent questions. I never got a proper reply to my questions, I got ignored or evasive answers. Eventually I was advised that it would be 10 days, which disappeared and was replaced by 15 days. Wise continued to say, wait for an email from us and they couldn't say when it was going to arrive. They wouldn't say what Checks or review was checking or reviewing. Their specialist team don't communicate with customers or Wise customer service. After not receiving the transfer I sent another transfer through, this was also held up, which shows it's not a random selection of a transfer it's a targeted selection of the account. I found out that it's a common occurrence and there is a Facebook page offering help and support to victims of Wise. There are thousands of people who have been robbed by Wise. They aren't a Bank, they don't answer questions, they delay and obfuscate. After 18 days they completed the transfer, they had never answered my questions. So I don't know what regulations they were implementing, from what country or to what purpose. I have no idea what information they were seeking. I don't know who their Financial Director is, his phone or email contact details. I'm not a dodgy money laundering person, I'm just an ordinary guy, I don't transfer large amounts of money, or very often, it always comes from my UK bank account. It always goes to my wife's Laos bank account. I'm not a Russian oligarch. Wise transfer works well until it doesn't, then you can do nothing, they don't meet their obligations to take a reasonable time to carry out their Checks and Reviews. They certainly don't carry them out without a transfer to hold up. They don't explain anything. What they say is not true. They have an appallingly bad lack of Customer Service and the Social media people are always referring to your PM they just sent, which tells you to wait for your email. So they are totally ineffective. Is Wise a Ponzi scheme? I don't know. They told me that they don't make any money from my delayed transfer, they say they don't make any money from holding my money. All financial institutions make money 'on deposit', but Wise say they don't. Do I believe anything they say? No I don't. Use this Wise at your own risk.", 'review_date': '2022-06-20', 'review_time': '03:23:56', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
