While our goal is to complete all payments as fast as we can, we’re a regulated financial institution and as such, we need to carry extra checks on transfers from time to time. This is a routine procedure to help us ensure we’re keeping our platform safe for everyone using (including you) while complying with local regulations.\n\nSpeed is always our priority, but so is diligence. Depending on the case, it can take from hours to several days. Do keep in mind, we always make sure to update you along the way, and you’ll know the status of your transfer at all times.\n\n\nWise', 'CompanyReplyDate': '2022-09-27', 'CompanyReplyTime': '10:52:55'}

Then i\'ve been told via an email that my money will be remain in stuck for 60 working days so they can check any "due diligence". It\'s been almost 4 months and i haven\'t heard a single word from wise that when will i receive my money. I still can not believe at this day and age a company who claim to be number 1 at transferring funds treat their customer so poorly.
