Their instructions were not clear and this caused unnecessary stress. They asked me to provide ID of a fellow director, living abroad, who was on holiday at the time, or they would freeze the business account - again all within the 2 week deadline. After countless emails I finally managed to satisfy Wise on all points but it left me anxious. After all, if Wise can freeze an business account with ridiculously short notice periods, this could cause major financial problems. I could get sued for failing to respect contracts.\n\nHaving said that, Wise was always courteous and helpful, and the problem was resolved despite communication problems. And the end result is that I have all my accounts under one profile which makes things much easier.
