The result was, that after a month of trying to make one simple transfer work, they charged me to get access to the amounts they had asked me to move into the transfer-wise account for me to be verified ??????? And then when I told them that they had told me to transfer this money, why are they charging me to access it, they said that it was my fault, and they never said that, and that I didnt know what I was doing and they cant waive the fees. Unprofessional, rude, horrific customer service, I think they make money of off those amounts that they charge people. Stay away, I wouldn't be surprised if this was fraud.\nAnd they keep telling me below the review that it is a requirement, but what they’re not responding to, is since it is a requirement, why do they charge fees to extract the money? So they require you to add money, but then they charge you if you want to take it back. They probably make a few thousand dollars a day pulling this scam", 'review_date': '2020-10-26', 'review_time': '15:29:07', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nOct 26, 2020\nHi Anna.\n\nThe 20 USD top up is to verify your balance and gain access to your USD details. Once money is deposited in your balance, this will activate it so you can get bank details. This will give you unique details for that USD balance, and you can share them with anyone who would like to send you money.\n\nWe need your ID, address, etc for verification of your identity. That's another thing. I can see that my colleague explained everything in detail for you via email but, please, feel free to contact us by using this link here -> wi.se/contactus if you still have any questions.\n\nThanks\n\nJoao", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2020-10-26', 'CompanyReplyTime': '13:39:08'}
