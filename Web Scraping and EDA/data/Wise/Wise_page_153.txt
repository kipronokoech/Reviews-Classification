While we don't offer tracking numbers, we strive to provide accurate delivery estimates. Sometimes, however, circumstances beyond our control can cause delays.\n\nIf your card hasn't reached you yet, we recommend a few steps to expedite the process:\n\n- Double-check that the delivery address is correct\n- Consider contacting your nearest postal office, as sometimes packages might be held there.\n- Patience is key – it's advised to wait up to 6 working days beyond the estimated delivery date.\n- Should you prefer, you can also order a new card by referring to this link: https://wi.se/mywisecardhasntarrived\n\nWe sincerely want to resolve this for you. You're welcome to get in touch with us through various channels.

It helps us combat money laundering, and keep everyone’s money safe. That way we can keep providing you even faster, cheaper and more transparent service.\n\nThat's not all – we also have different regulatory requirements in different regions. Because of this, we might need to ask more, or different, questions, depending on where you move money to or from, or where you live.\n\nFor more info about which documents we accept, check this: https://wi.se/getverifiedguide\n\nNow, the verification can be triggered during a specific transfer, which is why it's possible you hadn't undergone through such process with your first transaction.\n\nIt seems our team has been in contact with you via email today, 1st of August, with more details about your case, and some instructions to follow.
