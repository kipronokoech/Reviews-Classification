We get this rate from Reuters – and they update it in real-time, during the trading market opening hours. You can read more here: https://wise.com/gb/mid-market-rate\n\nWe use a guaranteed rate for every single transfer. A guaranteed rate is exactly what it sounds like: an exchange rate that’s guaranteed for a specified period of time.\n\nOnce you’ve finished setting up your transfer, you’ll need to send your money to us right away, so that we receive it on time. As long as you do, you’ll get that rate locked in.\n\nIf your money doesn’t reach us in time, we’ll still convert and send it as soon as possible. But we’ll use the mid-market rate instead.\n\nIt's always good to compare, and here you can find a tool that helps compare the rates from different service providers: https://wi.se/comparerates\n\nWise", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2023-10-24', 'CompanyReplyTime': '14:32:04'}
