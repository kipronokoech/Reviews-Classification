I have lost over 2000 Euros. A transaction of around 1200 Euros I could stop. But Wise has done nothing to help me. There is no direct phone line for fraud investigation. You can only email them and then you need to wait 24 hours or longer to receive a reply. No emergency response from Wise! This can go on for days and weeks as noone feels responsible for my case. The safety measures of Wise are non-existing. The fraudsters surpassed the 2FA with ease. Noone at Wise feels responsible. I will need to file a complaint via Ombudsman and my local Consumer Rights organisation. It is the worst costumer care I have ever experienced. Please people be careful out there. Your money is NOT safe with Wise! Also most reviews on here about Wise are *invited* writers!

You should be able to see all fees and conversion rates before you pay for the transfer.
