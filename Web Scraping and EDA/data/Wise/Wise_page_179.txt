In this case, we recommend reaching out to the sender directly for more information about the status of the payment. They should be able to provide you with updates on when you can expect to receive the money.\n\nIf the transfer has already been completed, you can request the sender to provide you with a receipt. They can generate a receipt for you by visiting this link: https://wi.se/getpdfreceipt_. This document can help your bank locate the money.\n\nAlternatively, you can ask the sender to contact us with the transfer number, and we'll be more than happy to investigate the case. Please bear in mind that due to privacy and security reasons, we can only disclose transaction details to the person who initiated the transfer.\n\nIn case they sent the money to your Wise account, then we'll need you to send us a proof of payment. You can provide a receipt, bank statement, or even a screenshot from an online bank that includes the following details:\n\n👉 Sender's name and account details\n👉 Your name and account details\n👉 Date of the money transfer\n👉 Amount that was sent\n\nYou can conveniently upload the document here: https://wi.se/senddocument_\n\nIf you have any other questions or concerns, reach out to us here: https://wi.se/contactus_ or on Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram.

This is a routine procedure to help us ensure we’re keeping our platform safe for everyone using (including you) while complying with local regulations.\n\nSpeed is always our priority, but so is diligence.
