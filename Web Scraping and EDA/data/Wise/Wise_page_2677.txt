I truly can't say enough good things about them or the service they provide.\n\nMy daughter and her family live in Spain… permanently. I travel to see them about 4 times a year so using and spending euros is part of my normal existence now. Pre-Wise I had gotten used to exorbitant bank fees whenever I charged anything or took money from an ATM in Spain. Occasionally I would use my daughter as my “bank” and she would change my money for me; but then she would wind up with American cash that she couldn’t use and I’d be walking around with large amounts of cash which is NEVER a good idea when traveling. Then I heard about Wise.\n\nIt’s like having a global bank account! When I’m in Spain I use my Wise card and spend in euros. If I have a layover at Heathrow I can use my card to spend in pounds. And in the U.S. it uses good old American dollars. So simple and the fees are the lowest you’ll find. You simply apply for the Wise card, transfer money into it from your bank account and you’re good to go! Within the app you can convert your dollars to euros, pounds, or just about any currency you can think of. Wise converts if instantly for a tiny fee and then you can use the card in any country for which you now have currency without any additional fees and NO hassle.\n\nI feel like a citizen of the world with my Wise card and it has saved me a ton of money. I cannot recommend Wise highly enough.
