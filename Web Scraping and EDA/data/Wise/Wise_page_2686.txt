I had to wire transfer a fairly decent amount of money to my lawyer in Bologna Italy from the US. But after setting everything up and trying to initiate the transfer I got a message that said they were unable to transfer to this recipient. At first they tried to blame me for not having the correct information. So I reconfirmed. Everything was right. Then they told me that because of certain countries having certain laws it prevents them from doing the transfer. Maybe but not with Italy. Then I could wait no longer for a solution and I went with Xe. I again asked them if there were regulations stopping them from transfering the money to this recipient then why is my bank and Xe able to do it? Their response was, "Unfortunately we\'re unable to give further information regarding the reason. We will not be able to process any payments to that recipient." I mean really?
