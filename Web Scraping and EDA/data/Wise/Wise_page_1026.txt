However, end of July a transaction that had been processed mid May appeared all of a sudden again in my account as open and needing my attention. At this point it looked like someone hacked into my account and initiated that transfer. Only after several emails back and forth with Wise support (it took on average five days to get responses) it could be established that this was actually an old transaction that was reopened due to some system fault. Up to now (end of September) this transaction still shows as pending... This makes me really insecure about the reliability of Wise's system and avoid to keep large amounts and do bigger transfers on Wise.
