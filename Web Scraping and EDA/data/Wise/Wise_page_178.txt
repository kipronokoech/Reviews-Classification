When you open a bank account, you usually need to provide documents to verify details about yourself. Wise is no different. We’re a regulated financial institution, and verification is how we keep your money safe, and comply with the financial regulations in the countries we operate in.\n\nWe do our best to complete verification as soon as possible, and it’s usually done within 2 – 4 working days. In rare cases, it might take longer if we need additional information, but we’ll always let you know if that’s the case.\n\nWe appreciate you taking the time to share the feedback.\n\nWise", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2023-07-26', 'CompanyReplyTime': '07:12:31'}
