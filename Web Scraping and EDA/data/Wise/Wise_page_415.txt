Sending money from Norway to Colombian bank account. Was some problems the first year, (not Wise's fault, but the partner in Colombia). Now transfer goes smoothly\n\nI also use Wise debit card and this has really been working very good. Paying with the card in shops and hotels is especially a good option. Very low fees when paying for stuff in shops or online. I also really like the option to easily freeze or unfreeze my card\n\nATM withdraws also works fine but the only negative thing here it that after the 200 EU monthly limit there's extra fees. Not very high, but still so high that I prefer to use a card from my Norwegian bank after withdrawing 200 EU a month with the Wise card\n\nThe possibility to get up to 3 digital card is another very useful thing with Wise. These cards can be frozen or replaced very easily in the app. Very convenient to ensure your money is safe\n\nAll I all; very happy with Wise", 'review_date': '2023-04-04', 'review_time': '14:04:06', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
