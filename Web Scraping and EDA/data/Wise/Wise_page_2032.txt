{'platform': 'Wise', 'id': '6235699b924ebaa0caf074d0', 'stars': 4, 'title': '- The transfer rate seems unbeatable', 'message': "- The transfer rate seems unbeatable. Even though others announce better deals, when you compare them at the moment you want to transfer, you will receive more with wise.\n- Wise is very honest and upfront with all the fees. You get what they say, as long as your money is already in your balance. I could imagine that taking it directly from your account outside Wise might end up once in a while in a delay that could be related to the bank, but then the announced exchange rate might change!\n- Documents are scanned and verified within minutes. I have never experienced such a fast service!\n- The setting up of an account is nonetheless not as easy as it may seem. There are little twists in it where it would be good to have someone to ask or more detailed advice. F.e. for your first transfer in Eur you get a TransferWise account no. in Belgium. I assumed that was my personal account no. and did the transfer without adding my name; thus the transfer went on an Odyssey and arrived only after 6 days. I could imagine that adding the name in would help assign the money to the personal account.\n- The list of reasons for setting up this account is not broad enough, none of the items really matched my situation. I would suggest the category “others”. It could then be asked for specification, if needed.\n- So far, any further transfer went fine, as , when finally registered and acknowledged, you get an account with your name on it.\n- If you transfer money from your balance the transfer to the recipient happens the same day (I did that from Euro to Ca) - this is unbeatable!\n- There is no number to reconcile the sent and received transaction. Thus, if you get the same sum twice you are not able to tell which of the 2 transaction this money comes from. That should be improved.\n- Wise should advise us that a transfer to wise from your credit card is treated by the bank as a cash withdrawal. A cash withdrawal on a credit card has to be paid immediately and will only be recognized as covered when you paid all the other credit card debts off before. If you don't do that you might have enormous interest to pay, not only on the amount of the wise transfer, but on the complete sum that you owe on the credit card. I was lucky, as my statement came a day after, and I had only made a tiny transfer.", 'review_date': '2022-03-19', 'review_time': '05:26:51', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
