In the beginning, wise was a really good option and I even was invited to share my experience giving them an interview. However they got exponentially worse over time. It is a shame.\nRecently, I convinced two friends to open a wise account, using my invite link and both of them used it, but only one was linked to my account. We contacted them and they told me they couldn't link her account to mine.\nBesides that, the worst part is that these friends keep having problems abroad, with their account blocked after using their debit card. Thankfully I was always with them and could help.\nAgain, about the link the rules are not clear and every time you contact them, you get a different explanation. For example, these friends didn't get the first transfer discount, as promised.\nThe hundred times verification they require to transfer money. It is a complete nightmare.\nAnd also happened that they changed the fare during the process of adding money. Wise fares are not as competitive as they used to be and depending on the currency you need there are better options.\nI will never recommend wise to anyone else, on the contrary, I strongly recommend people not using wise.", 'review_date': '2022-09-09', 'review_time': '09:48:31', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nUpdated Sep 13, 2022\nHello, Pollina\n\nThanks for the feedback.\n\nThe Invite Program your account is linked to is 3 for £50, meaning you will receive a 50 GBP bonus when 3 friends invited by you make a transfer of at least 250 EUR each (or the equivalent in other currency).\nPlease note that the transfer must be between different currencies (eg transfers from EUR to EUR do not qualify) and it will only be considered valid after the transaction is completed.\nIt looks like your friend didn't use your invite link when creating the account.
