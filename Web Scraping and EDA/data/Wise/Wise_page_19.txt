From emails they direct you to messenger chat via a code, to be able to reach an agent, but they have now blocked me from both the FB page and the messenger chat, and their email customer service does not reply at all.\nOh and this is interesting - in the past days there are new reviews here, where they invited people to give them 5 stars. Just go on their Facebook page and check out the hundreds of complaints written under each of their posts. WISE is not worth 4.2 points on Trustpilot. More like 1.0.\nI heard they have done this with numerous people, someone waited 2 months, after they closed her account with over 10.000 euros on it, and she had to beg for months to get her money back.\nThis app is not safe for people to use, because this kind of customer handling is outrageous for a financial institution.\nHow is this allowed within the EU?", 'review_date': '2023-10-26', 'review_time': '17:48:56', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

After a coworker recommended it, I signed up for a Wise account last week. I went through the verification process, uploading both my passport and driver's license. I then initiated an ACH transfer of $20 from my personal US bank account to Wise.\n\nA couple of days later, I tried to check the transfer status using the mobile app, but I was forcibly logged out. When I attempted to log in on my laptop to investigate, I received a message stating that my account had been deactivated. There was no explanation, no email notification — nothing. So, I hit the appeal button to start the appeal process, which requested my driver's license and a selfie holding that license. I assumed it was related to the verification process, so I provided the requested information.\n\nStrangely, yesterday morning, I received an email from Wise, stating that they had decided not to reactivate my account, and the decision was final. They referenced section 25.2 of their Customer Agreement as the reason. The peculiar thing is, there is no section 25.2 in the Customer Agreement, which leads me to suspect that the decision was arbitrary, and the reason given was simply fabricated.\n\nWhile having a Wise account would have been a nice addition, it's not a necessity for me. My experience with them has not been positive, but there are alternative solutions available. As for Wise, I definitely would not recommend it.\n\nI may consider taking additional actions with regulators to ensure that my information with Wise was not compromised or phished.", 'review_date': '2023-10-26', 'review_time': '15:44:21', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

I used it to send payment to 1 business supplier and to my overseas girlfriend.\n\nI then tried to make my usual transfers. Wise took the money from my account, but didn't send it onto the recipient. When I asked why they sent a copy and paste reply saying they were doing “due diligence checks”. I understand they are a regulated company and have to do checks to make sure everything is legitimate.\n\nBut they did not engage with me at all. They didn’t ask me any questions or for any proofs of who I was sending the transfer to. When I tried to message them I just got a generic copy and paste reply.\n\nThen after 1 month they shut my account down. They didn’t even have the courtesy to tell me they were doing this – I only found out when I tried to log in. They give me no explanation as to why they have done this. We all know wise customer service is designed to be terrible. But what sort of utterly appalling person at wise thinks this is an acceptable way to treat a customer? To not even have the most basic courtesy to tell me what’s happening to my account is beyond belief.\n\nI understand they must do checks.
