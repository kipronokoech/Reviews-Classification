First I‚Äôll talk about their money transferring, it‚Äôs unreliable and inconsistent, at random when you send money out of no where they will ask for documents that are absolutely ridiculous, I understand that they need certain documents for security reasons but i swear to you it‚Äôs like they lose all common sense and ask for documents unrelated to the matter, and when you do provide those documents you are waiting for only God knows with their slow emails and their stupid robots on their social media that they beg you to message, their fees compared to other money transfer companies are on the high end, second of all is their personal banking account but i do not understand why on earth they call themselves a bank, the layout of their app is like something a kid could draw, 2 free monthly atm withdrawals i mean like i said you have so many better alternatives that do these things for free all the time, when you have a low balance they app spams you with notifications like your account is low please topup, and surprise surprise topping up costs money we know the account is low and we don‚Äôt care, even if we did care how about telling us how much is left in the account instead of askingw us to topup but the main reason I decided to leave this bank for good is just the customers services and chargeback disputes, I am a reseller so i buy things and i sell it to other people, source what people are looking for etc and theres sometimes problems with me buying things , like orders never arriving and getting fake goods, I purchase various things through 3 main banking apps, Wise, my state owned bank and recently Revolut, i ordered some items from nike, it was a huge haul i mainly used rev and ordered a couple on wise, the items never arrived which is fine, i reached out to the seller they told me they would investigate the matter and later on sent me an affidavit, i filled it out no problem sent everything they asked for and got no further response i went to wise and rev and told them what happened, sent them both the exact same documents and conversations and awaited a response, rev responded within hours and raised the dispute to the card scheme, wise took 7 days to respond with ‚Äúno official letterhead on the affidavit‚Äù and was not purchased in my name so it didnt look authorised, so they wanted me to ask a multi billionaire company to change their entire affidavit format because some unknown bank doesnt know what an affidavit is? Like i said i got 0 issues with rev and i had been using rev for no more than 3 months but wise was hitting me with this? I told them that was just utter nonsense and they told me they could dispute the dispute i told them to and then another 7 days later they came up with some rubbish of its not in your name so it wasn‚Äôt authorised i went on twitter to face even more useless amatuers who didnt know what to do so i closed my wise account, like i said earlier they are so many better alternatives than these amateurs, they really thought that by changing from TransferWise to Wise they could do something, stay away and trust your money with other companies, wise have no clue how to do anything', 'review_date': '2023-11-02', 'review_time': '19:08:10', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
