{'platform': 'Wise', 'id': '5f9bd04b5e693f06f8755941', 'stars': 5, 'title': 'Sending money is stressful, Transferwise makes it less so, and cheaper', 'message': "Clicking send on a large sum of money, sending into the netherworld of wire transfers before it reaches the other end of the darkness is an incredibly stressful thing to do. We sent money from our accounts in the US to Europe, where we bought a house, and the banks were offering rates and fees that were incredibly high and opaque. They offer a degree of security, right? They're fast at least, right? Perhaps, but I'm glad I didn't need to find out, as I trusted Transferwise to help me with this unfamiliar process.\n\nThe rates on Transferwise are very competitive, the fees reasonable, and thankfully they have very empathetic customer service folks who can walk you through a very stressful process (self-induced) if you need it along the way. I was really impressed, I don't normally write reviews of companies anywhere, especially unsolicited ones but I just have to let them know somehow that I was really happy with the whole process. It was a risk to not use the bank to transfer directly, or at least a perceived risk before I used Transferwise, but there was no risk in the end. They saved me money, offered much more helpful customer service than any bank I've dealt with, and were really fast and informative.", 'review_date': '2020-10-30', 'review_time': '08:35:23', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
