Their business practices are not in customer\'s interests, and their customer service response is slow, and basically amounts to "we don\'t care".\n\nThey\'ve responded to my review, telling me to reach out on their socials (but they just have a useless automated chat bot on FB and Twitter), and sent me a link to the same page that I am already getting extremely slow and poor customer service from.\n\nThey are not serious about offering even basic quality of service.', 'review_date': '2023-10-31', 'review_time': '17:08:40', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\n6 days ago\nHey Marcus,\n\nWe appreciate you taking the time to leave us a review. We thrive on feedback, and hearing what our customers think is really important to us.\n\nWe know that this change was extremely short notices, and we're incredibly sorry for any inconveniences that this caused to your personal or business account.\n\nIt's never our intention to cause any stress or trouble for you. We had to make this change due to how we're regulated, but if you were impacted by this, you should now have access to your new USD account details.\n\nIf you need help with this, feel free to reach out to us on our social media channels, or via our contact form here: https://wi.se/contactus We want to make this right for you.\n\nWise", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2023-10-31', 'CompanyReplyTime': '15:44:45'}

This is my central bank account with most of my money.

So, they just don't get the problem and will delete my account in two days. I have no idea where my money will go and I think the only thing I can do is to take legal action and to sue the **** out of them.\nYou definitely have chosen the wrong person for this kind of games.\nYou will loose someone who would have used your service for decades to come through this.\nIf you are considering Wise: DON'T DO IT!", 'review_date': '2023-10-31', 'review_time': '11:43:00', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
