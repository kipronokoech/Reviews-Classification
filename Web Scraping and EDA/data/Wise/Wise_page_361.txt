But for our little non profit organization we can\'t transfer since November and didn\'t get a reply for months, even the website told us, we have submitted the necessary docs.

It stated: "the document you have uploaded cannot be accepted as a Bank statement. Therefore we request you to upload 3-6 months bank statement of your Business account in PDF format to confirm your profile:... Should you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to ask — we’re always happy to help! ..."\nI replied immediately and was asking which kind of records are required: "I’ve sent you all bank records of the last 4 months we have. We are printing them out on a machine in the branch, that’s the old fashioned style and don’t get them in another form. Could you please explain what kind of document you require?" - this was May 1.

That being said, we can ask you to upload a document that proves how you earn your money. This is called your source of wealth, and is a regulatory requirement for some regions.\n\nWe need to see a document to prove that your money comes from where you say it does. Here we also explain what we look for on these documents: https://wi.se/sow_\n\nOnce we got the information we need, we'll do everything in our power to complete the checks, and you'll be able to make transfers again.\n\nThanks for bearing with us.\n\nWise", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2023-05-02', 'CompanyReplyTime': '13:54:50'}
