The verification department and the support team are unqualified.', 'message': 'The worst verification system. The HR department responsible for verifying accounts is the most irresponsible of all the platforms I\'ve used. The support team doesn\'t care about you and will respond to you every 2-3 days, telling you that your problem will be resolved soon.\n\nI am a business owner, I opened a business account. I started accepting payments from customers. I receive a message about the verification of my account. I send documents confirming my income. A few days pass, but there is no result. I ask the support team when the result will be, and they say wait. One day, I log in and see that there is no message on the account header about the verification. I try to make transfers and everything works. I think, finally, they are not limiting my work. Then I receive a message about additional documents, and my account is sent back for verification. I provide them again and just wait for a week. Can you imagine this? When I have a flow of clients, I accept payments, and my bank takes away this opportunity. Despite the fact that I sent all the documents for verification, I was initially confirmed, and then they do this nonsense again. I\'ll go back a little bit, when they sent my account for verification again, and I waited for about a week. Support just shrugged their shoulders and said, "Wait. And today I see a message about the deactivation of my account. The attitude of the support team is as brutal as possible.
