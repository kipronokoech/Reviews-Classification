What can be found there is the guarantee that they will only process the money once they recieve it, when in reality they go ahead and pay out their own money, subsequently threatening to sue if you don‚Äôt pay back for the ‚Äòdebt‚Äô, instead of just declining the transaction which hadn‚Äôt taken place (like every normal institution does when you initiate the transfer for which the funds cannot be drawn). Thus, leaving you with huge transactional and conversion fees which are time consuming as well. When I called, they explained they do it ‚Äúout of courtesy‚Äù üòÉ It‚Äôs as if you came to the store not aware of the insufficient balance on your card, bought a t-shirt, and the store, instead of declining the transaction, payed for you and then asked for their money back.
