No real information is available from customer service except to tell me not to worry, it's normal, we have a high volume of transfers. I don't need to be patronised like this, I need the money to be released. I am a registered business and this is a payment against invoice from another registered business that is a regular client. Such a lack of responsiveness and awareness of customers' needs is completely unacceptable.\nEDIT after Wise reply: I am fully aware of the need for regulatory checks, but proper due diligence would involve asking me for copies of invoices or contracts in relation to this payment, and no information has been requested from me. Wise claim they are updating me and I‚Äôll know the status of my transfer at all times - the updates are merely to say I have to wait, and the status update is ‚ÄòWe need more time to process your transfer‚Äô, which is no help at all.

Funds arrived in our account in Aus dollars and could be instantly converted to Canadian dollars on the Wise app. The app provided Instant updates - every transaction immediately appeared in the app and the account balance was always up to date.
