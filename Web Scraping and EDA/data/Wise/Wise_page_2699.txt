He has now been left with no access to money with which to buy medication or food. Wise are aware that he is unable to do even the most basic shopping. He has not eaten for four days because he lacks the means to obtain food.\n\nAppeals to Wise have fallen on deaf ears.\n\nBe very careful about relying on Wise as your main (or only) source of funds. They simply cannot be relied on.\n\nSince I wrote this review, my son has had further correspondence with Wise as a result of which they have come up with a solution to the problem that caused the closure of his account. They have given him a new account so that he once more has access to his money.\n\nThank you, Wise.', 'review_date': '2021-11-02', 'review_time': '16:46:48', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nNov 2, 2021\nHello, Douglas.\n\nWe are sorry to hear about the situation, but rest assured this isn't a decision we take lightly.\n\nDeactivation can happen for a few reasons, but because of the way we're regulated, we can't share the exact reason why.
