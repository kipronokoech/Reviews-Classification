They are trying to break into business accounts but they cannot handle this at all. A customer paid me a small amount of USD and Wise asked me for the name and registered address of the business, no problem, I sent the info. 5 days later, the transfer hadn't arrived and they asked for the same information again. I gave it and asked them to refund the $7.50 fee for the 5 day delay. They effectively told me to get lost, so I closed the account. Maybe they will get there one day but for now - don't use for business.\nP.S. Thanks for your reply (below) but you've missed the point. Having 30 years' experience in financial services I am well aware of regulatory obligations. In this case, however, I supplied the information and you asked for it again 5 days later.
