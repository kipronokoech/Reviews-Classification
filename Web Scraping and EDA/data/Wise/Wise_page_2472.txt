Their phone is "M-F" and "Closed" mind you, it\'s Monday. (and if you\'re in an international company I expect you to be open during your client\'s business hours. I can call GoDaddy at 4 am. WHERE IS WISE\'S PEOPLE? The chat option is gone. The email address is "We no longer answer emails" and the contact form is nonexistent.\n\nWHERE IS MY MONEY? And how can I get help????\n\nAs soon as I figure this out, I\'m canceling my account and flaming them on every social media site I can get on, and I\'m contacting influencer friends with followings to also flame them. I am FURIOUS. Don\'t mess with people\'s money. And if my client can\'t recoup the money cause WHO KNOWS were it is (my client has a receipt saying it was sent) I will lose that money. $1800.00 for a small biz owner IS HUGE MONEY. Wise, go die.

You managed to be the worst/most expensive service in just 2 years.\nPaying my rent via Sepa takes a fee, adding money with a card takes a fee while all used to be for Free and is now for free with Revolut and other services.\n\nToday I contacted you abt my own money that I added with card that should be there instantly and here we go 30 minutes and the money is not there. Your agent did not hesitate to send me the steps to close my account when i asked so, did not apologize, asked me to wait more MAYBE the money should arrive in 10 minutes (LOL) and can not provide a reason why you have been holding my money.

As by default we're dealing with currency conversion, do note that we have small fixed fees for sending the same currency payments. However, we're working hard on bringing them down. Generally, it's our mission to get our fees down to Zero and while it does take some time- we're constantly working on this, by bringing down our pricing whenever possible.\n\nYou can be sure though, that we're always transparent and show you everything upfront- which is not always the case with other providers. You'll also get the real mid-market rate. More about our pricing at:https://wi.se/ourfees_.\n\nYou can also check out our comparison page here:https://wi.se/comparerates_.\n\nWhenever you add money to your account- kindly note that the speed depends on the payment method you've chosen. Card payments are typically faster than bank transfers, but we can't speed up any incoming payments on our end. As soon as your money arrives, we'd notify you on our end.\nAs a regulated institution, we might have to run some regular checks on incoming payments in some cases- which could be one reason your payment took longer. Whenever this happens, we'll try to complete everything as fast as possible.\n\n\nIf you'd like us to look into this, please reach out at:https://wi.se/contactus_. Our support is always more than happy to help out.\n\nBest wishes,\nWise.", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2021-12-31', 'CompanyReplyTime': '10:01:58'}
