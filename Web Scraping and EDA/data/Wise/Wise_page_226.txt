What a colossal disappointment!\n\nI was told on Monday that I would have my refund in 1-2 days. Itâ€™s now Friday and still no refund and not a customer service response in sight. WHERE IS THE REFUND????\n\nIt's mind-boggling how a company can repeatedly fail to deliver on a basic commitment. I was left hanging, desperately waiting for a substantial sum of money to be returned to me. But Wise seemingly has no sense of urgency or responsibility towards its customers.\n\n30+ days without my hard-earned money has caused me endless frustration and financial strain. Wise's incompetence in processing refunds has left a bitter taste in my mouth and a sense of regret for ever choosing their services.\n\nIn short, if you value your time and money, steer clear of Wise. Their inability to deliver a refund within a reasonable timeframe is a clear sign of their disregard for customer satisfaction.\n\nSpare yourself the aggravation and explore alternatives that actually prioritize their customers' financial well-being.", 'review_date': '2023-06-23', 'review_time': '10:44:33', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

Wise processed all and as usual I got confirmation (recipient got confirmation also to his email). As second and third day nothing happened on his account (no money received) he started panicking and I called wise who said the transfer is OK and my friend must have it on his bank account - Wise also claimed there is some fishy in my friends claims ( I also attacked him he is lying to me as Wise was always on time).\nWell, situation actually escalated as I figure out that there is an email in spam from Wise (asking for plenty of extra documents and information), BUT NO information about extra requests in the app (which never happened till now - app is showing that money is sent and even Banking partner reference is included + information that my friend already got funds).\nAfter 2 emails exchanged with Wise, answering them about why and to whom am I sending money, they sent one more email with "hold" information (they still didnt proceed the payment after 5 working days).\n\nSo simply:\n1. App showing money sent and delivered;\n2. App NOT showing any extra demand for info from Wise;\n3. Phone support saying all is fine with transfer and that my friend is "lying" to me;\n3. Got emails from Wise (first one in spam) and excuses they have to follow EU rules and claim I will not be able to use Wise if I dont answer in an exact period;\n4. Money still not arrived (5 working days).\n\nConclusion. Wise is in a big financial problems and they are delaying their transfers with this kind of manipulations. And Wise, please dont answer here you are following all EU rules as we all know you can avoid them!\n\nI am closing account with Wise (also business one) after this transfer is at my friends account (actually I dont trust them it will be actually sent).', 'review_date': '2023-06-23', 'review_time': '07:43:48', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
