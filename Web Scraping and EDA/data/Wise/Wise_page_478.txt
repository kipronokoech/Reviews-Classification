Later when i made the transfer i was shocked to see that my transfer amounts changed automatically as per live rate. Overall i lost on each of the 3 transfers that were done via wise. This has really pissed me off as i wasnt expecting company like wise playing up with transaction rate just because it took me few hours to transfer funds for payment. This is total scam and has really put me off with wise. I will never use wise again after this incident and would use some other platform in future. 1 star to wise for playing up with customers and runnjng scam behind business.', 'review_date': '2023-02-28', 'review_time': '23:32:12', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

Transfers are very quick, there is no paperwork, multiple methods to pay and the exchange rates are very competitive. I have also never experienced any glitches. Yes, sometimes, e.g. when paying with SOFORT banking, transfer times can vary. My understanding, however, is that this is mostly due to the time it takes for the money to arrive at Wise varying rather than a fault on Wise's site itself. So from my side, 5 starts are totally warranted. One thing, I would love to see (but I understand that it probably wouldn't be economic) would be a rewards/points system for people who make many transfers like me, even though I'd always pick cheaper rates over a rewards scheme.", 'review_date': '2023-02-28', 'review_time': '16:38:57', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
