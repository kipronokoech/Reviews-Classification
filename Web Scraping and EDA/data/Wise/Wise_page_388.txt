This isn't something we take lightly. It's normally a result of a conflict with our Terms of Service or Customer Agreement, or due to a discrepancy with a financial law. We can't always share the exact reason for the deactivation, due to how we're regulated.\n\nHowever, you can find some possible reasons here wi.se/accountdeactivation.\n\nWe hear your concern, but rest assured your money is safe. When we close an account with money on it, we need to carry due diligence checks first. Once these checks are completed, we always get in touch about the refund.\n\nDue diligence checks are conducted to verify the information you have provided to us. We are required to do these at all stages of the customer relationship, not just during the initial onboarding stage, so this means during the customer relationship as well as during the deactivation stage.\n\nWe can also give you an update on your appeal if you contact us at https://wi.se/contactus_ or through social media channels (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram).\n\nFurthermore, we appreciate your patience highly.\n\nWise", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2023-04-18', 'CompanyReplyTime': '07:58:24'}
