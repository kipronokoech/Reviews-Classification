Once my bank reached out to Wise, they disabled my ability to fund my account with my card without warning and I could only fund my account with super overpriced wire transfers. I tried funding my account with a wire transfer as I was getting ready to go on summer holiday (was actually at the airport) and needed funds ASAP. The wire transfer was cancelled and the money is nowhere to be found. Then, without asking for information about why I filed the claim they tried to collect the amount I had filed a claim for by stopping me from either funding my account through wire transfer or moving any of my money. Again, without asking for any information from me. Despite me repeatedly explaining the inconvinences I was experiencing due to this, I would only received rude, accusatory replies every other day. This whole dilema left me without access to money during holidays, made me late to pay my rent as well as multiple other expenses I use Wise for.\nAs a business owner of 15+ years, I had never experienced this type of treatment from any of the financial institutions I bank with. Their little power play resulted in a ridiculous amount of fees for me. Please beware that regardless of being a trusted customer, you will be left to fend for yourself which is a frustrating situation.", 'review_date': '2021-08-02', 'review_time': '18:35:20', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nAug 9, 2021\nRest assured, we do our best to help you in every way we can, and it's never our intention to accuse you or cause any hassle.
