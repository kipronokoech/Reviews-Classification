You’ll always see the fee upfront, and only pay for what you use.\n\nOur exchange rate continues to be that of the mid-market.

This morning I received a further email stating:\n"Upon checking, your transfer I can confirm is still waiting to receive the money as we have not yet received on our end. Bank transfers are usually instant, but sometimes they take longer. Some banks only process transfers during weekdays — they might also run some routine checks before sending money to Wise."\n\nWell, obviously this caused me quite some concern as I had written confirmation that the funds had reached Wise. So I sent Wise Support an email explaining the situation, and, of course, received a unhelpful response from their bot. Like many others, I have been unable to contact a human at Wise.\n\nAs it turns out, the transfer was in fact sent some time later, but there is still a duplicate transaction sitting in my account awaiting funds (heaven knows where that came from).\n\nSo, in future, I will be very wary of using Wise and will probably switch my business to Revolut. If you can\'t trust your financial institute with your money, then they are worse than useless.\n\nPostscript: I have now had email responses from a human (I assume) at Wise Support, which went some way to explain what had happened, and I now consider the matter closed.', 'review_date': '2023-06-26', 'review_time': '22:09:58', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

I’m still a bit unsure about the transactions but at least I was able to sort it out.\n\nBased on numerous positive reviews I opened a Wise debit card account a couple of weeks ago & transferred $30 to open the new account.\nI subsequently transferred an additional substantial amount of money from my existing Westpac bank account to my Wise account, but inadvertently used an incorrect Wise account number.
