They charge 0.35% (cheaper for high amounts) on central bank rate plus 28 cents for each bank transfer.

You can use it almost worldwide, if you do not have that currency they exchange any currency you have at the best rate. Cash withdrawal is limited but purchases up to your balance.\nI also have free direct debits for Spanish utilities set up. So much easier than Sabadell Spanish bank which did nothing but hinder me. As soon as I have everything running in Spain I will close the Sabadell account, I needed them for the counter cheque for the Notary etc. which they charged me dearly for.\nOnly thing missing is spot price if you do not have funds in that currency in your account.\nExcellent company, wish I had known about them sooner I could have made even more money.', 'review_date': '2021-04-15', 'review_time': '14:23:41', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
