They deactivated my account without providing any reasons. I asked them to give me my remaining balance of 1024.89 euros back. They told me to wait for 10 business days. After 10 business days of waiting, they advised me to wait for another 60 working days. I emailed them to reconsider as I am only a student and badly need it to pay for my school fees. I have anxiety, too. Their response was they can't expedite the process, and should treat this as their final email. Be careful on this one. This is a SCAM. I can't believe the rating of this is still 4. If only I am allowed to give any number, I would give them a negative score, which is much lower than 0.\n\nIf you need proof how they scammed me, I will be glad to provide this with you. This is a warning to everyone. DON'T USE WISE for your payment transaction if you don't wanna end up like me. I can't sleep for days because of them.\n\nWISE IS A SCAMMER!

These checks can take approximately 60 working days (you can’t count weekends or holidays), and you’ll be reached as soon as everything is done from our side.\n\nIf it has been longer than 60 working days, please reach us at https://wi.se/contactus_. Make sure to choose one of the options below “what’s your question about”, and you’ll see our numbers and contact form there.
