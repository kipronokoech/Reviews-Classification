In the last two the service has become increasingly unreliable and uncompetitive. My latest (and final) transfer has been a disaster. Issues with the Wise backend meant my biz account was confused with my personal account, my transfer was allocated to my personal account and despite Wise confirming they received my funds same-day they did not honour the guaranteed rate. After 8 calls to Wise support they cancelled the transfer and offered a refund. At that point I instigated a new transfer to value of the funds held by Wise. Rather than complete that transfer they un-cancelled the previous transfer and sent the money at the live rate from a week previous! This cost me well over £1000 in rate swing. As of date of writing Wise have still not resolved this issue. I will never use this company again and would recommend you don’t either.', 'review_date': '2022-09-16', 'review_time': '13:18:25', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

Ninety nine percent of the time the transactions were lightning fast and the exchange rate and fees are very hard to beat. You can switch currency instantly if required or they will do it for you if your short. We would highly recommend this card to travelers who don’t wish to pay high credit card rates.
