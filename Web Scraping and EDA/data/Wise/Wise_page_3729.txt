On those two occasions I actually got through on the telephone, quickly, to a person who was knowledgeable and sorted my problems out in a minute or two.\nI am an ex-pat Brit who has lived in the USA for almost thirty years now and prior to joining TransferWise and I was using the traditional banks to transfer funds from the UK to the USA. Each transaction....no matter what the amount, was literally costing me $60.00. The amount TransferWise charges is so miniscule that I do not even consider it now and I always get the published mid-market rate. These days, if I request a transaction in the morning then the funds are in my bank within a few hours on the same day.\n\nI was very dubious at first and started with small transaction after I had first joined. My scepticism soon disappeared\nTo all people that are thinking of joining TransferWise then have no concerns and create your account with confidence.
