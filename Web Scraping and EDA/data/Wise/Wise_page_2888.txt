Wise is an easy and simple international bank solution offering back accounts in different currencies and easy transfer between them. You can open local accounts even without having the typical local documents like social security number etc. I've researched intensively and there is no other bank that even comes close. The only concern I sometimes have is that my money may not be as protected as in a local bank but I also believe that federal protection scheme are limited and will never cover all you money.", 'review_date': '2021-08-23', 'review_time': '09:05:03', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

I don\'t know why, but in the last 2 months, my card has been rejected quite a few times, leaving me unable to pay for things.\n\nContacting Wise support, they just tell me they can\'t do anything, I should "contact the merchant". When I contact the merchant, they tell me to contact the "bank". Either way, when I\'ve given up on Wise and used my wife\'s card to pay, there\'s been no issues, so the issue is either with Wise alone or it is with the connection from the merchant to Wise.\n\nIt\'s really unfortunate, as I used to have such good experiences with Wise. I\'m in the process of getting an N26 card now to use as a back-up in case the Wise card doesn\'t work again, and if it works well, then I\'ll probably start using the N26 as my primary card.', 'review_date': '2021-08-23', 'review_time': '06:58:19', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nAug 31, 2021\nSorry to hear you're able to make the most of your card, Wei.\n\nRest assured we do our best to investigate from our side, but if everything looks correct on the Wise account and the card is being accepted by different merchants, it could be an issue with a specific one, and that's why we ask you to reach out to them.\n\nWhile this is very rare, if you're unable to use the card for different places, you can also try to replace it.\n\nWise Team.", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2021-08-31', 'CompanyReplyTime': '07:39:41'}
