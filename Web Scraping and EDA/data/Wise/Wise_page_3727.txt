Earlier whenever a new transaction was made,the guaranteed rate was given for 24 hours. That was customer focus option. Now given only 1 hour or 2 hour sometimes, which is of no much use and it wont benefit the customers.\n\nAlso when setting the transaction, last time I got a message saying that if you cancel the transaction next time your fees will increase. That's ridiculous.\n\nExchange rates are better when compared to others, but to compensate that high fees are changed. So no much diffference between Transferwise and other companies.

The guaranteed rates we offer are customized per the source currency. If you are paying in GBP, for example, we offer a smaller window because most transfers in this currency are instant. We also ask that our customers only confirm transfers that they intend to pay, so after you have set up your transfer, it's best to pay ASAP. We don't increase your fees for cancelling a transfer, but if you create and then cancel too many transfers, you could lose access to guaranteed exchange rates.\n\n-Zach", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2020-12-08', 'CompanyReplyTime': '15:30:14'}
