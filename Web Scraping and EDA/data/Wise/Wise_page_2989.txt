We did not recive any details within our appeal, only after long chat conversation on their main chat from somebody else. There was only 1 small issue with 1 product, which we had immediately put down from web and there was no purpose from our side to violate policy intentionaly. We asked again for appeal, as we recieved 2nd notice that our account will be closed within 7 days. We have only recieved short response that they can decide on their own and did not accept our appeal - even if we were not violating any policy in that time and closed our account (sooner than in those 7 days). I belive that mature companies take care about clients, value them and have some respect. There was lack of any of these values, it was more like their own will. Our experience is that this company is unpredictable and you can not count on building a business with them in longterm. Even if they earn money from our transactions, we did not feel any value as a client. I must say i will not recommend this company again in the future. Most of the reliable companies will first ask you to comply with policy not give you just their final decision and do not talk to you.', 'review_date': '2021-07-27', 'review_time': '05:00:38', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nJul 28, 2021\nHello there,\n\nWe're sorry to hear about your account.\n\nDeactivation can happen for a few reasons, but because of the way we're regulated, we can't share with you the exact reason why.
