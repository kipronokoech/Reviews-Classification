We need to reflect this in our price today, to help us bring down the cost of moving money in the future.\n\nFurthermore, weâ€™re charging as little as possible - currently 0.66% on average, which is still a fraction of what banks typically charge.\n\nHopefully, we can lower the cost for your desired currency routes soon.\n\nWise.', 'CompanyReplyDate': '2023-04-25', 'CompanyReplyTime': '12:15:44'}

I planned to do the same during this year's holiday, when I put money for a whole holiday on Wise card, inteding to withdraw it in the destination country. Suddenly, during my flight, Wise decided to block my account and credit card and asked me to provide bank statements, pay slips, documents showing wealth and income and many other for 3 months prior. I desperately asked them to let me use at least a few hundred euros (a fraction of what was in the account) to get from the airport and spend the night in an accommodation, but they didn't let me use anything and refused even a transfer back to a standard bank account I was using to send money to Wise. I provided what I could from airport wifi, but as it turns out, it took Wise DAYS to even look at the provided documents and ask me to provide payslips without password protection (I provided the pasword, but instead had to open each file, take a screenshot and upload that). In the end, I had to contact my embassy to get me back to EU, lost thousands of euros on pre-paid holiday expenses and Wise unceremoniously unblocked everything after a few more days when I was back home.
