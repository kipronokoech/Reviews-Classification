I replied, but, it is now over 3 weeks ago, and I\'ve heard nothing back from them about it...\n\nI keep contacting support and all I get is the same copy / paste answers "checking documents usually takes 4 – 7 or more working days" and "we don\'t know how long it will be". I have no idea if they\'ve even received the documentation I\'ve sent them\n\nI have no idea why this has happened... they told me it\'s something they do on new accounts (but I\'ve been using it for 5+ years), absolutely shocking communication.\n\nMy frozen payments (which they\'ve taken money from my balance), have dates saying when they will be sent, so I told my staff that they should get the money then, but, this date passes, then just gets updated with another date, which then passes again...\n\nI don\'t know how they think "we don\'t know how long it will take" is as an acceptable response, I have bills that need paying, and staff that can\'t pay their rent now, I just had one of my support staff quit and go elsewhere as they weren’t getting paid, and a bad review left online about my business from a new employee I haven\'t paid as they think we are stringing them along by keeping changing dates that their money should arrive. And I still don\'t know how long this will take, I\'m sitting around twiddling my thumbs whilst my business suffers, and they are offering zero help to try and fix this. No "let me look into why this happened" or "let me check they have the documents you sent", "let me follow this up for you", nothing... totally shocking.\n\nI\'ve asked the support staff if there\'s any way to speak to someone that can actually do something, but nope, I get the same copy / paste answer telling me they are busy and to wait… and I can’t access my money.\n\nNever in my life have I had a normal bank act like this. With my Barclay company account I can call them and I\'ll have some support that can access my account and tell me exactly what is going on in a couple of minutes. One time the card reader stopped working and I couldn\'t log in, and they literally sent someone round to my house the same day with a new reader.\n\nI\'m leaving this review here (and everywhere I can) in the hope that someone who can actually do something will read it.', 'review_date': '2022-03-02', 'review_time': '21:00:43', 'CompanyReply': 'Reply from Wise\nUpdated Mar 29, 2022\nHello, Andrew\n\nPlease mind that any regulated financial institution has the right to carry out compliance related checks in order to confirm who is sending/receiving money and why.
