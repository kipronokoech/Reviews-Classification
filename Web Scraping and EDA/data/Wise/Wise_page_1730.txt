All of their contact methods are now down too, can't call or chat, and email replies will come in in '2 working days'.\n\nI won't be getting paid today, and my business loan and credit payments are now delayed also, because they shut down their entire system due to this 'technical error' after sending out the ransom notes and everyone panicking.\n\nI do experience long delays with them at least once every 2-3 months.
