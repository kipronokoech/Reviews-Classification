If your card hasn't made it to you yet, there are a few steps you can take to get things back on track:\n\n- Firstly, make sure the delivery address is correct. It might sound simple, but sometimes a little typo can send things off course.\n- Reach out to your local postal office to see if they're holding onto a package for you. Sometimes, they try to deliver and miss you.\n- If you're really eager to get your hands on that card, ordering a new one might be the way to go. You can find more details here: https://wi.se/mywisecardhasntarrived\n\nLike our support team mentioned, depending on where you're ordering from, you could make a new order with expedited delivery. Get the details here: https://wi.se/expeditedcard\n\nAbout that currency value drop – we don't have any control over that. We play fair by using the mid-market exchange rate, sourced from Reuters. They're the real-time market pros, and we follow their lead.\n\nFor anything concerning refunds, please reach out to us directly – our team will check the situation and help you as best they can.

Using Wise for any financial transactions has proven to be a source of immense stress and frustration, and I strongly advise against trusting this company with your funds.\n\nMy ordeal began when Wise closed all my accounts and also blocked all of my funds. This shocking action left me unable to manage my finances, including critical tasks like paying my payroll and taxes. The lack of warning or explanation for such a drastic measure is both alarming and unacceptable.\n\nWhat's worse, attempting to seek answers and resolution from Wise's customer service was a futile exercise. Their responses were evasive and unhelpful, leaving me in the dark about the reasons behind their actions. This lack of transparency is deeply concerning and suggests a complete disregard for their customers' well-being.\n\nWise's claim that they cannot disclose specific reasons due to regulatory constraints is a weak excuse. It's clear that they prioritize bureaucratic procedures over providing legitimate answers to their customers. This attitude not only undermines trust but also demonstrates their indifference to the impact of their actions on people's lives.\n\nMoreover, their suggestion of an appeal process is deceptive. The convoluted and time-consuming external avenues they propose, such as Ombudsfin and the European Commission, only exacerbate the situation. This shows their unwillingness to take accountability and resolve issues directly with their customers.\n\nIn my case, the financial strain and emotional toll caused by Wise's actions cannot be overstated. Their lack of responsiveness and compassion have made an already distressing situation infinitely worse. I urge everyone to heed this warning: stay far away from Wise if you value your peace of mind and financial security.
