My transfer has been cancelled, and my family hasnâ€™t received this money. I havenâ€™t received them either. Wise explains the fact of not transferring the money to me with some checks with respect to my refund. The team of Wise is in my view not clear about what checks they do to make a refund. They are also not clear on when I would receive my money back. I have no certainty regarding when I can expect a refund from Wise of my money that I transferred to them in February.
