I started using the company when it was called TransferWise and was initially impressed with their low fees and fast service. However, since the company has expanded they have become an absolute bureaucratic nightmare to deal with. They ask for documentation that they already have on file or reject documentation and then later approve the same documentation when it is resubmitted. While the customer service people are friendly, they are extremely ineffectual. None of the half dozen problems I have encountered over the past year were ever resolved by the customer service staff, in fact involving them made issues more complicated and frustrating. I recommended the service to four separate people prior to realising what a nightmare the company had evolved into. All of the people I recommended had negative experiences and will never use Wise as they all had bureaucratic and administrative issues that were not resolved. It is a shame because when this was a smaller company called Transferwise they were 5 star. Now it is simply not worth the effort.', 'review_date': '2021-10-26', 'review_time': '10:52:10', 'CompanyReply': 'Reply from Wise\nNov 25, 2021\nHello, Lula.\n\nWhile our goal is to complete all payments as fast as we can, we’re a regulated financial institution and as such, we need to carry extra checks on transfers from time to time.
