I did my first transfer with them last Friday and my money was on the way (I chose the slower/ less expensive option). However, not only I had an emergency and would actually need some of the money here but also the currency exchange today is a bit higher (British pound to Brazilian real). So I contacted TransferWise asking to cancel my order. Now, CONSIDER IT IS COVID TIMES! My waiting time on the phone was just under 4 minutes, once the customer advisor (Quintain) picked up the phone, my order was cancelled no questions asked and my money was back to my account in less than 5 minutes. And that included all the account safety questions/ checks. I am just amazed by their efficiency.
