Yes, like many other money transfer services, it used to be good. But unfortunately, their expiration date has come.\n\n1. I have invited 5 people to the platform. I received multiple calls from them telling me that TW is holding their funds and halts their transfers with no reason. In a most recent case, a friend told me that she made a transfer from her TW account to her OWN bank account on 15th of December. She picked so called FAST TRANSFER because she was in an emergency. AFTER initiating the transfer, the app says they are holding the transfer for some security checks FOR 4 BUSINESS DAYS! Now is 29th of December and despite contacting them 3 times, the money is still in custody. At this very special time of the year where everybody needs money, TransferWise HOLDS people\'s money. She just receives some corporate responses from their support and "we are sorry" stuff instead of her money.\nSo, don\'t expect anything FAST anymore and be prepared for more surprises like this. Before initiating the transfer, they advertise super-fast transfer under 1 minute. When you initiate the transfer and the money is gone from your account, you will face this 4 business days which is in fact, WEEKS.\n\nI think I know the reason for this shameful unlawful custody of clients\' funds. Just recently, their buggy software or money transfer service sent out wrong transfers and extra money (double payouts) to lots of accounts. They are now emailing and asking people to refund those extra amounts. By holding other people\'s money who are completely unaware of this disaster, they are trying to keep the necessary liquidation inside their system and compensate their loss. This is what I can perceive based on the information I receive from my friends and other TW users online. This is miserable, horrible, and unacceptable from a financial institute.\n\n2. Using TW you cannot send money to Cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, etc. Apparently they don\'t want to accept that Crypto is the next generation of money and the very fact that it is replacing traditional banks and money transfer services like TW. Avoiding money transfer to such services is the most ridiculous feature of TW, in my opinion. It is odd, old-school, weird, and unacceptable in 2021 where Crypto eats the world. Till when they want to do this?\n\n3. The interface of their app and web is beautiful but lacks most basic features of a modern online banking. If you work with a bank like Sparkasse (Erste) for example, TW seems like a student project compared with it. Even the search doesn\'t work properly and you have to manually look for lots of transfers. No summary, extremely basic reports... Filters are just too basic. It is good for 2000 to 2005 but not for 2020 and 2021.\n\n4. They gradually increased their fees. At first everything was really cheap (and of course fast). Little by little they increased lots of fees and just recently I realized I\'m actually paying more compared with my local bank. Their only advantage is their exchange fee (for instance form USD to GBP) which seems lower compared with banks. I presume soon, they will lose this feature too like they lost the others.\n\nNow my friends and I are looking for an alternative. TransferWise is expired for us and we won\'t trust it again. I don\'t want my money to be lost in Christmas times.', 'review_date': '2020-12-29', 'review_time': '01:42:54', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
