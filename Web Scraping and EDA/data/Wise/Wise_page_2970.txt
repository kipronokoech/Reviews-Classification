Other payments worked just fine. When that happens, it's also good to double-check if the merchant really supports our card. It could be unsupported by them for some reason. It's usually an issue from our side when your card isn't working for different places/merchant.\n\nFor more details, please reach us at https://wi.se/contactus_\n\nAll the best,\nWise Team.", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2021-08-03', 'CompanyReplyTime': '11:31:48'}

They deactivated my account for some anonymous reason, which they never mentioned me. I have balance of around AU$6000 and they are not replying me with any kind of new emails.\n\nI will request all kind of users that initially they will transfer all your money on time, so that people give a good review but if your total volume goes above around US$50k then they will raise the flag and try to get the reason and deactivate your account. They never say that they can hold your fund, but in my case they have held my funds for 60 days & still havent got my refund...
