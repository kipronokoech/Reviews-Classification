You can always get in touch with your bank and ask for payments to TransferWise be permitted.\n\nWe also suggest trying some basic troubleshooting to get the payment through including trying it from a different device, trying it from the desktop website along with these steps here: https://bit.ly/2X23Mgd.\n\nLastly, you can wait 24 hours in between card attempts as this can help reset the system. If this doesn't work, we'd suggest trying a different card or payment method.\n\nThanks,\nThe TransferWise Team", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2021-01-27', 'CompanyReplyTime': '16:50:44'}
