When someone has had a bad experience, 11 days of calling everyday and not being able to resolve anything with your company type of bad experience... you start with an apology not defending your wrong business practices. In their response they say they can send money from Personal account to any business, I spent over 30 mins on the phone and their support told me that can't be done. I was so shocked that I had to argue about it. So either this person replying to this review, is not aware or the other person over the phone didn't know their own most basic policies. Also do not believe when they say you can send money from any bank account for Unwisebusiness. That's not true. You want to use Bill Payment to get the lowest rate, they only support BMO business. No other bank accounts. I have tried it many many times and talked to 3 4 people. You can, however, send it through credit card and pay hefty fees by both credit card and Unwise. Also For personal account you can send from many banks but for Unwise business account only BMO.\n\nOld Review:\n\nSo after 11 days of battle to try to make their platform work, I dropped the towel.\n\nLet me give you a crash course on how Unwise is this joke of a company....\n\n1. They have super strict policies on who you can or cannot send money to. So if you think it's like your bank or PayPal, think again. For example, they would not allow you to send money to a business if you are sending it from your personal Unwise account.\n\n2. If you want to create a business account with them to comply with point number 1, you can ONLY send money to that account from a business banking. Well its stupid but still not too bad... until you realize oh wait, they only offer 1 major bank for their business banking. And that one major bank is one of the smaller banks. So if you are in the 5% minority who happen to have a bank account with BMO, you might be able to work with them. All other major banks are only available on Personal accounts (which cannot send money to businesses)\n\n3. Phone support? Only 10am - 2pm Eastern time. 4 hours only!\n\nOverall, I strongly recommend staying clear of this joke of a company and find another payment processor like Veem, PayPal etc...", 'review_date': '2021-07-23', 'review_time': '19:15:26', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nJul 22, 2021\nHello, Soroush!\nThank you for the feedback, and hopefully we can help clarify a few of the points shared:\n\n1. We do support sending payments to businesses using a personal account, but what we're unable to support is funding your Wise business account from a personal one. So if you're looking to add money to your Wise business account, it should come from a business bank account in the same name.\n\n2. The banks and partners we work with depend on the currencies you're looking to send and hold. Even so, when paying for a transfer we can certainly accept payments from other banks as well, as our partner bank only helps handle the payment.\n\n3. We also offer the option to email us should phone lines be unavailable: https://wise.com/help/contact as well as live chats in some regions. In all cases, our support team would be happy to advise further on how best to handle the payments you're looking to send or receive.\n\n- Wise team", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2021-07-22', 'CompanyReplyTime': '12:43:17'}

Our system does not take into account anyone's nationality and any checks run on transfers are the same across all our users, regardless of country or currency.\n\nFurthermore, should our team require any additional information they will always make sure to contact you directly. In some cases the checks can take time to review before our team is able to specify what information is needed, which is why support might request general information as a proactive measure. This does not mean we're intentionally putting the onus on the customer to contact us, however.\n\nAs for refunds, the delivery time depends on how the payment was sent to us: https://bit.ly/2Wanqtp due to how it's processed between banks. For example, card payments can take a lot longer to refund than bank transfers.\n\nHopefully this helps to clarify, but should you have any questions or concerns our support team will always be happy to assist: https://wise.com/help/contact\n\n- Wise team", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2021-07-22', 'CompanyReplyTime': '12:36:16'}

They held on to the transfer because the exchange rate dropped quite a bit in the middle of the transfer. But they just give the usual automated response and denied any wrong doing.\n\nThis morning I have gone to send the same amount/transfer as I have done every Monday morning for 16 months. For the account I send too, to be blocked, for no reason whatsoever. I contacted customer service to see why and asked for a reason for this. I got told it would be looked into, so left it with them. Since I haven't done anything wrong and thought it might just be a simple mistake at their end, that could easily rectified.\n\nOh was I wrong, I received an email saying my account has now been deactivated. They couldn't give me reason, basically an automated email.\n\nThis company and the customer service is pathetic and childish, rather than just admit they made a mistake and let me carry on sending payments, they deactivated my account. What kind of customer service that, as I have said above they are an absolute joke of a company. I am so glad I don't have any money in the account or went ahead with opening an business account with them. All I can say is, do not do any real business with this company due to their childish ways...PATHETIC.\n\nIn response to your reply -\n\nAgain another automated reply, no surprise there then. This is all you ever get from customer service an automated reply. I am starting to think does anyone actually work at Wise.\n\nWhen you deactivated my account it blocks you from logging in, so you cannot contact anyone, other than by phone. Which is also another joke trying to get through to anyone.\n\nThe website states a review would take place, and documents would be required for the review. No review took place, you just blocked the account because no one could be bothered doing their job, simple.\n\nAfter looking at other reviews, it seems everyone has the same 3 problems - your stealing their money, deactivating their accounts for no reason and none existent customer service.
