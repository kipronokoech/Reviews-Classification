I was happy customer for many years before. Very disappointed now that after a change of policies nothing seems to work anymore and even after hours spent I have not found any constructive member of the staff. I just receive probably AI based messages from a noreply mail address. If I contact the service they need 2-3 days to answer without being concrete. I called the hotline in UK and waited 20 minutes on the phone. The lady was not able to help and just promised to escalate the case and somebody would come back to me...
