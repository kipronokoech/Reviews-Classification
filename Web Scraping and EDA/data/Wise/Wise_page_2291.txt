Unfortunately, a transfer which I made using a service provided by WISE failed. Instead of solving the problem, WISE simply took/froze the money that did not belong to them on my account (a significant amount) and has not released it yet. This issue was due to a failure on their end using an external service to transfer money into the account. So far, terrible customer service, very hard to get a hold off anyone.

It doesn't necessarily mean there is an issue, but we weren't holding your money, as it wasn't received.
