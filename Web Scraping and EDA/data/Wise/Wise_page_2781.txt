But yesterday I tried to make a bigger transfer and now I am waiting for my money more than 27 hours. I used SOFORT (Klarna) payment method, previously it worked instantly. Yesterday after payment completion it was noticed that I will receive the payment untill 8:00 am. Now it's 2:00 pm and I still don't have money on my account. I paid commision for instant payment and now it comes longer than a regular SEPA bank transfer. Support agents told me that they can see transaction but they didn't receive my money yet, so I need to wait and nothing can be done at the moment. They also told me that sometimes it can take up to 2 business days to receive the payment. But why do you placing on the website information that SOFORT is an instant payment method??? I did the transaction using the same bank and payment method last week and it worked instantly. I don't understand where is my money! How long should I wait???", 'review_date': '2021-09-22', 'review_time': '11:49:20', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nOct 5, 2021\nHello Corinna,\n\nPlease keep in mind, we can't process or speed up incoming payments. You should always check with your bank (in this case, SOFORT), for more information on that. However, EUR payments can take a few minutes up to 2 working days to reach us. We consider a delay, if it has been longer than 2 working days.\n\nCard payments are always instant, so your money should reach us much faster.

I initiated the wire within minutes of the transaction.\n\nAs we all know, and as mentioned in Wise’s own online help references, banks don’t actually send any wire transfers on weekends. They often release wires in batches throughout the business day up until just before the fed wire deadline of the following business day.\n\nHow was I (or anyone) expected to make an 8:59am Monday deadline when we have no control over when wired are sent out by the banks (during opening hours up until the FedWire deadline of 6:00pm Eastern Time)?\n\nSo, my guaranteed rate was voided and my transfer was assigned the mid-market rate at the time they received my funds at 10:00am Eastern Time.\n\nPreviously, (Transfer)Wise guaranteed the rate for longer, allowing enough time to receive the wire from the customer’s bank. Why do you even pretend to allow guaranteed rates on weekends, when absolutely no one could ever possibly meet the absurd 8:59am (time zone unstated by Wise) Monday deadline? Do you know any bankers anywhere who are at their desks at 8:59am?\n\nI was generous with 3 stars. But the joke was on you; the mid-market rate in my case was better after you canceled the guarantee. So I should be thanking you for being ridiculous.\n\nI’ll note that the fees are reasonable and I’ve always found Wise to send funds quickly. But I’ve found the responses from customer service to be pretty slow.
