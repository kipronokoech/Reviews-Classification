And given that this is the 5th or so such review (there will surely be others), it is obvious that Wise\'s behavior is no longer wise as the service provided becomes a widely known figure with an idiosyncratic mustache. So here\'s my case.\n\nAfter about 7 years of using their services and being impeccable customer, our US business account suddenly exceeded Wise\' Risk Tolerance (as stated in their 2nd email), despite the fact that "risk tolerance" is strictly an investment term and absolutely has nothing to do with our activities, that is, it was decided to close our account for no reason. Meanwhile, both of my attempts to get any legal documents/laws/links confirming their position remained ignored. And the essence of the response of Wise\'s robot employees in human language was as follows: in order to continue using our service, it is just enough to change my current country of residence to another and provide them with documentary evidence of this. Fortunately, at least they didn\'t ask me to change my nationality, for which a special thanks to them!\n\nSo I\'m wondering what if in my shoes there was a person belonging to the same nationality as the Wise headquarters, but temporary domiciled in my home "risk tolerance" country? Will this person also be asked to reside elsewhere (with retaining citizenship) in order to continue using their services? ...The question is rhetorical.', 'review_date': '2022-04-11', 'review_time': '21:38:03', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
