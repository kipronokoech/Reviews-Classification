Since then I have written dozens of emails and made dozens of calls to their support.\n\nFirst they asked me for proof of identity, which I submitted. Then they told me that everything is good and I can continue using the account. However upon login the banner that my account is blocked was still there. I tried sending a small amount of money to the account, which unsurprisingly was blocked.\n\nThen they told me to just ignore the banner, that it was some kind of glitch. I said, how can it be a glitch when I cannot send any money to the account.\n\nThey then proceeded to ask me for further evidence - proof of residence. I send them whatever possible evidence I could according to the list they shared with me. After awhile same story - support says everything is fine you can use your account now. But the banner is still there!\n\nI call them again, but this time they asked me for proof of funds. So I shared my service agreements with them and again got the same email that everything is good.\n\nI got first notification that my account needs to be verified sometime early November 2022 and after doing all of the above I _still_ cannot unblock my account.\n\nHonestly, I cannot even blame support because they are listening to me and checking the history of previous conversations and are generally polite. But the only thing they can do is to forward the request to their Verification team, which then comes up with ever more requirements. So I\'m stuck in an endless loop where my case is being bounced between myself, the support and the verification team without ever reaching resolution.\n\nIf you want to deal with Wise, please read my review and think twice - maybe there are better alternatives out there for you.', 'review_date': '2023-02-14', 'review_time': '10:47:53', 'CompanyReply': "Reply from Wise\nFeb 14, 2023\nHello,\n\nWe really appreciate your honest feedback, John, but also sorry to hear that your verification process has taken such a long time.
