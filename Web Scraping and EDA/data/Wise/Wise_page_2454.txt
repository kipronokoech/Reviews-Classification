Please be aware that some banks are very strict with that, and whenever payment gets declined- it should bounce back to us.\nFrom there, it's possible to either fix the details, or refund it.\n\nIf your sister made this payment and their bank account name didn't match their name on Wise account, payment might also have got rejected. That's because as per the way we're regulated, we need to make sure that the money would arrive to us from a matching account. In those cases, we'd usually ask for extra documents.\n\nHowever, to have a better idea about what exactly happened- we'd need to look into this with your sister. Could you kindly ask them to reach out to us at:https://wi.se/contactus_?\n\nWe're here to help.\n\nBest wishes,\nWise.", 'CompanyReplyDate': '2021-12-28', 'CompanyReplyTime': '17:48:40'}

Wise keep you updated on the progress via email and funds are transferred within a few hours of them receiving it.\n\nThe app allows you to set up rate alerts, which is handy if you're sending multiple transfers and are watching the rate.\n\nI don't often write reviews but I thoroughly recommend Wise.", 'review_date': '2021-12-10', 'review_time': '22:25:46', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
