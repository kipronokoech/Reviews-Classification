I escalated a dispute. The process was very long and somewhat confusing. It took weeks for it to complete, I wasn\'t allowed to upload any supporting documents at any point.

It is not safe and they do not take adequate actions when an unauthorized claim request is raised. Disrespectful attitude towards their users on every level.\n\nA friend`s account was hacked recently, even though they claim to be one of the safest payment methods. Less than a month later another friend of mine and I became victims of an online fraud so we did transfers through our PayPal accounts to the same Receiver and then we both claimed the transactions as unauthorized. Simply because this was the most relevant option on their website out of two only - "item dispute" (not applicable at all in our cases) and "unauthorized transaction". Then in the `notes` field more details can be given. What happened after:\n\n1. My friend didn`t give any details, just noted down "transaction not authorized by me" (even though it was authorized by her). The result: she got her money back.\n2. I was decent enough to give as many details as possible, pointing out at the deceiver registered with them. The result: I didn`t get my money back since they didn`t have a proof that a third party had done the transaction through my account (even though I had never claimed that it was not done by me).\n\nI assume that no investigations have been conducted. The final decisions were based on what we both stated in our claim requests. So if you happen to be in a situation that needs you to raise a claim, better do NOT write any details - "transaction not authorized by me" shall be enough. You will save time and get your money back.\n\nThe call center is not much better either. The agents speak English with a strong accent (English is not my mother tongue language as well, and I too have accent but we all know which are the worst cases worldwide) and it can get impossible to have a conversation. Plus they are lost in space and could not be of any help. When I finally asked to speak to a supervisor or a manager, I was told that they are both absent(?!) - in the middle of a working day. Then I was arrogantly explained that "they are also humans, you know, they have to eat, so they are having lunch now". Fine, I totally got in their "hungry" shoes and asked to be called back as soon as any of them is back, which I was told was impossible(?!). What was left then was to turn into the b**ch that I really don`t wanna be but unfortunately have to be, quite often.. Less than a minute later I was talking to the supervisor, who "miraculously" came back from his lunch right on time! No point talking to him either.\n\nIt is not a happy end story for me. But the least I can do is to spread the word so people will be more careful when using PayPal and keep in mind my advice. No need for anyone to go through this. Still the best thing to do is to look for payment alternatives.\n\nRegards,\n\nZdravka Dimitrova', 'review_date': '2016-02-23', 'review_time': '11:33:03', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
