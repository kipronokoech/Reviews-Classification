Absolute WORST service I have seen in a while. These people are FRAUDS and SCAMMERS. After I resolve my issue with Paypal credit, I am OFFICIALLY done with Paypal and their unbelievably fraudulent system!!! I will never trust them with my money again. Too much confusion and too many errors that just translate to TAKING YOUR MONEY. I recently made several payments to a clothes vendor company and then canceled them on the same day but thanks to Paypal the payments were repeatedly charged and I collected MULTIPLE NSF (non-sufficient funds) fees from my bank. I asked Paypal to write a letter to my bank explaining the situation and as usual, they were not only NOT straightforward, sketchy and vague about their error but these INCOMPETENT LIARS did not even explain the situation exactly as I has stated because they were "unable to" and only were allowed to use "specific wording" in their statements. As a result, since the wording of the letter appeared to place the error on me, my bank stated that they could NOT refund the fees to my bank account. If that is not dishonesty, I don\'t know what is.. While they may make payments "easy" for the time being, once you encounter an issue, that is when you see that Paypal is nothing more than a corporate setup to drain you of your money. Oh sure, it may be convenient for ordering from Grubhub, your favorite online store, or making a payment to a friend but you would be better off using something more reliable like venmo, cashapp, or your ACTUAL BANK. Unbelievable and this has TOTALLY destroyed any credibility that Paypal might have had for me.

Have been fighting this with repeated appeals since April. They have once again denied my claim stating they could find no fault with the company. I also sent them the 365 bad reviews stating exactly the same as my complaint. False advertising for sure ! I have written my negative answers on Paypals survey with no response from them. I have asked to speak to a live person who could explain the decision made again no response. Only response I get are generated e-mails denying my claim. I will pay off Paypal and will never ever use them again for any purchases. I will stop all my monthly subscription payments with them. I truly believe they get some sort of incentives from the companies they deal with....Several of the reviews from Wigsis also used Paypal for payment and were also denied refund. Please read all reviews before making a purchase and consider going through your credit card instead of paypal. I know that if I had used my Capital 1 credit card this would have been resolved.
