I later discovered it is a scam company and no matter what I did with pay pal they would not acknowledge the problem or refund the money - over 600$ !!! I sent the clothes back twice to the address they gave me and they could not be delivered and returned back to me, I expected support from PayPal but no they supported the crooks and paid them and every time I contacted them they just sent the same email back, an automated response. So now I am down over 600$ and 180 Euro which was the cost of posting the parcels back twice - I have lost over 800 Euro in total and no support from PayPal - so my advice is DO NOT EVER USE PAY PAL AS THEY WILL NOT SUPPORT YOU IF THERE IS A PROBLEM.', 'review_date': '2019-11-06', 'review_time': '09:59:57', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

I purchased an item. On surface, hena hair removal (also associated with other names including tays) seems legit....they are not!! When needing to return item and getting runaround I went to make a dispute with paypal. On paypal there is a threat to customers from hena/tays saying if you start a dispute they will not honor return policy and will make you ship item out of US instead of FL. It turned out I had to make a dispute because after they received, accepted and signed for my return they did not refund. Contacted paypay told them whole story and said I had proof they received it. They said may need that later. I finally get letter from paypal that mentions nothing about asking me for the proof I had to back up my complaint. Instead paypal, without using the word, calls me a liar. The entire letter was nothing but, I MUST return the item before they could begin any assistance on my behalf. How to return item. Why I must return item. I am the one with solid, verifiable proof hena/tays received, accepted and SIGNED for my return within the timeframe allowed. If hena has thieves for employees that’s not my problem. It is an expensive item. My only job was to get it back to them safely in time. paypal clearly believes their side, not mine. I have the report from USPS that details every step the package took from here to there and signature, date, address, etc that return went through. Receipts, emails, you name it to back me up. What do they have to back up their statements to paypal? I do not believe paypay did any investigation at all. I also feel that when a business on their site is threatening customers into not making complaints with paypal, that in itself should indicate the company is not operating legitimately. Even little ole me has found out many things about hena/tays that perhaps a higher up investigation should be conducted. I have been with paypay for eons and I think I’ve only met up with one person who stole my money without giving the product once in all those years. So it’s not like I’m making disputes on any form of a regular basis. To blatantly call me a liar has me furious and I plan to find another option than paypal. I refuse to be treated like dirt under under their shoes. A business is not truthful merely because they are a business and a customer is not a liar solely because they are a customer.
