Yet PayPal not Meta Pay seems to care at all. So I just gave away $130. These companies are just as much thieves as the thief himself. I will NEVER recommend PayPal or Meta Pay ever again. In fact, I will go out of my way to let anyone who’s thinking of using their services under the assumption tht they are protected, to stay way away from using them. Just another reason to add to my huge list of reasons that people are trash and companies care nothing about their consumers.

We again went through all of the above stuff to humor them, and it didn’t work. I asked for a supervisor, and was chuckled at and basically told me I’d just get transferred back to her department. I ask for technical support…oh, we don’t have a tech support department. Only customer service. No help AT ALL.\n\nSo, then begins the transfer shuffle. I was transferred back and forth for over 3 HOURS!!\n\nThe check cashing company I know did everything they could, but, this is a PayPal app issue.

I asked if we can do a conference call with Ingo to get this straightened out, and of course they said no.\n\nKeep in mind I cannot cash this check anywhere because in order to deposit the check, you have to right VOID across the front of the check.
