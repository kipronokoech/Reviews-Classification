In the 3rd I asked them to let me close my account and transfer the remaining balance to another account. I couldn\'t. After another agry message from me, a woman named A... e (I\'ve kept the message of course cause I think they remove it after 90 days... conveniently...) she didn\'t again explain what happened but she asked from me not to have any worries and send them all the documents necessary so they would let me transfer the money."

Recently been victim of fraud through PayPal, which PayPal should have stopped.

If it was me to 'reply 1' and if not to 'reply 2'. I replied with '2' because it was not me, have not had any dealings with booking.com for well over a year, and where the hell are we allowed to go during this global pandemic anyway? Needless to say for whatever reason PayPal allowed the transaction to go through, leaving me without that money I need to pay bills. Tried resolving in resolution centre and their outcome was I am 'not eligible for a refund as the transaction was authorised'. Countless emails to PayPal, no response. After a week and a half of trying, managed to get through to a customer service agent on the phone, after what must have been all of 2 minutes, the agent told me that she could see that the transaction is clearly fraud because the fraudster used a different address etc. Which begs the question how safe is PayPal and how has this been allowed to slip through their security?

Ok, I went to their website and provided shipping code and I pressed the button saying "tracking information is not needed". Result: Message saying "We are facing technical difficulties".

As long as there are no problems with the transactions, you’ll have the money within 21 days or less.\n\nHolding certain payments helps to prevent losses, by keeping your money secure. It also makes buyers feel safer and more likely to return and purchase again.\n\nTypically, you will have access to your pending payment after:\n\n21 calendar days maximum\n24 hours after PayPal confirmed delivery if shipped with: Postnord, UPS or FedEx.\nShould one of your payments be held again, there are a few things you can do that can help you get your money faster:\n\nShip directly using one of our supported carriers (Postnord, UPS or FedEx). You can upload shipping information to PayPal and we will automatically verify the delivery. Once we verify that the item was delivered, we’ll release the payment within 24 hours.\nWhen the buyer confirms delivery by clicking Confirm Receipt on their side, the funds will be released immediately.\nIf you are not able to provide us your tracking number and getting an error then please try again on another browser or if you are logged in on an iPad or mobile app then try on a desktop and see it works.
