He obviously wanted this overpayment returning from PayPal. Instead of the money being returned direct to him from PayPal, it was paid into my PayPal account minus PayPal\'s commission. After numerous e-mails my customers money was eventually returned to him in full, from my account, PayPal retaining the commision that they had previously charged and to which they were not entitled. In other words, I had paid the commission to PayPal for a payment that I hadn\'t received and that I wasn\'t entitled to. After much further time wasting with telephone calls and e-mails etc it was sorted out. Which brings us up to two weeks ago.\nTwo weeks ago I sold a badge to someone through e-bay. The buyer paid via PayPal but was £3.00 short. I requested this and he paid PayPal with an e-cheque. PayPal advised me of his payment and told me to withold the badge until they informed me that the cheque had cleared, and this payment was held by them pending until then. Yesterday PayPal informed me that the cheque had cleared and that the £3.00 was now in my completed account. I informed the buyer of this this morning and that his badge would be in the post this afternoon.On checking my e-mails before going out this afternoon PayPal informed me that my card, with a number that I did not recognise was expiring. As my only debit card is valid well into 2019 I telephoned PayPal and was informed that the number that they had given me referred to a card that was in my name. This had to be resolved and the number that had materialised was cancelled and my current card which runs from 2016-2019 was installed.\nDuring the conversations whilst rectifying the card error I learnt that my PayPal account was now in debit. The person buying the badge was tired of waiting for his badge and had opened a case with e-bay, and until this is closed the money is held pending. I have told the buyer of this and it is now his responsibility to either close the case so allowing me to send him his badge or to request a refund which he can have with pleasure. I am sick and tired of PayPal. They obviously have no idea what organisation is.
