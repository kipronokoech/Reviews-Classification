Basically my bank told me PayPal was full of it but that they would refund one of the fees as a courtesy. I called PayPal and they agreed to go ahead and credit my paypal account for $36 to transfer to my bank to take care of the other fee. About 3 days later I recieved another charge on my bank account resulting in another $36 fee. I called PayPal and the man told me sorry once our system has your information it will just keep billing you there is no way to stop it. I asked if he would at least send me a letter stating this as my bank would accept it as a merchant error this way and waive the fees, the customer service rep gave me attitude and said he would email me a letter.

Paypal doesn't let you change countries on your account, so when I moved abroad to the UK for two years I needed to open a second account. Now that I am back in Canada, I wished to transfer my money back to my Canadian account - good luck.\n\nFirst of all, Paypal limited my account for 'unusual activity' - apparently logging into my UK account from Canada was flagged as unusual activity. This alone took 30 minutes and three representatives to clear up. After that was sorted, when I went to transfer the money I was asked to verify my account first. To do this, the only method was to receive a text message, and the only phone number available was my UK cell number. As I am back in Canada, I no longer have access to that phone and the number no longer exists. This is where things went from frustrating to incomprehensible.\n\nAfter I was incorrectly transferred twice, I was told by a Paypal representative the best way to get my money was to 'find someone I trust' in the UK to transfer my money to, who could then proceed to send it to me. I was flabbergasted that a site that prides itself on security was recommending that the best way for me to send my money - to myself - was to find a third party in a foreign country to send it to and just cross my fingers, hoping they don't decide to screw me over and keep the money for themselves.\n\nI asked the representative to override the verification - after all, they were speaking to me on the phone and I had already verified who I was. They said this was not possible, as there was no way to override the security checks. I asked to speak to a manager. After another five minutes on hold, I spoke to a manager who told me that there was likely nothing I could do for at least 24 hours, at which point there were a couple other options I could 'try', but she wasn't sure if they would work. Really? You work for Paypal, have managed to obtain the position of manager, and you don't know the system well enough to tell me what will and won't work? She also couldn't guarantee that logging back into my UK account from Canada wouldn't flag the system and limit my account again.\n\nI don't know how, or even if, I will be able to access my own funds - from an account that was only created because of the original Paypal flaw of not allowing someone to change countries on their account. People move, Paypal - you need to be more accommodating. Furthermore, every time I was transferred or put on hold, the next person I spoke to needed to re-verify all of my information, resulting in an incredibly tedious process of reading out my name, email, account information and security checks each time I spoke to someone new. The fact that two phone calls speaking to seven different representatives was unable to resolve a query so simple as transferring funds from one of my Paypal accounts to the other has left me frustrated and cost me the better part of my morning.\n\nI have never written a negative online review before, but the service I received this morning incensed me into doing so, so others can think twice before trusting their funds with this bloated and unreliable system. I will be closing my account immediately after this is resolved, and recommend others either try using a competitor or rely on an old-fashioned money order instead.
