I searched tirelessly but they all started at $500 than one day while on Instagram a ad appeared with silicone mask. These mask were perfect from a picture standpoint. My son was excited and so was I. The ad led me to Instagram page and that page led me to a website. The site said one day sale almost 85% off original price. After I placed my order I go an email receipt. I knew instantly something was wrong. The receipt was for "old man silicone mask" the mask I ordered was of a young man in his 20\'s with a nicely trimmed beard. I attempted to contact the seller which was almost impossible. The seller never responded so I contacted PayPal. PayPal contacted the seller and the seller contacted me with a tracking number. But what I needed was the item in the picture on the website to be as described. The next day the Instagram account disappeared, the website disappeared as well. PayPal said that the company had a certain amount of time to respond and if they didn\'t I would receive a full refund. Well PayPal denied my claim and I was pretty much robbed by an overseas company based in China and PayPal allowed it. These companies are so advanced at robbing people. PayPal didn\'t do this but they allow it. Just imagine how much money these overseas China based companies are making. And PayPal is helpless. DO NOT PURCHASE OVERSEAS ITEMS THROUGH PAYPAL AT NO POINT. BECAUSE PAYPAL IS NO MATCH FOR THESE CYBER CRIMINALS IN CHINA.', 'review_date': '2020-11-26', 'review_time': '18:54:14', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
