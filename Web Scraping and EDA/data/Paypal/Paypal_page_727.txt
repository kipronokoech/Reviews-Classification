{'platform': 'Paypal', 'id': '5d4635ecf018690bd0486ec4', 'stars': 1, 'title': 'The Ugly Truth About Paypal and eBay', 'message': 'If you are contemplating selling on eBay I’m going to do you a huge favor and tell you DO NOT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, EVEN BEGIN SELLING ON EBAY. Don’t presume because you have been on eBay since 19-dickety-two that it is the same eBay - it is not. You will waste an unbelievable amount of time on the phone with both eBay and Paypal. Note they are NOT the same company any longer. Further, note that Paypal’s contract with eBay ends in 2020 and like all short timers, Paypal is, in my opinion, maliciously doing everything in its power to illegally hang on to both Buyers’ and Sellers’ money for as long as possible. eBay is powerless to do anything as evidenced by many calls I’ve made to Paypal with eBay on the line.\n\nYou will waste an unbelievable amount of time on the phone with both eBay and Paypal. You WILL run into a plethora of problems with both eBay and Paypal, many of which can only be resolved on the phone with their representatives in the Philippines. I am Asian American and many of my clients are from the Philippines. Often they are treated unfairly by immigration officials because they sound like they understand English far better than they do. You can imagine what dealing with Filipinos on the phone is like - obviously they are hired because their English is quite good. Unfortunately, neither eBay nor Paypal has done anything about the fact that their comprehension is nowhere near their ability to speak. You will read many comments about eBay’s robotic and non-responsive telephone reps. It is the disparity between their enunciation and comprehension that causes them to repeat the same thing over and over. It is the reason why you often can not fully resolve an issue without escalating to a supervisor. Clearly, the supervisors are supervisors, in part, because they understand English as well as they enunciate English. It is not uncommon to be on the phone with eBay for one, two, three or even FOUR HOURS to resolve the most mundane issues. It is also not uncommon to be on the phone with them daily or every other day. Laughably, eBay will often ask you to have your customer call either them or Paypal’s Customer Service. In the rare instance that your customers do call into Paypal, Paypal will give them erroneous or confidential information about YOU, their customer, to YOUR customer.\n\nThose are the highlights. Now, onto the five major issues that make eBay sellers want to gouge their own eyeballs out. 1) The amount of technological prowess a seller must have in order to utilize the eBay platform is quite substantial. I am very tech savvy and worked for Microsoft. In my opinion, eBay sellers should complete an online course BEFORE they begin selling on eBay so they understand what equipment they will need, the level of tech savvy that is expected of them and so they are properly informed that live assistance is the only manner in which any issues can be resolved or questions answered.\n\n2) The technological platform of eBay is incredibly robust and intricate. It is the way eBay micromanages its Sellers. Too bad for you if your post office loses a package or doesn’t scan all packages in at the time of drop off. You, the Seller, will be automatically dinged. The only way to resolve this? Phone support. Unfortunately, the human support side of the eBay equation is mind numbingly insufficient to support the issues that arise from using such a complex tech platform.\n\n3) Because eBay is moving to their own managed payment processing once the Paypal contract ends in 2020, Paypal doesn’t care about supporting eBay Sellers (seriously). The misdeeds of Paypal will result in Paypal holding your money for inordinate periods of time, bad reviews because Paypal messed up and your customer didn’t get a refund until 10 or 15 days AFTER you issued the refund, or Paypal suspending your account for ostensible “fraud protection” measures. It is clear to me that Paypal is simply maximizing their cash reserves at the cost of eBay Sellers and Buyers. Their fraud protection measures are actually fraud-conducive. Take it from me. I am a former financial fraud investigator.\n\n4) Paypal is CLOSED ALL WEEKEND. I mean, this is just laughable. Along the same lines, Paypal has a policy of never manually overriding withheld funds until at least 49 hours AFTER you have called them and that presumes they can even verify the package was delivered to your customer. Although eBay swears tracking info is uploaded automatically to Paypal, this is untrue. There is no rhyme or reason as to which labels you generate on eBay upload automatically to Paypal and which do not. In order to get your money, Paypal demands you verbally give them the tracking information in order to release your funds. Now, how is that a fraud protection measure? That is CONDUCIVE to fraud. Additionally, even if you manually upload the tracking information to Paypal, you can’t select the carrier. PAYPAL SELECTS ONE FOR YOU - USUALLY ONE YOU HAVE NEVER USED. So, oops! Paypal holds your funds because you entered a tracking number for USPS and Paypal defaulted it to UPS.\n\n5) Let me explain how a short timer like Paypal operates. Once I called at the end of my rope given the runaround I had been given by Paypal and the fact they would not release funds that even eBay said they had no right or reason to withhold. The person on the phone held up his earpiece for all the people around him to listen to me justifiably frustrated and angry... and they all had a hearty laugh at my expense. Now, that’s some real professionalism, eh?\n\nThe Feds need to investigate Paypal STAT. They are illegally withholding funds, delaying payouts, suspending accounts, and breaching confidentiality laws. Their withholding of funds is no different than check kiting except their crimes are on a global scale and literally encompass funds in the billions. Just the interest alone on illegally withheld funds must certainly be massive.\n\nIn order to sell on eBay, you have no choice but to use Paypal. eBay knows Paypal is illegally withholding funds and causing non-stop problems for both buyers and sellers. Nonetheless, eBay refuses to allow Sellers or Buyers to use anything but Paypal unless you have been invited to be a beta participant of their Managed Pay System.\n\nI suppose it’s great for eBay if Paypal sucks so badly that Sellers jump at the opportunity to use eBay’s Managed Pay System when it rolls out. As to THAT, read what the eBay Community says. It is the opinion of longtime, well established eBay Sellers that the Managed Pay System replacing Paypal is simply a way for eBay to gouge Sellers by increasing fees substantially in a not so obvious manner.\n\nCorporate greed - you gotta love it. It’s consistent as hell.', 'review_date': '2019-08-04', 'review_time': '01:34:05', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
