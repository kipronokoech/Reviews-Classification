On March 5, 2021, paypal gives me a notification saying Scribd charged me $9.99 for the subscription....the subscription I ended back in 2019. Immediately I contact Scribd the exact same day by email since they don't have a customer support line number. In the email I attached proof of the transaction from PayPal, my account details and proof that I have not renewed the subscription service since 2019.... no response by March 10, 2021. So I contact Paypal to dispute the charge and they immediately shut me out of my account a few minutes after I submit the dispute. They come back the next day saying the case was closed and they could not prove the transaction was unauthorized because the subscription to Scribd was still open. My issue with this is that they did not give me the chance to submit my physical proof (the same proof I emailed Scribd support) and instead quickly closed my case. So I go contact their employees via the chat system where I can submit the photo proof and the employee just tells me that they still believe the transaction was not unauthorized. Instead the employee tells me that the best she can do is give me a voucher for $9.99 to try and make up for my loss. I accepted since it was the best they could do but I was still upset since the voucher (money that has to be spent by September or I lose it in my paypal account) is not the same as having my money back that was stolen from me. I had to dispute the charge with my bank who actually understood the situation and credited my account back with the $9.99. If I hadn't chosen years ago to get a bank account and had stuck with Paypal I'd be out of money right now so for anyone reading, use paypal cautiously when shopping online. Always pay with your credit/debit card and not your Paypal balance.", 'review_date': '2021-03-10', 'review_time': '23:11:54', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

The buyer used the item for 5 and half months and then contacted Paypal, claiming it was defective for a full refund. Paypal then actioned it and said he can return it for a refund. Upon receiving and inspecting it, I found no defect what so ever and so sent Paypal both pics, plus he posted the item in a carrier bag with tape round it, not in the original box either. Yet Paypal have completely accepted the buyers version with no proof and then to add insult, fined me £12 on top which they say is a dispute charge. Where is my protection as a seller by Paypal? I'm still chasing Paypal to give me a clear reason to their decision making. Clearly there so called protection is completely meaningless and useless.
