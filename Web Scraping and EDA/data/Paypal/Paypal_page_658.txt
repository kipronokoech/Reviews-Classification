When I saw the "PAYPAL\' logo, I made a bad assumption that PayPal wouldn\'t put their service on bad businesses. Instead of tools I was sent a pair of cheap sunglasses. My mistake was thinking PayPal is as good as a credit card from a "Bank". It is NOT. My brothers bank already had the company listed as a scam and replaced his money immediately.\n\nI on the other hand went back and forth with PayPal. After over a month, they requested I return the cheap sunglasses to "China". They claim to provide return shipping information, however, they never supplied a "Zip Code" with the fictitious address. You need a zip code to even get an estimate, let alone actually shipping. Which I was told by the UPS store, would have cost me almost $200.00 to send back the Cheap Sunglasses. My refund was for 209.85. So it was useless to send back. PayPal denied my claim. They sided with the scammers. I closed my account with them. Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me!!

I have been trying for over a week to transfer money out of my PayPal account. I initially tried to transfer 4x over a week ago due to the instructions of the PayPal rep. He said the issues were with my bank. Next day I spoke with my bank they had no issues. Nothing was ever presented by PayPal for a transfer. Called PayPal back they said it was Ebay. Called Ebay they said funds had been released. Spoke with PayPal again they said a hold was put on my account and I'd have to wait 72 hours. I waited the 3 days called PayPal back and did 1 transfer with a rep on the line. 12 hours later it was denied again. Spoke with bank they said nothing was sent to my card. Called PayPal back got another excuse that I tried to transfer too much and to try again with lower amount. So the next day called PayPal again and did 1 transfer at lower amount. Guess what denied again. The rep tells me to just download the app and go to Walmart. I installed and uninstalled the app over 5x because the Walmart code would never generate. I spoke with 2 more reps who suggested to just keep trying because nothing is wrong. I asked every one of the 11 reps I spoke with to give me a supervisor no one had one available. I was left on hold several times for over 19min each of which I have screenshots. Today spoke with a rep who did get a supervisor who basically said &quot; I'm sorry for your troubles but there's nothing I can do&quot;. I have uploaded my driver's license several times, I have waited for over a week. I'm beginning to think this is by design. I really really need my money for things I've sold on Ebay and this has been the worst most stressful experience.
