Customer service for over 15 years and this is the worst experience I've ever had. Tried to open a business account for my community HOA - 5 min later, received an email that PayPal cannot do business with me and said it was due to risk but gave no way to dispute it. Not a great start. Called customer service and the agent could barely understand me. I had to repeat my email address multiple times and then get told, there is no account associated with the email address. What?! I'm logged in and starting straight at the PayPal account that has that email address. I ask for a Supervisor but their busy and that they'll call me me. We all know the odds of that happening. I say I'm getting really unhappy and need to speak to someone now, another supervisor in their call center or the supervisor's manager. No one is available. I politely tell the agent that PayPal this is the worst customer service I've ever experienced and the fact that I cannot even resolve this without hoping someone will call me back is unforgivable. They lost my business - both personal and for our HOA. The worst decision they made was going entirely off shore in their CS to shave off money and having individuals that can barely understand what I'm saying. Companies may say they care about quality but they don't - they care about that bottom line and this is the experience you get.", 'review_date': '2022-11-08', 'review_time': '22:29:48', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

This is an organized crime institution made to rob you on a first occasion. Beware, and do not give access to your accounts and private data.\nMy account has been limited for the fact that I receive money from my brother. In order to resolve the limitation I was asked to provide personal information and documents. Instead of getting any reply my account with the deposit was silently blocked for 180 days, which I found just by chance. After contacting the customer service for clarifications, my account was permanently blocked without anyone contacting me or providing any reasoning. This is really ridiculous!!!
