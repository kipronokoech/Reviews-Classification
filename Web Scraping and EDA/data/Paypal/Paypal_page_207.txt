A few days ago, I've realized the money is missing from my account, withdrawal made by Pay Pal account. When I've contacted them, they've explained to me that I have authorized a payment for some gaming subscription for a year and set up the Direct Debit to GDC Media ltd. To explain my case, I am 57 years old and never played no games in my life time and wouldn't know how to if my Life depends on it and I live alone - so nobody else could do on my behalf. Pay Pal ''faked'' their compassion but still told me that it was authorized and I can't get my money back. I've tried to close my Pay Pal account and they wouldn't let me even though the case is closed. So of course, notified my bank, stopped any further withdrawal, past the case to fraud department and ordered new bank card! All this because I've had an account with Pay Pal and decided to pass my bank details to anyone to withdraw money, set up direct debit and make subscription without my knowledge. They are thieves and I suggest everyone close their account with them if they wanna protect their money", 'review_date': '2022-04-30', 'review_time': '03:20:51', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
