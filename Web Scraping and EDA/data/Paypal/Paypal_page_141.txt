So it was OK to let a "dangerous" company to go straight for a private checking account to endanger it\'s contents. These occasions have become too numerous lately, so you never know if you are using PayPal for a large purchase and get to pay off your balance over 6 months period or they just grab the last $2000 that you have in your checking account without even notifying you that they are doing that.\nAnd lately they came up with a new legend that my bank refused a transaction, so they paid for me, and when a refund was in order, they just kept the money, although originally they charge my checking account for the amount they claimed my bank refused the transaction.\nThe customer service guys keep changing their explanations, it is difficult to get through on the phone, which makes me personally want to just close my account and be done with them.
