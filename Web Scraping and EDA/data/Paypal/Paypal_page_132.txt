I do not believe that Paypal should police or be the arbiters of what people can/cannot say. Furthermore, I am not confident PayPal could implement a system that'd be 100% accurate/fair in regards to enforcing this potential system.\nPaypal claimed this was added in error; however, weeks later it was still added to Paypal's Terms of service.
