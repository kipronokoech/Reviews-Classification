I’ve never needed to use their message centre previously. I was experiencing poor customer service so decided to request my account was closed. I used the message centre to make this request. I was advised my account balance had to be zero to close the account. I transferred the £2.45 out of my account as recommended and requested the account was closed. I logged on to the PayPal app 3 days later and could see my account and bank details were still accessible. I then contacted my bank (TSB) and asked all future payments to PayPal be stopped. I was advised these payments had been taken by the long card number previously and no regular payments were set up by paypal. On the 2.8.2019 Paypal deducted £40.38 from my account. Since that date I have been contacting both PayPal and TSB regarding this matter. PayPal have failed to respond to 7 messages via their message centre since contacting them on the 5.8.2019. When contacting their customer service I spoke with a very rude an unhelpful advisor who point blankly told me she would not put me through to the complaints department or a manager. When I asked her for her name she then hung up on me. I then called back the following day to raise a formal complaint (10.8.2019). I had also logged a complaint previously via the message centre and once again got no response. PayPal......I requested under the GDPR that my personal data was removed from you systems on the 20.7.2019 and again on the 24.7.2019. You failed to do so. Instead paypal took funds from my bank account (Despite notifying TSB I request all future payments to PayPal to be stopped) via a direct debit (regular payment) that was NOT in place when I contacted my bank on the 23.7.2019. I can only presume the long card number was declined so you chose to deduct unauthorised funds to be taken via a direct debit. To date I have received no communication or update regarding this matter......your customer service is shocking', 'review_date': '2019-08-16', 'review_time': '12:01:37', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

BOY WHAT A MISTAKE! I always make sure that the funds are available and in all year\'s of using PayPal I\'ve never had any issues with any of my payments being declined or not having enough funds to cover my payments but with that being said PAYPAL DECIDED TO HOLD MY RENT PAYMENT FROM MY LANDLORD FOR 7-10 DAYS ON 2 SEPARATE OCCASIONS FOR NO GOOD REASON OR WITHOUT EXPLANATION!!! This most recent time the money was deducted from my bank account on the 12th and here I am on the 16th writing this review because they STILL have my rent payment on pending!!! Customer service was absolutely useless even after speaking with a so-called supervisor named Jason who told me "the reason was because i had never sent such a LG amount through them before which caused an automatic hold" when I told him to please look back through my history to see that I had in fact been making my rent payments through them for almost a year making his statement was wrong, his only response was that I was right and he couldn\'t understand why they had placed this hold on my rent payment in the 1st place. He proceeded to tell me that he would see what he can do to make sure that this wouldn\'t happen with "future payments". But in fact he had no real power to actually remove the pending status that day and that we would have to wait out the pending time. I had to call my landlord and explain this to him which was absolutely an embarrassing call I also sent him a screenshot of my checking account showing him that PayPal had ALREADY TAKEN THE MONEY OUT OF MY ACCT! (LEGAL ROBBERY)!!!\nHOWEVER with great recomendations I have now switched over to CASH APP & VENMO which are much more reliable applications to send and receive funds. I can\'t recommend these other 2 applications more, in fact after my landlord saw the screenshot of the rent payment clearing my acct a whole 4 days ago he has decided to also drop PayPal and start using VENMO for future rent payments & even shredded his Paypal credit card!
