However, it seems NOW that they have BECOME THE SCAM SELLERS friend-NOT YOURS. In the PAST, I could dispute purchases where the seller was a SCAM or sent the wrong/cheap item (usually from CHINA). It is VERY HARD to figure out which Internet sellers are from China since many now have UNITED STATES ADDRESSES. However it is very easy to know once you receive something that you did not order (like a cheap $1 oven mitt after I ordered expensive Bat guano fertilizer for my fruit trees). Most recently I have had 2 SCAM Companies ( Kalesafe.com and a Florida company that advertises all sorts of household items, but is based in CHINA and does not send what you order- Again USA ADDRESS, but based in China.\nIn BOTH Of these recent cases, Paypal was NO HELP and actually sent me BACK TO SCAM SELLERS (even after the scam sellers refused to help me via email). Luckily, I have a good credit card company who let me dispute purchases and credited my account as they "investigated" BOTH disputes of wrong/cheap Items.\nDO NOT USE OR TRUST PAYPAL. They are no longer there to HELP YOU. They only want the MONEY SCAMMED BY BOGUS SELLERS (mostly from CHINA).

They have cost me endless amount of time, anger, stress and financial loses in various transactions. Without my permission they have sent a charge to my $0 balance bank account. I have a late rent payment out there floating around with extra late fees now because they did not allow a usual and often long time performed transfer of funds this month saying what I was requesting was a security risk which I fought unsuccessfully. I was to my son with the same last name even. They ended up doing the pymt as a check after a few denials but never told me they were doing a check, never gave me the option to cancel and deny and if they did I could have gotten the cash and paid it right away! They won\'t remove a very old mastercard from my acct. They won\'t link & allow me to use a new mastercard which I\'ve set as my preferred pymt method. They ignore it an choose on their own without notification a different way to charge my purchases. I\'m losing 1% cashback due to their errors & I can\'t get it fixed with them. Their wallet and my wallet are two different things; they should be the same. I say my issues are A-B-C: they ignore those issues and give me answers D-E-F! They are awful! Use other payment sources!
