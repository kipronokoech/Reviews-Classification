In their claim, they haven\'t uploaded any evidence except one message that said "YouTube channel not received, I want my money back". I provided over 30 pictures of evidence that were numerically labeled so that they could be easily reviewed, and I wrote a ton of text for each labeled picture explaining how the channel transfer unfolded, as well as multiple messages in which the buyer confirmed that everything was received and that they were very satisfied. I received an email in less than 6 hours in which they informed me that they had decided in favor of the buyer. The buyer basically won the claim by typing a single simple message and providing no evidence. This is completely absurd! In no world an actual human being reviewed this case.
