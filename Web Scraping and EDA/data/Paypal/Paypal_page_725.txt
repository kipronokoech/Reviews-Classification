Their policy is to refund as its better to keep the customer happy for life. It wasn’t a huge amount but the lack of service from PayPal is just unbelievable. Never again will I use them.

I ordered a smartwatch from China but they sent me an absolute pile of rubbish that was nothing like advertised, apart from the fact that it was a watch. Cutting a very long story short I can only get a full refund if I PAY FOR INSURED AND TRACKED POSTAGE to the other side of the world in order to return the junk to the seller. So, I've got to pay a fortune to return something I did not ask for in the first place; I've got to trust an obviously dishonest company in China to say that its been received in good condition before I get a full refund, but the cost of postage is down to me. I've argued with PayPal about this but they don't give a damn and they're appear to be only interested in closing complaints rather than looking after us buyers.
