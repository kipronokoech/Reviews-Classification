I ordered an item off Facebook and a piece of tat of no worth was delivered in its place from China. After several emails to the crook and vendor I had to go into PayPal resolution where my case has been stuck in limbo for months and months and months... you get the picture. Well tonight sitting around doing diddley squat I decided to see what was happening and lo and behold PayPal have closed my case and award the funds to the fraudster. They claim I didn’t send information despite having sent several photographs and PDF’s and this is displayed on their resolution site. The problem is that I am not the only person that this has happened to and I now suspect that PayPal are covering up fraudulent activities. There is enough of these cases which would merit a class action to be taken against them by several people like myself. Just how many other people has this happened to?.', 'review_date': '2020-10-17', 'review_time': '18:37:56', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
