Kept getting emails that verification was rejected as the details did not match. Spent in excess of 10 hours making phone call, being on hold and getting poor customer service, each one telling me different information and saying account is under review. When I finally do get my money out, I will be closing my paypal account and will not be using again. In the years I have used them, they used to use an Irish customer call center which were very helpful and understood what they were saying. Now you have people different counties, and although they are fully appolgetic and polite, they can be difficult to understand and don'e seem to have record of MANY previous phone calls I have made to them.
