This rating should take into account customer experiences and it’s abundantly clear from the reviews that PayPal is sorely lacking in ethics, customer service and accountability.\nMy son has been trying to recover $1000 of his funds owed by PayPal for almost a year and only got the refund in the past week or so, almost a year after PayPal manufactured all sorts of excuses primarily that it was my son’s fault with absolutely no admission of culpability on their part and a point blank refusal to refund the money until my son eventually went to the HongKong financial services watchdog service and filed a complaint.\nClearly at this point, they were more concerned about their reputation than about honesty, customer service and refunding what they owed.\nMy son had been using PayPal with an associated CitiBank account for some time without error but on this occasion, the payment was not transmitted. My son contacted his bank who provided documentary evidence that the payment had been processed.\nDespite multiple attempts and the provision of substantial documentary evidence to PayPal to support the fact that the money had been withdrawn by PayPal from my son’s account, they continued to deny and declined to reimburse until my son filed official complaints.\nEven after getting a response, they STILL deny any culpability and, along with the refund which should have been paid with interest considering they had use of his money for nearly a year, they wrote him a letter letting him know that they were doing him a favor – what audacity!\nThis has cost my son money, significant time and undue stress. I am appalled by their behavior and have closed my account and encourage others to do so. There are many other available services for transmitting money which I plan to take advantage of. PayPal is one of many and, in my opinion, at the bottom of the pile.\nShame on you PayPal for taking advantage of the very demographic who are the reason you exist.', 'review_date': '2019-12-17', 'review_time': '19:12:39', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
