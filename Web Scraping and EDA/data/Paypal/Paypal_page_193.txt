Currently, I am on hold for going on 120 minutes with no end in sight regarding a serious financial breach. Impossible to get live person to speak with you and if you do, they don't care or explain anything. Messaging is even worse. They never understand what you are saying. Not possible to resolve a thing with them even though they have your money. Bad situation.\nGo elsewhere for your financial transactions. Much better solutions available now.

I was a seller, accepting PayPal payments for many years. I never had one single problem or dispute. As my account was by default personal, I thought, that it might look more professional to change into business one. I spoke to PayPal business account adviser and I was completely assured, that if I convert my personal account into business account, my founds will not be put on hold as it usually happens with new accounts and I will be free to accept and receive payments as I used to. Assured by their representative, soon after I converted my account which was in outstanding performance into business account. Payment from my very next sale was placed on hold for mandatory 21 days, unless I do ALL those things : have an account in good standing for 60 days, accept over 200 pounds in sales, complete at least 10 transactions via Paypal and confirm my phone number. I spoke to the their representative and I WAS TOLD THAT "APPARENTLY THINGS HAD TO CHANGE SINCE I LAST SPOKE TO THEM" !!!!! Then I was assured, that my funds will be released once I mark my items as posted. I did. Guess what... They are still on hold 2 weeks later. I removed PayPal payment option from all my accounts and now I will only accept stripe !', 'review_date': '2022-06-16', 'review_time': '22:44:04', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

They were out of stock and had to cancel my order, no biggie. They took the liberty of transferring my refund through Paypal, which was where the problem truly began.\n\nI forget why I even made a PayPal. I think it was for a purchase off of Discogs that never ended up getting to me. I signed up for PayPal so someone could pretty much steal money from me, but that\'s not my issue today.\n\nI had to fight through the most annoying automated receptionist I\'ve ever clashed heads with. The machine asked me for everything I didn\'t have, which was literally the reason I called. I ended up getting frustrated at the machine for wasting my time, and eventually yelled for a customer service rep. After about ten seconds of silence, I was put on hold.\n\nI haven\'t used my PayPal since I started it. The debit card I used as well as the phone number I used are all out of service. I tried to request a new password, but the only option for resetting your password is to get a phone call with a code. Since I used an old phone number, I can\'t physically get my code.\n\nI decided to call customer service. That didn\'t help me at all. The guy asked for the last few digits of the card I had used. I told him that card was cancelled so long ago that I don\'t even remember which card it was. I asked if he could send the confirmation code to my email, and he said the best he could do was to send me the code to my PayPal account itself.\n\nHe tried sugar coating it, telling me that "nobody can touch that money but you". I made it clear that since there is physically no way for me to get into my PayPal account, that money is completely lost and I won\'t even be able to touch it.\n\nI guess there was a very good reason I didn\'t use PayPal.\n\nAlso, make sure if your customer service agent is going to belch on the phone that the customer can\'t hear it.
