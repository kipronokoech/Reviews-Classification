Even with full verification, a linked bank account, proven identity in multiple ways, 2 phone numbers and a verified email, they refuse to release the funds for 30 days! Customer service is useless and apparently can't release the funds if they wanted to. If Paypal had gotten my permission to use this kind of security procedure or pay me interest on this short term loan they're receiving, i might be ok with it. What kind of business could possibly trust PayPal when they sequester your funds without any possibility of release even when you verify your identity? Does PayPal benefit financially from all these funds they are holding for 'security' purposes? Who is this security procedure really helping?
