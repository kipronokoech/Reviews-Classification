Once the funds were available on PayPal, I decided to use the Get Cash option because I didn't want to have to let them take the $10 (1%) processing fee. I need the cash right away. I get to the Walmart Cash Center to receive my funds, only to be told that the transaction was declined for reasons unknown to the cashier. So I get on the phone with PayPal and they tell me the cash withdrawal service is down, but that they can e-mail me when the service is back up. I got tired of waiting, so I decided to just eat the 1% transfer fee to my debit card in order to receive it within 30 minutes. Now I get a message saying that there is an unknown problem with the transaction, but that they will continue to push the transfer through and would waive the 1% fee. However, now this transfer could take up to 24 hours. Here I am 27 hours later, and the money STILL hasn't shown up in my bank! I just got off the phone with customer service again, and after some investigating, they said they're going to have to trace this transaction to see why it hasn't gone through yet, but that it should be available for sure within the next 24 hours. I am livid, so now I'm waiting an entire extra day. If it's still not there within 24 hours, I am going to file a complaint and demand that my money be put through immediately somehow before I hang up the phone. This is the worst service, I've never had an issue with them until now. So after this, I certainly do not plan to use their service ever again.", 'review_date': '2018-11-17', 'review_time': '00:04:56', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
