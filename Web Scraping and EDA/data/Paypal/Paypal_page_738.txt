I did not use the service very much, but in the last year I did quite a lot.\nHowever my experience with them in the last month was so bad, that I cancelled my account with them.

Over the next four week I've had to make over a half a dozen calls to them to try get a refund. Further to that I've had to get a refund for the items post and package as well.\nI found it strange that they asked me to add a bank account for this, when I have my debit card added to my account with them and it was used to purchase my item at first.\nI cant say exactly how much money I spent on calls to them or the time I lost out of my personal life while waiting to try get through to them, and then when you finally get through, due to the answering machine service they have which does not recognize your voice when you try putting in the mobile number which is on your account. You then have to explain your issue over and over even after been verified.\nIn general I would advise anyone considering using paypal to think twice, it's not worth the waste of time or hassle and your best just use your debit card and if you dont trust the company you want to purchase something off, then just dont buy anything.\nPayPal have the worst service and the length of time to resolve an issue after buying something is crazy if you have an issue.", 'review_date': '2019-06-26', 'review_time': '11:27:16', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
