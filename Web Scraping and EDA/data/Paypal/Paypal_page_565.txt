I was a victim of fraud through them at which the amount of £39.99 was stolen from my bank account. The company in question was plastered all over the Internet with people making the same statement as me, in that they have had money taken from PayPal by them and My bank also deemed this a fraudulent in refunding the money back to me. Paypal refused to see any such pattern or take any such responsibility and still deemed this to have been a billing agreement I had set up with this fraudulent company (Well know for their scams). With little to no means of appealing their decision or submitting a complaint to them. The only option being to submit an email complaint through their website, requiring yet more of my personal information (Phone number) in order to proceed. Since I have been bombarded with scam phone calls each morning. I went round in circles with this company an in receiving generic predrafted robotic responses (some of which didn't even relate to my complaint or query). I recieved no response to any of my complaint points or and answer as to what investigation they had actually done. Moments after my complaint I recieved an email from them claiming I would no longer need a password to access my account with them (which is a joke because I gave them no such permission to do so). Once you create and account it is also impossible to delete it (although there is and option to close your account, the website will send you around in circles and it will never be done).", 'review_date': '2020-07-02', 'review_time': '14:37:05', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
