Every single week on a Friday when I receive my money PayPal puts a hold on it. It’s usually under £100 that comes through, and without fail they put a hold on it. I’ve made complaints, I’ve called and asked why this happens to me each week, and not one person can give me an answer. They are that under-confident in their own system they actually recommended my employer change payment provider to stop this happening.

I thought maybe I had been distracted even though I was pretty sure the credit card was the right selection. I managed to cancel the payment but then the second time the same thing happened despite clicking the credit card option and despite my credit card being selected as preferred mode of payment. Paypal put the blame on my bank who was adamant if they had turned down the payment they would not have suggested another card, besides I was far from having reached my overdraft. The site I purchase from accept credit card payment so beside Paypal there is no logic explanation. I want to file a formal complaint but after writing the object of my complaint I click on enter to see a screen telling me It was not working! I wasted my morning talking to people unable to provide me with a satisfactory explanation or able to offer a satisfactory solution. This was a pure waste of time. I am seriously considering closing my account since I cannot afford to have bank charges for their own mistake and absence of competence.', 'review_date': '2021-07-17', 'review_time': '10:21:01', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
