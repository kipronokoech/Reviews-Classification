I used it all the time with eBay, and having become accustomed to it, I also used it out of preference to using a credit card to buy on other websites too. Two things have happened recently that have completely destroyed any support I will give to this company:\n1) They have decided to charge a full fee on cancelled eBay transactions, instead of just the nominal fixed fee that they used to charge. This means that sellers who are forced to give refunds through the eBay Buyer Protection Policy (whether there is actually anything wrong with the sold item or not) will not only have to give a full refund and pay for postage in both directions, they will now lose the entire fee that they had to pay to Paypal for transacting the payment for the original sale - even though the sale is cancelled. There is no way on Earth that this is justified.\n2) They have introduced a new two-step verification process for signing in which requires the use of additional technology, such as a mobile phone. I cannot get a reliable mobile phone signal where I live so I cannot use this system without great inconvenience (I have to go to a location where I CAN receive a signal so I can receive the code, then take it back to my computer to type it in).\nThey also offer to call a landline number with a security code, but they never make the call - it always fails. So I am now locked out of my own Paypal account.\n\nIf you try to send them a message to complain about this ludicrous system not working, you have to log in to your account to be able to do it - which is the ultimate Catch 22!\n\nPaypal have lost the plot, and now they have lost me as a user. I will now only use Paypal if I have no other options available to me, instead of using it as my preferred way of paying for things which I used to do. How any company can foul up their customer relations so monumentally as this as a result of their own deliberate actions is totally beyond comprehension.', 'review_date': '2020-12-30', 'review_time': '17:11:09', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

Letters, emails, calls over and over for THREE months to get someone who would take my money. I paid it in full, to find that I was misquoted by PayPal, and still owed 77 cents. I then paid $1.00 as the employee could not figure out how to process less than $1.00. Now I have overpaid my loan. Of course, they will keep the extra amount. NOW I am getting notices that I owe 54 cents and my monthly payment is $126.70 a month (on 54 cents!). I called and found that they have no idea why I owe 54 cents and no idea why I owe monthly fees. They cannot seem to figure out how to change the system to reflect that they owe ME money by my overpayment, and I owe them nothing. I have wasted countless hours trying to resolve this. NOBODY knows what they are doing, when it comes to the pay-back-the-loan issues. Talked with five persons so far, and they are all clueless.

The concept is great, but it is a terrible service if you need help resolving any sort of issue. I accidentally sent a large sum of money to a person in Europe with the same name as my landlord in the United States. PayPal told me the only way to get the money back was to request from her. Thankfully, she was very generous and responded after 7 days of white-knuckle anxiety. I did not speak her language and needed a friend to translate our e-mails. Ridiculous PayPal allows you to send that much money to someone a continent away without any way to resolve. Later, my bank disputed the transaction in error and this person was debited the amount of the dispute. PayPal claims there is no way they can prevent this until the bank drops the claim, even though she returned the money using their service and both of us attest to this!
