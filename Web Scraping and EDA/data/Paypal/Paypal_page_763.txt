Until now.\n\nFirst, I fell pray to online ticket scammers who only accepted payment through "Family and Friends" which I found out the hard way is not buyer protected, nor will PayPal take any action despite knowing their platform is being used fraudulently.\n\nSecond, I sold some stuff on Gumtree for $360 + $36 postage and when the buyer sent me the money it sat there on hold (I couldn\'t access it), because there\'s a new bot that detects "unusual transaction amounts" and apparently this was a "large amount" so I was advised I would not be able to receive the funds until the buyer had received their items. Literally.\n\nNever in the history of buying and selling would someone be expected to pay to post $300+ worth of goods to a stranger without payment. I\'ve never heard something so ridiculous. Despite me not meeting ANY of the 3 criteria for a payment to be held (no issues with eBay either, I checked), they have just randomly stopped me from receiving a payment for no reason at all. Now they\'re telling me I could have had to have waited 21 days for the funds to clear. Hang on, aren\'t they just there to enable money transfers???\n\nIf I had instead used bank deposit, I would have been able to contest the payments to the ticket scammers, I would have received the payment for the goods within 1-2 days (and everyone still would have been buyer protected), I wouldn\'t have spent 2 hours in online chats getting frustrated because there was no explanation provided, the buyer wouldn\'t have waited an extra week and this review wouldn\'t exist.', 'review_date': '2019-02-18', 'review_time': '22:25:14', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

I filled out the appropriate information (there was no shipping as the tickets were transferred via my season ticket account). Stayed in contact with the buyer throughout the process and thought all was well. Weeks after the event, the buyer disputed the charges with his "financial institution", claiming he didnt make the transaction. Instantly my paypal account had the transaction amount deducted from my balance "until the dispute was settled." I provided all information requested (an explanation, any documents, etc etc" clearly showing I did nothing wrong and that this dispute should be invalid, at least towards me. Seeing how it is out of my control and knowledge if I did in fact make a sale to someone using someone else account. I called several times and was given various stories and explanations. I was even told multiple times I did nothing wrong and the money would be credited back to my account once the case was closed. This morning I received notification that the case had been closed in the buyers favor and that I am responsible for the charges. I called customer service, again, and even after the numerous times I was told I was protected and that I did nothing wrong, today they tell me they cant do anything because the buyer went through his financial institution. I was told they would attempt to reopen the case and that I\'d be receiving an email shortly after my call. 5 hours later, no email. All in all, their "investigation" on disputes is a joke. I provided clear evidence that I did nothing wrong and that clearly the buyer is trying to get out of paying for something he received, yet they do not care.

They assured me that my cards would be removed from there and reactivated for use with PayPal so that I could open a new account or use guest check outs in future with no issues. Bought something on eBay and go to pay, guess what happens? PayPal block the payments despite the cards now being on a different account and PayPal confirming that they will work. I try removing the cards and doing a guest check out, still doesn’t work. This makes me look terrible to the eBay seller and could cause a non-payment claim/strike against me due to PayPal’s lack of ability to do their jobs.
