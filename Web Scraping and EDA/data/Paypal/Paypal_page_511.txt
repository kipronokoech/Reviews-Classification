But if you want to send a substantial amount, and you need to transfer money thinking it will be as fast as when they pay from your bank account, you are wrong. It is almost instant for them to take from your bank to pay someone, but if you transfer your money mysteriously disappears for up to five days. That can amount to a lot of interest that paypal makes holding your money. That is a hidden cost of doing business with paypal. And it can be very inconvenient.', 'review_date': '2020-09-10', 'review_time': '01:01:31', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

I know $38 is not a lot of money, and certainly won’t break my bank account, but it’s the principal. The fact Pay Pal is willing to go with this fraudulent company, and not with a longtime existing customer is disheartening. Shame on you Pay Pal!!!\n\nI guess lesson learned.

I made a purchase in early July for a bird bath that was almost $100 less than the ones selling at reputable merchants. While I had some apprehensions about buying from the site, I was greedy for the lower price (if it’s too good to be true, it generally isn’t!) but felt reassured as there was an option to buy with Pay Pal. Once I hit submit and didn’t receive an order confirmation from the Seller but received a text from PayPal shortly thereafter that a payment had been made to someone in China (the Contact on the website was in the US), I realized that something untoward was going on. I called the contact number in the Us and got voicemail. I immediately called PayPal and Informed them that I thought that this transaction was fishy. They immediately filed a fraud report and told me to give the buyer two weeks to ship the item. After A month and twenty phone calls (and god knows how many wait times) and no communications or item from the seller, the seller sends fraudulent USPS tracking info stating that the item has been delivered. When I call USPS, they tell me the item had been delivered to my zip code but not to my address. Then PayPal says they will refund the money three different times before telling me that they can’t refund the money as it shows that it has been delivered. I ask them to call USPS themselves but they tell me they don’t have the capacity.\n\nI then turn over the case to Amex (which is the CC) that I used. It’s still in dispute.
