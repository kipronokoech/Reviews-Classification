They decide to restrict customers accounts for so called “security measures” at the worst times possible. I’ve been using them for over 20 years. Now don’t allow me access to my account because I am stranded in Vietnam due to the covid situations and I don’t have an active mobile number in the US to “verify that it is me,” they don’t accept my Skype number for verification, which is the prime contact number on the account, and they won’t accept any other verification methods! Unfortunately, I’ve been using PayPal to pay my bills and I have many auto payments with them. Now, I cannot manage and authorize payments. What’s more upsetting is that I’ve called their customer service line almost every day in the past two weeks and I am getting no solution. I’ve explained my current situations every time I spoke with a representative or a manager, and I’ve repeatedly asked how do they expect me to receive the verification code on the number listed on file, while they don’t accept the number for code verification—it just doesn’t make any sense! Since they don’t accept my Skype number and I currently don’t have an active mobile phone in the US, why don’t they use other verification methods—is it a crime that I travelled to SE Asia and got stranded there?! There are numerous other methods to verify the identify the account holder than their verification code on a mobile phone. The usual answer I get from them is: “Sorry I cannot do that because the computer won’t let me!” I ask to speak with the department that determine those policies and program the system, and the common answer is: “ Sorry, sir! This is the highest manager, you can speak with and there is nothing we can do!” They persist that unless I receive the verification code on the phone number I have on file, which is a number that their “system” doesn’t deliver through it, I won’t be able to get verified and won’t be able to access my account while I am thousands of miles away from home and relying on PayPal to manage my finances!
