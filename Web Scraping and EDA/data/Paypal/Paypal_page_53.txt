Very hard to contact support.

Later the business support team was cancelled. This is the same situation a colleague of mine had and they move well over $3M a year with Paypal.\n\nAs a consumer they have been closing cases ahead of the schedule when a company has not delivered what they promised. The Paypal site times out the login before chat support responds (useless support feature) and phone support is really difficult to contact with long waits.\n\nAccess to Paypal Marketplace is some sort of club you need to know someone to get into to. Sales department for that product never contacted me back after many months of trying to reach someone.\n\nPaypal used to be great, but now it is not and the fees are also not the cheapest in the market anymore either.

At the end of last year, several fraudulent charges appeared on my Paypal World Mastercard; I was able to have them reversed and a new card issued, but they reappeared for months on end online (though not on my monthly statements) -- several long calls to customer service failed to resolve the problem. This month, I noticed that although I had elected to autopay my credit card balance using my Paypal balance, Paypal had debited my bank account for the full amount instead. I called Paypal customer service and after a considerable hold, spoke to an agent, who immediately transferred my call to Synchrony Bank (which handles Paypal's World Mastercard); after a difficult exchange with its automated system (it's like pulling wisdom teeth to get through to an agent) and another long wait on hold, I spoke to an agent, who did her utmost to fend me off and transfer me back to Paypal. Upon being informed that Paypal had transferred my call to Synchrony to resolve, she finally contacted Paypal customer service herself. After another interminable wait and about an hour on the phone, she came back on to tell me (circuitously) that because the statement balance on my Paypal Mastercard exceeded my Paypal balance, the entire amount had been taken from my bank account, i.e. Paypal has an undisclosed and counterintuitive autopay policy that disregards my autopay choices and necessitates making manual payments in order to use my Paypal balance to pay down my Paypal Mastercard statement balance. I think that any reasonable person would expect the opposite from what Paypal says on its website (i.e. that I had elected to pay my statement balance using my Paypal balance first and use my bank account as a backup payment source). Paypal offers me .5% more back on purchases than my other credit cards, but it has cost me many hours of time in dealing with its lack of security, defective website, and undisclosed, inappropriate policies.
