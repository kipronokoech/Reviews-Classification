I have been trying to get a refund through Paypal for a return item that was never processed through a certain retailer. It has been 3 months, and paypal have repeatedly closed the dispute claim and reopened it under another dispute issue to extend the time frame. I cannot speak to anybody on the phone apparently, which forces me to continually have message them, which results in talking to a differant person each time and having to repeatedly explain the situation as Paypal obviously have no concept of continuity and dont read case notes or even previous messages which is absolutely maddening. I have all the proof to show that I am entitled to a refund, yet for the last couple of weeks, Paypal have ignored my request to send these documents and have not provided a link through my dispute to do so. It is becoming increasingly apparent that Paypal and the retailer in question are colluding and putting every barrier in place in order to not issue me a refund. Considering legal action as a result. Avoid business with them at all costs', 'review_date': '2020-08-13', 'review_time': '08:48:34', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

To sign up for this, you must provide payment details which I did through PayPal.\n\nOn the 11th July, having done 3 classes in the space of 2 weeks (as a reminder, it was supposed to be a 4 week free trial), I received a call from a man named Chad Perenzee, a “student guidance manager”. He was no more than a salesman, triggering a cascade of payments to my account. In the call, I explained that I was there for the 4 week free trial and just to get a better understanding of the course. I also gave feedback about the course, thinking that it was a legitimate educational company. At the end of the call (5 mins), he explained that he would unlock the premium account for me. He was speaking fast with a South African accent so I told him to send me an email about it all so I could understand what he was saying then. Right after the call, I saw a notification pop up from PayPal on my phone of 199.96GDP!!\n\nI searched up how to contact Shaw Academy. They have no contact number. There is one that was attached to their PayPal account but of course, it doesn’t work! The only email address they have is support @ shawacademy . com to contact them. I emailed them several times to explain my case and request for a refund. Each time, there was only an automatic email saying they have the email and will get back to you in 48 hours. Afterwards, no reply! I tried emailing them from another email account about different questions, how to join, what courses they offer, and they reply straight away!\n\nI then begun trying to contact PayPal themselves to dispute the payment. This cannot be done! When you sign up for the free trial and they take your PayPal details, any point after that, they can charge you without your permission. PayPal assumes your consent on anytime onwards and does not get involved with this.\n\nYou may think the issue lies in the Sham Academy but actually, it's PayPal!! People think their money is safe through PayPal , not knowing that PayPal allows products to be paid for there onwards without your consent.", 'review_date': '2020-08-12', 'review_time': '15:22:28', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

We started with a personal account and when we established a non-profit organization we opted to start a new business account for it. There has never been a dispute, refund or any other negative activity on the account. However, PayPal has started to place funds on hold. When reaching out to customer service to resolve this we have been given misinformation by no fewer than 4 of their customer service agents. Some have blatantly lied and only backtracked on the lie when pressed to provide proof of the policies they were referring to. On more than one occasion we have provided the requested information only to be met with rejections and requests for information that has absolutely no reference to our organization. For example, they keep asking for vendor information when we do not sell or provide any physical products. At this point my thoughts are that PayPal has decided that they will use customer funds to provide themselves with short term interest free loans. In contrast, our organization uses other payment processors and have had absolutely NO issues whatsoever.', 'review_date': '2020-08-12', 'review_time': '02:26:27', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
