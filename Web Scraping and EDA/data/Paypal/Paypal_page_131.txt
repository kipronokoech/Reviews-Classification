{'platform': 'Paypal', 'id': '63890838b84cc27618fd9b27', 'stars': 1, 'title': 'They are not safe ( scam )', 'message': "All the reviews that state the negativity surrounding PayPal are completely true rather than some people having bad experiences with PayPal. I completely agree with all the people who state the shittiness of paypal. I created my 1st PayPal account about 2 or 3 years ago. When i recieved my 1st PayPal income from a buyer who has bought an item i listed on ebay, i never got the money ( not because of PayPal's $hitty money freezing system ) but because as it turns out the buyer of the item i listed was an account that was hijacked and not the actual buyer themselves. So the ebay account that made the purchase was a hacked account. I waited to get the money for a few days atleast or same day, soon after the purchase i think i got notifications from PayPal that the money was on hold. I also got notifications from ebay that the buyer requested a refund or the money i recieved was being refunded back to the buyer because their account was used by another person. So i then waited for the money to be sent back to the buyer in my PayPal account, but as it turns out that money was forever on hold on PayPal and the buyer was never refunded. The amount was at least 4 or 5 pounds. I was left confused as to why the money was frozen and the person never got their money back ( this will be a follow up later in this review ). I have rarely used PayPal ever since because i just wasn't bothered. But at least months later, i wanted to go on PayPal again so i went to the login screen and put in my password which was automatically saved and my email address linked with the account, but something was incorrect. I thought that i might've changed the password and forgot about it, as it turns out that never happened. So i go to the reset password page and it asks for my email. I put in the email i had with the account, but it kept saying oops something went wrong. I've tried resetting my email after that happened, but it never let me reset the email. I kept trying to log into my PayPal account by trying to reset my password and email, but they kept sucking my dick wrongly. I have kept trying to log in, i tried to contact their support but UH OH! you have to log in to use the f*cklng support. So then i was absolutely f*cklng angry with PayPal and i have been looking up how to reset PayPal account, or log in if you have forgotten the information. I tried again, but it kept giving me an oopsie daisy something went wrong. So not long after i have been looking up reviews of PayPal and most of them were people that have been f*cklng shot in the ass by PayPal. People who have lost money over PayPal, people who never recieved their money, account problems, $hitty customer support, never getting money, money never sending, etc. So now that person who has been hacked on ebay and never got their money back from PayPal has been f*cked by PayPal same with me and most other users of it. So i have witnessed infront of my eyes a hacked ebay account give me money by PayPal, the owner of the account gets it back and gets an automatic refund of the amount that the hacker charged them with, but PayPal kept that persons money frozen and never gave it back. I have also seen reviews of people being charged money to recieve money by paypal. And business accounts taking too long to recieve money, and not all money recieved. Even though i have not witnessed most problems people have had with PayPal, i'm far from convinced that those reviews are legit. PayPal in a nutshell is what happens when a corrupt party of North Korea makes a money app for its people. I strongly suggest you don't use PayPal for any purposes. If you do to give money or recieve money, you will be f*cked either way. Giving money through PayPal has a high chance of the cash you sent being frozen by PayPal and PayPal will only get richer and richer every time they freeze money. They will get closer to becoming more worldwide and an empire if you use paypal for money purposes.", 'review_date': '2022-12-01', 'review_time': '22:02:00', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

They\'ve taken two payments from my bank for concert tickets - I only intended for one payment to be taken but their site timed out whilst I was paying and I was told to start again! So I did. Now somehow I\'ve been charged twice, the money is actually gone from my bank account, BUT I have not received my goods (which should have been immediate as they are concert tickets!) It\'s saying "AUTHORISATION" on my PayPal account with no real explanation, so I have no idea what is going on, especially as I\'ve been charged already, but it looks right now like I\'ve been charged a LOT for NOTHING? I\'ve been in touch with where I bought the tickets but so far they have no answer... so I\'m beyond angry and once this is sorted I\'m thinking I might stop using PayPal completely going forward as I don\'t trust them now.\nUPDATE: After speaking with PayPal they blamed my bank. Called bank who said the issue was definitely PayPal and that they do this all the time! The bank had authorised the payments (which is exactly how I can see it on my account) but PayPal were holding the transaction or something. Anyway, I did not get my tickets and have now missed out completely thanks to PayPal. My friend said she has the exact same experience with them last week when buying a gift online.
