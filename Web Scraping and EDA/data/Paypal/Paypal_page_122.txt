If you are a seller, stay away from PayPal. PayPal\'s policy actually encourages scammers to scam honest sellers.\n\nIf you sell something online, the scammers(buyers) can always file a dispute saying the item received is significantly different from description. For example, they can claimed to receive a brick while the seller actually shipped them a smart phone. Even with all kinds of proof, PayPal won\'t care. PayPal will ask the buyer to ship the "item" back to the seller and issue a refund to the buyer. Of course, the buyer will ship back a brick.\n\nIf you sell something offline (transaction in person). The scammers can also claim they didn\'t receive the item. Even if you have photos or videos of the scammer, there is no way you can prove the person in the video is actually the one who filed a dispute.\n\nSo in short - if you are a seller, don\'t use PayPal. period.', 'review_date': '2022-12-28', 'review_time': '02:43:01', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
