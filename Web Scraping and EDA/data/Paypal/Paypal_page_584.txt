{'platform': 'Paypal', 'id': '5edd6bde25e5d20a88aa36f8', 'stars': 1, 'title': 'Paypal ambivalent to questionable sellers', 'message': 'PayPal is a service that claims to be easier and safer than using a credit card, ATM card or online check. In my brief experience with PayPal it may be easier but it sure isn\'t safer. Based on my experience I\'d suggest that if a product is selected at any online site and they only option for payment is PayPal delete the item and any personal information, exit the site and find it elsewhere, use a site that offers multiple payment methods and choose anything but PayPal. Why you might ask? PayPal\'s loyalties are squarely with seller\'s and not with Buyer\'s. PayPal doesn\'t care if you never receive an item, PayPal doesn\'t care if the item you purchased is not as advertised, PayPal doesn\'t care if buyer websites are real, but mostly PayPal doesn\'t care if the seller site pretends to be in the United Sates when it really is in a foreign country primarily China. PayPal doesn\'t care if the seller sends a false shipping tracking number or any other number of shady business practices. Sure PayPal has a method for disputing a purchase but when a dispute is made their mantra is to "contact the seller" basically saying "we are not going to help you\'re on your own". So if by some miracle a valid email address can be located good luck getting any type of response, the seller already has your money and are on to the next person to scam. When a credit card from reputable banking institution is used and something goes south they are more likely to wave the charge and pursue reimbursement from the seller. After having several unpleasant situations when using PayPal I decided to delete my account and vow to never use this service again.', 'review_date': '2020-06-07', 'review_time': '22:36:14', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

I have paid over 600 dollars, over a month ago now for an order which was NEVER SENT, I have email confirmation a month later from the seller that he will not be shipping my item, yet PayPal still won't issue me with a refund. The sellers backed out of the order after taking two payments and then failing to send products for 3 full days, because he did not want to send internationally. We were not happy as one can imagine, so he tells us he won't be sending it out, or sending the refund. So obviously we opened a case!! The seller told me this grand story about how I needed to send it to friends because he didn’t want to incur a fee, he originally stated that he wanted to use V**mo but I live in Ireland so V**mo is not a payment platform out here. From the get go he was unreasonable and demanding about how to send money and then in the end HE NEVER MAILED THE PRODUCT, I HAVE NO PRODUCT AND NO REFUND!! Again what part do you simple minded nincompoops at PAYPAL not understand!! HE REFUSES TO SEND MY REFUND, WON’T ANSWER MY CALLS, WON’T ANSWER MY EMAILS, HAS STOLEN MY MONEY AND PAYPAL HAS ALLOWED HIM TO DO THIS THROUGH YOUR OWN CRIMINALLY RAN ORGANIZATION!!! So since he won’t refund it, and I don’t live in the states, the Jacksonville police said its PayPal’s problem, PayPal says it’s Tyson Pham’s problem, Tyson Pham says he won’t refund my money, so where does that leave me, Rachel Byrne??! Hmmm where does that leave the f**king customer huh?! Over €500 euros stolen from her, 5 kids and currently pregnant, and €500 euros ripped from the mouths of her children?! I won’t stop emailing PayPal, leaving reviews until your company stands by the customer and FIXES THIS!! MAKES IT RIGHT! DOES THE RIGHT THING FOR ONCE AND REFUNDS MY MONEY AND HOLDS TYSON PHAM ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE SCAM HE IS RUNNING THROUGH YOUR SITE!!!!!!!!!!!!! These disgusting stain on society of people in which PayPal employs, closed my case and refuse to answer my messages. I have explained myself thoroughly to PayPal since and they have given have given me the absolute run around, avoiding answering simple questions, avoiding the fact that NO order has been sent out or would be by this seller, even though we have messages from him stating as much, he refuses to send our products and he claims he will not. This is totally unacceptable, I have 5 children, not able to work right now on government orders and this is so bad, it's scandalous. I have fully informed PayPal of my situation, even about having 5 children and now instead of answering my repeated questions and the fact that goods were paid, nothing was sent out and now even they keep ignoring my messages. This PayPal company is the devil.... zero respect or empathy for people. I will be very happy when enough people give up on this disgraceful company and it goes bust because nobody will ever use it again based upon how they treat their customers.", 'review_date': '2020-06-07', 'review_time': '11:55:53', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
