It only returns automatically to Paypal and Paypal automatically keeps sending it back to the bank in that loop continuously every day. I can\'t even transfer it anywhere else or make a purchase with that money. Now I\'ve also been complaining to customer support for a YEAR now, but every time I have to explain this to a chatbot or a different staff and it is a headache. After countless emails back and forth and months, they keep saying "Please wait for a few days, it will reflect in your account" every time by a different person, and the transfer never happens. Talking to my bank they never receive any money sent from Paypal. Now for my peace of mind, I deactivated and closed my PayPal account with all that money in the loop and I am happier to let go of those hard-earned dollars that keep going back and forth from PayPal to my bank account and back to PayPal in a loop then use this stupid unsupportive service where I have just have headache and wasted a lot of time and money. I recommend that we never use such unprofessional Payment gateways anymore and stand up and ban such fraud companies! Especially for professional business scenarios where we have worked our asses to make every bit of those dollars! Instead, now I just use professional banking services, they may charge you a bit more but our work will get done and you\'ll live in peace without paypal!', 'review_date': '2023-05-28', 'review_time': '18:42:11', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

TrustPilot will remove bad reviews on behalf of paypal like they do mine - genuine reviews explaining how awful Paypal has been and how much damage they've done to our business over the years.\nIf I ran a business the way paypal does I'd be bankrupt with no customers in no time at all - how they exist in 2023 is beyond me, given that there are MUCH better payment platforms out there. PayPal's downfall is its inability to function as a payment platform, it exists to take money paid to you, take huge fees and give AWFUL conversion rates, then, for it to make you BEG for your money by placing ridiculous limitations on your account and then providing NO HUMAN HELP - just complete automation which I've heard drives some to the bring of insanity - holding money in excess of 180 days, bringing some small businesses to its knees. We've had ENDLESS account limitations - I am happy to share ALL EVIDENCE of what we've gone through and if the review is removed we'll take legal action against TrustPilot for removing a genuine, non offensive review. I am the owner of SEO AUDITS IO - we sell digital products, we've had CONSTANT problems with PayPal placing limitations on our account, wanting us to send months of bank statements, submit proof on lots of transactions even though people buy a digital product and receive a download from the website, somehow we're supposed to provide this proof over and over again - yet we use stripe and never have any of these issues? funny that. Stay WELL AWAY from Paypal if you value your sanity - I've been shoehorned into using Paypal for many years but now there are lots of other platforms out there it's time for unhappy people to vote with their feet. We've removed paypal as a payment option - good luck to them, they're going to need it.
