For example - I cancelled an automatic payment to a merchant who had billed me three times for the same item. Then I went three times through resolution - not asking for them to return the fund but to explain how it happened so I could avoid it in the future. They kept saying the same thing - their reason for paying the merchant was that I cancelled my automatic payments after the merchant billed me. I had sent them documents (internal PayPal documents they had in my account with them - but I sent them copies anyway) for each round. The documents indicated I cancelled automatic payments to the merchant Oct 6 and the last billing from the merchant (third time they charged me - and the merchant kept pushing off delivery (sept, oct...) - all documents I sent into Paypal again in resolution for each round) was Oct 13. They refused to clarify the discrepancy between their statement to me about resolution (that I cancelled before the billing) and what I had from them in writing previous (Oct 6 I cancelled automatic payments, Oct 13 they paid the merchant). I have to keep the PP account open for someone to pay me through the system twice year - but I have cleared out all my cards and anytime I have the choice it will be anything other than Paypal. I would encourage all consumers to be very wary of Paypal. And sellers who use ONLY Paypal I now know why and I now hold suspicion as Paypal favors merchants over any company I have dealt with. You will not find your agreements are held as consumer. You will not find consumer protection from merchants who want to trap you in a deal of endless waiting.', 'review_date': '2021-10-27', 'review_time': '16:39:43', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
