In addition, the tops that did come were not of the quality depicted in the photos. According to the company my order was "Complete". Bear in mind this is after waiting a month for my order to come. I attempted , more than once, to get this taken care of through the seller with no luck. I then accelerated this to a Pay Pay dispute claim on May 22. They told me to have no further contact with the seller. I asked about returning the items I had gotten. The response I got was that any contact with the seller would end the claim process and they would give me the results of their investigation within a couple of weeks. Now, here it is, July 14, 2020 - 8 WEEKS LATER. There has been absolutely no action taken. The only result I have is the date for resolution keeps getting put back on an almost daily basis. I get NO FEEDBACK on what, if anything is being done, AND it is now TOO LATE to return my items.
