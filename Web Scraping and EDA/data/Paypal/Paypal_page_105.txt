It tried to take from this account twice, emailing me that it was my fault I didn't have enough funds in that account. That one is savings only, where I keep the interest from my checking account, and I never use it for transactions. Because of PayPal's mistake, my bank charged me overdraft fees. When I used the chat feature to demand help, PayPal did not understand the problem and still tried to blame me. Then when they understood, they never took responsibility, never offered an apology, and never tried to increase my satisfaction at all. I will not use them again.

Wow, they acted like a weird and creepy pal first of all.\n\nI booked an airbnb, used PayPal as the payment method and chose to pay in full - therefore coming straight out of my bank account, I had the funds and wanted to pay there and then - I got my confirmation from airbnb that all was done.\n\nDay after, I see no money has come out of my account (I keep an eye on my finances, especially in these days of frugal and careful budgeting and balancing)\n\nI went to my PayPal account and contacted them. Was told \'it will come out soon dude, don\'t worry, got yo covered man\' attitude. I don\'t want that, a creepy arm round my shoulder telling me don\'t worry when it\'s MY choice to pay.\n\nThat was the 29th of Jan. I was told it will come out in a couple of days!! Issue was, they had THREE different methods on file as options to take this money AND told me they were taking it off a bank card number that didn\'t exist!\n\nThey\'ve not only strung this out, I have been in touch when it did NOT come out, I\'ve paid into my PayPal account when it failed (I keep an eye out, as I say, and NO reason it failed, I\'ve had to keep that balance for the airbnb on my account, despite usually having the power to have no more than £50 in it, just in case of fraud) so I kept a full £204.65 in it. Due to them stating on the app the THREE different methods, I also had to keep the same amounts on another card, and my credit card as well as in my bank! I couldn\'t spend money for all this time.\n\nEventuality, they gave me a NEGATIVE BALANCE on my PayPal account on 3rd Feb!!! I then paid into my PayPal account so it was NOT negative, and was cleared!!! I contacted them again and was told again "duuuuuuude is all OK man, nothing bad gonna happeeennn!" - my balance was in credit, the airbnb paid in full, several communications to say "dooooooooodis all fine, relaxxxxxxx"\n\nToday..... today I get a text from my bank!!\n\n£378.82 taken!!! Bank fees to be paid, online shopping cancelled. I call PayPal, they say yes you owe us nothing and yes you\'ve done nothing wrong but "dooood, like your money will totally be back in your PayPal account in 5-7 working days so relaxxxxxx"\n\nNOT ONLY did they delay, when they then went into my account they TOOK the payment again, plus a balance that WOULD have existed if they\'d NOT been able to take that money (I had £30 in my PayPal as well as 3 x the money in the 3 method for full payment - £204.65 x 3 + £30 credit in PayPal) I cannot understand why they think this is 1. OK to start up, 2. Then mess up and 3. Not resolve!!\n\nWorst processing I\'ve ever seen!!!\n\nEff you PayPal, you\'re no pal, you\'re a messed up company that cannot process anything, nor actually let humans resolve issues nor be suitable for HUMANS to be involved with EVER AGAIN.\n\nOVER TWENTY YEARS as a customer.\n\nOur relationship is over and we\'re not going to stay friends, I betcha you understand "Dooooooood"', 'review_date': '2023-02-08', 'review_time': '12:46:07', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
