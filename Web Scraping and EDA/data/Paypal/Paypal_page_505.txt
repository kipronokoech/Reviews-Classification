By 8th September 2020, I have sold over $30,000 dollars and all the transactions went through PayPal.\nOn the 9th of September PayPal sent me an email stating that my account had been limited and asked for some information e.g. tracking information for the items sold, which I provided ensuring all the items were delivered.\nAfter this I received another email saying that my account is permanently closed and PayPal no longer wants to do business with me. Email example: “For the safety and security of the PayPal network, we often review accounts for potential risks. After reviewing your account, we have decided to close it because of high risk to paypal”.\nAfter this I called PayPal and asked for a reason for the closure of my account and what do they classify as high risk.\nI was told that a reason would not be provided and PayPal reserves the right to close any account for any reason and hold any money in the account for up to 180 days. I have a lot of money in my account that PayPal is going to sit on for the next 180 days.\nAfter the first call, I have called again for more than 4 times now and spoke to various people even the limitation manager, but none of them were able to provide me with a reason on why PayPal are closing my account.\nThis is totally unfair, probably illegal in many ways, and ultimately a bad decision for PayPal. This is not a way to deal with any customer, this is horrible customer service. No one should ever trust PayPal with their money and I am never keeping any money in PayPal EVER AGAIN.
