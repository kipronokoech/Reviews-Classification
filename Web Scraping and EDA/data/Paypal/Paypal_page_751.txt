A friend that lived out of town wanted to send me money for a trip I paid for, and when I tried to transfer the money from Paypal to my checking account using the Free option, the money transfer would not work, but using the Instant Transfer option that charged a 1% Fee, amazingly that option worked and the money was Instantly Transferred to the same checking account as the Free option was attempting to access. THIS IS A TOTAL SCAM, and Paypal should be worried about a Class Action Lawsuit for all of the customers it is screwing for the 1% Instant Transfer Fee, by not allowing the Free Transfer. This is why Zelle and Venmo are more secure and user friendly. I highly recommend never to use Paypal for money transfer!!1', 'review_date': '2019-05-02', 'review_time': '14:00:20', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

I can assure you that all of these are very true because they have all happened to me. I got paid for work that my crew and I did for a lady and I made the mistake of trusting pay pal and told her she could send me the money through there. After reviving the money I had told my employees that I would transfer the money over that day. I proceed to do so and I come to a screen that tells me I can’t take my money out, so I contacted “customer support” and stated that I needed to file a complaint about my money and they did’nt send me an e-mail back for another 3 days and when they did it was a automated e-mail saying they would be happy to help and to email them my problem which is what I did in the first place. I send another email with even more detail and it’s been 6 days and still no response. They have since shut down my pay pal WITH all of my money in it that my employees rely on. In the end they froze MY money and put a message in my pay pal saying I’m not going to receive my money for another 180 DAYS!! I’ve since lost money out of pocket paying for my employees, lost loads of trust in pay pal, and now recommending no one uses these crooks.
