I called the customer service at PayPal and talk with someone who informed me that according to the transaction number in the email they sent me, someone had my credit card information and used my PayPal account as a guest so it doesnâ€™t show up as a transaction on my account at all to send money to another account. I started a dispute against the transaction and PayPal completely dismissed it as an authorized transaction. I tried 4 times to dispute it to no avail.
