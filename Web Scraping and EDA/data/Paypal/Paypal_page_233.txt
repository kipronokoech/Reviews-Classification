Okay so I had to pay $25 to ship it back better than losing $198. Then I come to find out that PayPal had given me an incomplete address, the same one eBay had given them and it was not complete. So now I was getting the package returned to me and I was going to be out the $25 shipping and only had till the 1/26 to return the package or they would rule the case to the seller favor..\n\nSo I called PayPal to see if I could clear it up but I wasn't holding my breath. Anyhow the representative that helped me was Candance. Oh my God what a wonderful human being with such a genuinely great soul. She not only investigated the entire case, but gave me a $25 PayPal voucher and closed my case in my favor because the seller had not provided a complete address! Something an unethical and dishonest seller would do so as to not get the defective merchandise back. Like I said OMG! I am so blessed and fortunate to have gotten Candance to help me. I was so lost and thought for sure that I had lost and been robbed of my $198 but one person that cared enough took the time to follow up and not just do her job but exceeded the jobs expectations but mine as well.
