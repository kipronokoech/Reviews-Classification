Specifically Chinese online stores who scamming people for money without delivering items to people who paid for it. Items never delivered, money will never be returned.\nPayPal will believe the seller, that item was delivered and will never ask you for your evidence. Its obvious, that PayPal has no interest to close scamming online stores and return money to buyers who never benefit from what they have paid for.\nI would like people to know about this problem and avoid using PayPal. This company never will help you to resolve any losses you have. Bank can help you to reverse your money back to your account.\nDon't deal and don't buy using this company. You need someone on your side and to know that you are protected.\nThey don't care and aware of scams but will help only other side, not you.\nSo it's up to you.\nEvidence upon your request.\nThank you.", 'review_date': '2019-02-12', 'review_time': '07:29:08', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
