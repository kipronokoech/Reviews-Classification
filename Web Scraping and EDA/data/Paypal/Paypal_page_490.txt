I had screenshots showing when items had been purchased weeks ahead of when they were stating they received the wrong said item. It showed they were all sold. The buyer of the sold items even left positive feedback. What does Paypal do??? Find favor of the buyer. Ridiculous. I have sold on Ebay for years and know about the scammers out there.
