If you are a buyer then you may learn a new scam.\nThe buyer ordered a $1100 Dyson from us, we had it delivered with tracking. The customer received it and 2 DAYS LATER lodged a dispute that they had received an empty box. No proof, no discussion, no involvement of us (seller whom had proof of what was shipped, weight of the item, camera footage etc, or Courier company to also has weight recorded and can send the actual driver to the door to investiagte), they just handed the buyer their money back\nSo what is stopping anyone buying, receiving the goods and then say the box was empty? Give it a try, you will get your money back from Paypal.\n\nThere are literally dozens of other ways to scam sellers. a Buyer can return any product within 6 months as not described and get a full refund. Imagine you buy a TV and after 3 months your kid breaks the TV, you can lodge a dispute that the TV arrived broken and you just opened the box, you will get a refund.\n\nPAYPAL is a now the platform where you run scams and no longer provides any protection so I would strongly suggest that if you are a seller, get rid of Paypal out of your business.\n\nWe have ripped Paypal out of our business and I expect this will be a growing trend as more sellers get burnt.", 'review_date': '2020-01-16', 'review_time': '08:28:30', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
