Now i'm all for security, preventing fraud and reducing crime, but their 'security measures' are beyond a joke.\nOne of many examples - use my regular ebay and paypal accounts to purchase an item of a significantly low value (£1-£2) from my regular home IP address on my regular laptop and request postage to my registered home address. Transaction is put on hold, account limited. Seller does not post item - causes delays and excess work for me constantly updating my password, security questions etc. This is not a one off, this is for almost every transaction.\nExample two - sell items on ebay, use paypal to pay for postage. Several small payments (£1.90) to the same company (a big well known courier). I receive a call from paypal advising my account is currently being used suspiciously. I confirm that it is intact me paying for postage, jump through a few security hoops and advise that there will be a couple more of these as I am misting things. Customer service agent advises that is fine sir, I was just checking and will put a note on the system. Hangs up. Next transaction I make 'account limited'. I had to redo passwords, security questions again and even send in further copies of my passport. I was absolutely livid!!! I tried to call them straight away on the customer service number on the web site - number not in use.\nI have emailed them several times over the past few months venting my anger in regard to these issues, however I am yet to receive a response.\nOn top of all this, the fees we pay for receiving money are in my opinion, excessive. Especially when you consider that we get nothing back by way of customer service!\nWhat has happened to you paypal? Your management staff need to address these issues as a matter of urgency! Clearly something is wrong when you read the endless amount of negative reviews online.\nIf I could use another payment service I would, however due to paypal being owned by ebay and ebay having a monopoly over the online auction community, I am stuck between a rock and a hard place.....
