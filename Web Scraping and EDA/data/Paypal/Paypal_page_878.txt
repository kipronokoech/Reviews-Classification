"Pay after Delivery" is false advertising. It is actually "Pay after 14 days whether or not the product has shipped". They don\'t even monitor if it has shipped, they simply take the money from your account.\n2.) If you open a dispute for, say, shipping and then close it because it ships, you cannot then open a dispute for the quality of the item. In my case, I was disputing Paypal\'s policy above, not the vendor, but Paypal told me that they had paid the vendor and, because I had opened a dispute, the vendor would not ship me the product so I HAD to close the dispute in order to receive the product. Once I received the product, it was defective but Paypal would not let me open another dispute. How much sense does THAT make?\n3.) The message thread trying to resolve this is so ludicrous and laughable. I received robotic messages from Amira, Justine, Ajantha, Deepa, Norli, Siti Fatima, and Rossi... all equally from Mars in their inability to read an email, understand what is going on, give a darn about customer service, and deliver a relevant reply. It was like pulling a cord on a doll\'s neck, with nonsensical answers being randomly spewed. Apparently they also have no ability to escalate to a supervisor. I\'m guessing this service center is not based in America and these robots have not been properly trained and have no clue what customer service is.
