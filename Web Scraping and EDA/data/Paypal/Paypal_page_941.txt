It\'s also convenient and free to send personal funds to persons in the same country. However, PayPal can be a bit expensive for sellers, especially sellers who\'re already paying through the nose in eBay fees for expensive goods like smartphones and computers. After paying eBay £40 for items £400 or more, there\'s then the PayPal fees to contend with, even though PayPal is an eBay company.\n\nThere should be a reduced fee for sellers who sell through eBay, especially for more expensive goods.\n\nFor buyers, the PayPal experience is generally smooth, unless a buyer has to open a case against a seller who didn\'t provide a good in the allotted time and who is refusing to communicate or respond to the PayPal claims team. In this case, buyers have to wait 10 working days if the seller refuses to communicate before they can get their money back; this is in addition to the 7 days the buyer probably waited already before filing the claim.\n\nAlso, I\'ve also thought that a buyer could defraud a seller by claiming they returned an item when, in fact, they just returned some garbage so they can provide PayPal with a tracking number. Likewise, a seller could potentially defraud a buyer with the same "proof". Thankfully, I haven\'t had any situations like that, either as a buyer or a seller, so I\'m not sure how PayPal would deal with a situation like that.\n\nFor me to give PayPal 4 or more stars, I think they should shorten the time they give non-supplying sellers to respond to 7 calendar days or 7 working days at the most. Also, they should look at a solution that allows eBay sellers who aren\'t business sellers with special rates to receive a slightly lower fee so sellers don\'t just opt for free sites like Gumtree (which, incidentally, is another eBay company last time I checked).', 'review_date': '2012-02-26', 'review_time': '18:36:02', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
