Since then I've made literally thousands of transactions and never needed them for a case resolution. No telling how much money I've made them with my sales and purchases alone. Over the years the company has gotten shadier and shadier and less and less helpful. Last month I got scammed for almost $250 for an item I bought. I caught it within a week and immediately opened a case. At that point it was clearly a scam. Paypal should have first held my money until the seller provided shipment info, and as soon as I opened a case and claimed fraud they should have canceled the purchase and sent my money back. Instead they gave the scammer a week to respond, then another week after that before it escalated and they stepped in. This gave the scammer time to scramble and find an item similar to mine (was a $40 chinese knockoff) and ship it to me. By them providing a tracking number paypal just up and decided in their favor. Now I am stuck with a $40 chinese knockoff that I paid $250 for. No telling how many other people didn't go through all that and just lost their money to that scammer. No contact from paypal, no real person I can talk to, nothing. F%&^ paypal. This is the final straw. Luckily my credit card company got the money back for me.

Basically he was telling me that there is a £68 purchase and these 2 pounds are it's interest. I have never purchased anything but still I searched paypal all the way back to when I became PayPal member but there was no £68 purchase anywhere. I told him I didn't find any such purchase for which he suddenly became furious and kept saying check your account, check your account which I had already checked. Finally i gave up and closed my case thinking it's just £2.. Another one happened today when PayPal credit charged me £390 twice. When I asked, I was given a completely wrong information and upon giving him some screenshots showing he was wrong, agent surprisingly apologised but then another quest ensued of explaining him again what I am after. In the end he was unable to reply satisfactorily and closed my case telling me if you don't reply in 2 minutes I will close. While I was still typing he closed it!!!

Their web interface is not great either. I had a situation where I saw 2 direct debits in my bank account for paypal, and one of them had not been used for years. I deleted the one I had not used, and later went to make a purchase using paypal, and the payment got refused. I also got an email from paypal to say the bank had told them my payment method was no longer valid. So I tried to reinstate the direct debit on their web site, but could not find a way of doing it. So I raised a ticket via a web chat. I waited over an hour and did not get a response, then they sent me an email saying I was no longer online hours later. I replied to the email to say what had happened, and was told I had to be online to sort this out. I tried doing that and waited over an hour before a response, then was put on hold for 30 minutes and a different person came on the chat. He basically said he could not understand what I was asking them to do (reinstate a DD..!) the chat went on for over an hour, and the problem was not resolved and the person I was speaking to drove me to distraction, and kept saying there was nothing he could do, and the DD would reinstate itself eventually by itself but did not know when - absolute rubbish, DD's don't reinstate themselves. They did not resolve the problem. Later on, I realised what the problem was. I had transferred my old direct debits to a new bank account a couple of years before, and the paypal DD I deleted was for the old bank account. I had tried to pay with paypal using the old card that no longer exists as a payment method . The single DD covering the payment methods for my current bank account and debit card was okay. If their email had said which bank had sent an email saying payment method was no longer valid, I would have understood it was the old bank, and understood the problem. All I had to do was delete the old bank's card as a payment method in paypal. But surely they should have understood what had happened by looking at my account properly and seen the difference between 2 different banks. Not to mention the absolute moron I spoke to was incapable of even understanding what I was asking for over an hour, and very unhelpful to the point of being rude - he made me very angry with his attitude and complete incompetence.

I did so for safety and also for foreign currency transactions. PayPal holds the funds of its customers at numerous traditional banks around the world, like Wells Fargo. The balance of any given PayPal customer account is divided among all the bank accounts held by PayPal in the same country. The failure of any one holding bank can not cause a catastrophic loss to any single PayPal customer. PayPal’s global footprint allows customers to readily accept and make paymentS in almost any currency as well as hold foreign currency to hedge against exchange risk. But this is where my praises of PayPal end and soon my business relationship as well, but not before PayPal acknowledges and corrects their mistake summarized below or more aptly attempted theft.\n\nSoon after opening my business account, I created an invoice in the PayPal Business mobile application, which I then sent to my Fortune 500 customer, which they in turn paid by PayPal on the very same day. All done within PayPal. This was reflected on my PayPal Activity Screen and confirmed by my live call to PayPal customer service who added that the funds were subject to a 21-day availability hold due to the payment amount and newness of my account. After 22-days the funds were still on hold according to the PayPal automated phone line. At about 60-days the payment disappeared from the Activity Report and for the first time, the automated customer service line indicated an “adjustment” on 2/5/20 (60-days after the fact) zeroing out the initial payment, almost like the transaction never took place for either party.\n\nUnlike traditional transactions involving two banks, my transaction only involved PayPal giving them the sole ability to alter records for the entire transaction, which they did, and keep money belonging to their customers, which it appears they also did or possibly misdirected the funds to another party. In the end, PayPal will have no choice but to provide me access to funds that are legally mine, likely spurred by audit from the California Office of Business Oversight and/or Georgia Department of Banking and Finance. PayPal will likely claim an “extended hold” for various reasons, none legitimate. This leaves the question of at what point does holding someone’s money become theft, 22, 30, 60, 90-days. Also PayPal has to be held accountable for the harm this has caused my business, or consequential damages that area thankfully addressed by contacting their insurance company not PayPal', 'review_date': '2020-04-25', 'review_time': '02:28:41', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
{'platform': 'Paypal', 'id': '5ea398a4086b6409bc8d2cdf', 'stars': 1, 'title': 'Paypal is full of scams', 'message': 'Paypal is full of scams. First, they don\'t care about issues you are having with someone else, they will hold the money indefinitely if they can, which they have done and continue to do. They have stacks of money piled up sitting in accounts... ok, not sitting, they are investing it in loans, credit cards, stock market, etc, while you the poor sucker is out your item. Next, they will charge you bank account if you decide to do a credit card charge back on them, if you follow their advice to go elsewhere for help. There is no recourse with the bank, because if paypal decide to put your account negative because they feel you owe them due to a credit card charge back, doesn\'t matter if it stems from a dispute you have with someone, your account is negative, so they take it from your bank. You decided to remove your bank account before the dispute, they can still take it in some cases... and you lose your account... and they put it against your credit score/history. Finally, the dispute process, they don\'t care about you, they want to hold the money as long as possible, so good luck getting any resolution in your favor. You think that they care about surveys that you leave for them? NO, they don\'t, absolutely not. I have been doing business through paypal for nearly 21 years, and I still am, and this is my experience with them. I am now using the multitude of other options available, but unfortunately none are as tied to some purchase/sell options on the internet, like ebay. You have to use paypal in many cases, can\'t get around it, not entirely yet. The other services blow paypal out of the water, how much better they are. Paypal is a scam all in itself. Let me give you the most recent example... I bought an item I found through google search. I ordered it, and paid through paypal, on 2/25. I received it, and it was a counterfeit from China. I opened a case through paypal on March 20th. Paypal\'s policy is that you don\'t have to return it, instead destroy it, just take it to the police and get a report, and you get your refund... DId they ask me to do that? No, they didn\'t, despite my complaints about their own policy. I paid, $72 for the item, and they asked me to return it to the sender, which is in China, on and shipping costs $36 as the lowest safest way with minimal tracking. I waited a week for them to tell me to return it, and then when they did they gave me a small window of time to return it, 5days, missing it by a day. They closed the case in the sellers favor. I asked them if I could return it still... they stalled for 5days going back and forth how i missed the deadline, that\'s why the case closed, and to go elsewhere for help... and finally acted dumb like i never asked if i could still return it... and finally said, yes, you can still return it, just give us the tracking number, which I did. THEY TOOK 5days to say yes, you can. WHY??? Anyway, they opened the case. A few days later, for no reason, they closed the case... while the tracking information still shows that it is in route to China. I asked them why have you closed the case. They said because I missed the deadline to ship it. Mind you I dealt with a dozen representatives through messages on their website (not over the ph, messages, due to the coronavirus). I explained to them what had transpired: Counterfeit item, policy is get a police report, a week later they asked me to return it, i did return it, 5days they took to say yes you can return it now even after the deadline as we just wanted you to be prompt, i gave the tracking #, and then "what are we doing now? waiting?" I asked them. Again, they said, sorry, you missed the deadline. "but you said i could return it after the deadline" and they said sorry... still fighting it, and PAYPAL has had the money locked up for over a month now, and they got their chunk of the fees over two months now.
