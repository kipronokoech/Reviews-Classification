I never had an issue. Last year suddenly there was ten 10 dollar charges on my account. I made all the necessary security changes and notified my card holder and PayPal. So they blocked me and when I tried to close my account so I could prevent the risk from occurring again they said I needed to pay them 40 and then I could close after 6 months. I logged on a few times over the months to ensure nothing else was jeopardized and I also saw the account wasn’t closed, and there was never any activity showing. I tried again to close the account, and after hours of trying to get to a customer service rep, I was eventually hung up on without closing the account. By this time I went to bbb. Now after another month in bbb, PayPal is telling me I owe them 10 more dollars then they will close the account. Remember how I checked the account and nothing showed up in my account for months almost 10 months after I paid them 40. So either they can’t keep their information and auditing straight or they are overwhelmed with information and don’t care about their customers. Horrible centric circles of buttons on the site, horrible customer service, horrible accounting practices and horrible business. Run from this company!
