I have regretted the decision to use PayPal business every day since making it. Not only did they charge me for this service, they have held my money for 21 days, even though I have a very good relationship with all my clients. They, of course, immediate took out their fee, which in my opinion is a terrible value. Plus, PayPal "customer service" is the worst I have ever experienced.
