It\'s a scummy business that will try everything to take money from your pocket. If you want buyer protection use a credit card!\n\nI used to swear by PayPal but not anymore. So far this year I have raised 2 disputes with sellers and PayPals responses have been absolutely shocking\n\nDispute 1\nI purchased a jacket but when it arrived it was covered in mold, I tried contacting the seller to set up a return and had no response so I then reached out to PayPal who after waiting 5 weeks said to return the item to the seller to get a refund.\n\nAfter returning I heard nothing and had no contact until 3 weeks later when PayPal said they would not be giving me a refund as "the return never arrived". I checked the tracking and could see the item was successfully delivered to the correct address and signed for by the seller.\n\nI spend hours trying to get in contact with a real person and then spent a further 30 minutes pleading my case to someone who was just reading generic responses from a script. Luckily in the end I was able to speak to another person who understand what had happened and agreed I should get a refund.\n\nSo after nearly 2 months, I was refunded the £210 I spent on the jacket.\n\nDispute 2 (This dispute is currently on going).\nI purchased some trousers from a seller who later in the week decided to cancel the order and issue a refund.\n\nAfter waiting 9 days for the refund to process, PayPal email me and to say the refund was unsuccessful and they will get in contact with the seller to sort the issue.\n\nI then contacted the seller who said PayPal had not reached out to them and I should open a dispute in order to get a refund as they were not sure why the first refund had been canceled.\n\nAfter opening a dispute and adding screenshots of the seller saying I should open one to get a refund they closed the claim in favour of the seller as "A refund had already been processed"\n\nNo, a refund had not been processed, a refund had been started and subsequently canceled by PayPal.\n\nI\'ve tried messaging and calling but all I get are bots.\n\nThis is extremely disappointing as PayPal was always a brand I trusted, I\'ve been using it for 10 years and would always recommend it but not anymore.', 'review_date': '2023-06-09', 'review_time': '20:14:59', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

But again, you can’t use anger or individual anecdotes as proof of a company’s worthiness because most people only post anecdotes or complaints when they’ve had bad experiences. So if you see 90 negative posts out of 100 total it looks like 90% were dissatisfied or even scammed which is not the case. It could be that the 0.01% dissatisfied customers are the ones that post 90% of the posts. Instead do some research into statistics of how many use PayPal successfully vs. how many users are dissatisfied of all TOTAL USERS.\nWhile it is concerning to read, I still say one’s own experience is the best gauge. We have been running a business (multiple in the past but just one now) on PayPal for decades and we keep balances well into the five-figure range (sometimes approaching six figures). We’ve never had any significant issues and we perform an average of two transactions every single day (some days none, other days six or seven transactions). The only issue I personally had was on my personal (not business) PayPal account where many years ago all these automated withdrawals were happening per second (obviously a computer program) and draining my PayPal balance and then my linked bank account. Of course this was scary as hell but they immediately reached out, helped me resolve it and restored all my funds. That was the last significant issue. Other than that the only issue is certain rules and fee changes that can be frustrating or not in my favor, but nothing significant.\nKeep in mind, we use PayPal as a bank as well. We hold funds there for our business until ready to dole them out to the appropriate parties. It is a holding place for us as well as a way for us to take credit card payments by phone with no monthly terminal rental or even service fee. Many of our platforms that process payments on our behalf will issue our business payouts via PayPal as well. We do unlimited transfers of funds to and from our linked bank accounts with never any fees and there are few online services that can do all that, as well as enable you to set up recurring payments and bills, website checkout pages for a business or even event ticket sales with intricate options and pull-down menus (such as for a high school reunion or charity event).\nIt is more versatile and does a LOT more than just allow you to make payments for purchase online, more so than most any of their competitors.', 'review_date': '2023-06-09', 'review_time': '19:58:40', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

I hope karma strikes this company and the individuals who participate in this BS hard!!\n\n\nI will continue to give them hell until I get my full refund.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nI genuinely cannot stand this fraudulent company. Yesterday, I received notification from ScamPal that my remaining cases were denied and closed in the seller\'s favor because of invalid tracking information. I shipped the counterfeit items back to Chinese scammers on June 5th. When I checked the tracking information, the items are currently held in Nanjing, China. The tracking info provided was either fraudulent or there is a genuine holdup in customs. If the tracking information is invalid, then the scammer and PayPal should be at fault, not me. I even expressed my discomfort/concern about shipping the items back to the seller (out of pocket) multiple times. The scammers provided me 3 different addresses, and I was advised by the PayPal executive, Catherine, to ship everything back together to one address. Clearly that didn\'t work in my favor. I HATE this company, and I wish for their swift downfall.\n\n\n25 Jun 2023:\n\nI got a response from the PayPal executive, Anne, after I sent an email about my cases getting closed in the seller\'s favor even though THEY provided an invalid address. Of course I get this useless response:\n\n"I understand that you are disappointed about the outcome of the case. Kindly contact your financial institution to check for options on getting a refund.\n\nI have thoroughly researched the facts of this matter and can confirm our decision remains unchanged. We regret any frustration or inconvenience you have experienced with our services and, while we understand this may not be the answer you were hoping for, we believe our actions to be consistent with PayPal\'s User Agreement."\n\nThey don\'t know their own "PayPal\'s User Agreement" because I get inconsistent responses from customer service and the so called "executives." So, nothing about the "PayPal\'s User Agreement" is consistent. They also want me to try my financial institution to get a refund, but it\'s too late because they drew out this entire process on purpose.\n\nWhat a joke PayPal is. I still don\'t know how they\'re allowed to get away with treating their faithful, trustworthy customers this way. I will definitely stop using them. Meanwhile, I will continue to report them to hopefully get my money back another way.\n\nPayPal is an evil corporation, and I hope they get what they deserve.', 'review_date': '2023-06-26', 'review_time': '01:44:23', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
