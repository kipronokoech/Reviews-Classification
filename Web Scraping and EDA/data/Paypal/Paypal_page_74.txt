After setting up a business account with PayPal, I was shocked to discover that they had placed a hold on my funds for 180 days without any valid reason.\n\nAfter the 180 days were up, I attempted to withdraw the funds to my bank account, only to find that PayPal continued to stall and delay the process. Despite multiple attempts to contact their customer support team and resolve the issue, I was repeatedly given the runaround and told to simply wait another 180 days.\n\nThis experience has been incredibly frustrating and has caused significant financial hardship for my business. It is completely unacceptable for PayPal to withhold funds without valid reason and then refuse to release them even after the hold period has ended.\n\nOverall, I would strongly caution anyone against using PayPal for their business needs. Their lack of transparency and unwillingness to provide satisfactory customer support has left me feeling completely let down and frustrated. I would strongly recommend exploring other payment processing options that prioritize customer satisfaction and fairness.', 'review_date': '2023-04-24', 'review_time': '19:15:21', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
