I did not do the charge-back.\nOver the next 6-7 months, PayPal informed me I was responsible for about 49 more charge-backs against my vice president. I did not do any of them, PayPal made it up, and PayPal\'s actions towards me caused me to lose the business, and everything else, and we almost ended up destitute.\nI turned to the country\'s attorneys for help to no avail, so on or about 6-14-2017 I filed a Civil Rights Complaint in the Superior Court of California CASE#17cv311767 charging PayPal with 4,017 separate counts declaring defamation, slander, libel, fraud, along with numerous violations of the Constitution, and California Penal Codes.\nPayPal hires the legendary powerhouse law firm of Holland & Knight LLP to defend PayPal against my 4,017 lawsuit.\nOn or about 09-26-2017 I lose the lawsuit on a Demurrer for Failing to State a Claim upon which relief can be granted.\nOn or about 01-17-2018, PayPal\'s and their attorneys in a attempt to stop me file Superior Court CASE#18ch007952 PayPal vs Murrow, which is temporary restraining orders against me, against PayPal Inc, and Holland & Knight LLP Head of Security, who is a former Secret Agent of 21 years, and against any of PayPal\'s employees and business\'s who operate other business\'s other than PayPal. The number of people protected by restraining orders against me is staggering.
