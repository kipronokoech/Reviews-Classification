I purchased 2 chairs from a company online through paypal. When I didn't get a confirmation from the company I went to my paypal account just to realize the seller had a different name and no email for me to contact him. I wanted to cancel the order but there was no information. I did a dispute through paypal and they said I had to deal with the seller first. I told them there was no info to contact him. The next thing I knew I got a message that the product was delivered and they had a UPS delivery confirmation. Really?? I saw the delivery confirmation and all looked really good except the weight of the product did not match the weight on the delivery confirmation. So by the time I got to send this information to paypal they had already closed my claim. It was at the end of the day just before this holiday weekend. I will pick this up with them tomorrow and hopefully get somewhere with this scam. After reading the above reviews, I am not so hopeful.
