It is now taking a liberty to delay Refunds from 5 to 30 days. They are dishonest about that it is other banks and not them holding your money, and not giving them back. They are probably investing them and taking the profits without our permission. I had to talk to Manager and request to 'expedite' my Refund to receive it in 3 business days. Now I will think twice before using Paypal for my transactions.......", 'review_date': '2023-10-04', 'review_time': '14:58:44', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

Under UK law it is the supplier who is responsible for the return postage of goods. Paypal refuses to refund me unless I ship the goods back to China at which point I suspect they will simply disappear and I will never get a refund.
