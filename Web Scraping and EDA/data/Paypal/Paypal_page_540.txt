I used PayPal to purchase a toaster oven from an online retailer, which turned out to be a scam. When I didnâ€™t get a shipping notification I opened a dispute through PayPal. The retailer provided a UPS tracking number which showed delivery of a 4 lb item to my area - UPS tracking does not show the exact address, sender or receiver name. The item I ordered weighs about 40lbs. I went back and forth with UPS and PayPal about this, and did everything PayPal asked me to do in order to substantiate my claim, ultimately providing written proof from UPS that the package associated with that tracking number was sent by a different retailer to a different person at a different address in my zip code. Still, they sent me an email today saying that the case is closed and my claim is denied because the retailer provided a tracking number. There are now over 10 recent reviews on Better business Bureau about this retailer describing this exact scam, yet PayPal refused to acknowledge through all of this that I was victim of a scam, even though they are aware, according to news reports which quote PayPal representatives, of this type of scam.', 'review_date': '2020-08-02', 'review_time': '13:24:06', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
