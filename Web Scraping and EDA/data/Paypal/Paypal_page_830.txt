I received a payment on 6th of October - paypal obviosly never messaged me or even showed on my account that a payment was received. I call the custer service team on 8th of November, they tell me they can see a payment at the back end but my account has limitations and I need to fill a form. I should get the fund in 3-7 days from filling the form. Month goes by no money or communication. I finally call them today just to be told there is nothing in the account, they have no clue how their colleague said there was a receipt and all the their customer agents are faffing around like headless chickens passing my call from one department to another. So basically these scamsters have stollen my £223, no wonder paypal's going to be extinct in the next few year - never ever going to use this crap company.....ffs", 'review_date': '2017-12-14', 'review_time': '14:55:28', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

Use alternate methods to transfer payments, avoid PayPal if at all possible. Paypal is not a bank. They operate under their own rules and can and will put limitations on your account for BS reasons. They can freeze all funds in your account for up to 180 day without any warning for any made up reason they chose. If you want to unfreeze your account, you will have to provide them with sensitive information. They will try to extort personal information from you like your SSN and drivers license and even when you provide these you are still not guaranteed that your account will be unfrozen. DO NOT give these criminals your personal information. When you try to call customer support, you will get transferred over to a bunch of con artists who will all tell you that they can't help you unless you give them all of your personal information. You can also ask to speak with to manager and they will connect you to one of their higher up crooks so he can explain to you why you can't have your money. But it's not all bad, your account will only be limited. This means that you have absolutely no access to the money which belongs to you, but at least you can still receive payments so that Paypal can make even more money off interest for the 6 months they are holding your funds. Oh and sometimes they won't get you limited you right away. They will wait until you have left a lot of money sitting in your account and then they will freeze your money and tell you that it is because a lot of money has been flowing through your account and this is viewed as suspicious activity. In reality they are scared you will withdraw all that money and then in case of any charge backs they will have to take a loss so they have decided that they will just hold on to your money and give it to you when feel like it. Also whatever you do, do not withdraw all your money from your account at once. Paypal doesn't like this and if you do so rest assured that you will be hearing from them soon. Don't give these theives your money. If you must use paypal never leave large sums of money sitting in it, for as long as it's in there it is not really your money. One day you will log in and it will all be gone.", 'review_date': '2017-12-14', 'review_time': '02:46:46', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
