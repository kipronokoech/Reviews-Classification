Their representative spoke very poor English, very difficult to understand, and there was a lot of background noise, which didn’t help at all. They wanted a lot of personal financial information which we were very suspect of because we didn’t understand why they needed it or what they would do with it. In the end we canceled the attempted transaction and closed our accounts with both companies. We then read Consumer Reports article on transferring money and found the the recommendation for TransferWise. We contacted them and had a very successful money transfer and a very pleasurable and satisfying experience. We would like to alert people who want to transfer money abroad to definitely NOT use PayPal and Xoom, but to look into using TransferWise or a similar company!', 'review_date': '2019-10-04', 'review_time': '03:47:31', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

Once the money was refunded it was 3 days until I received the refund, which I was told would be iny PayPal balance, they refunded it back to my bank account, at 505 on a Thursday night. Now the money won't clear my bank until monday at the earliest. Called PayPal, because this is already 3 days the money has been in limbo, and their response was that I should contact my bank. I asked to speak to a supervisor. I was already extremely angry and they thought the best practice would be to send me to a supervisor who never answered the transfer and after spending 42 minutes on hold initially I was on hold for an additional 21 minutes with no answer. I feel like this whole practice has been deceptive and shady, from the initial placement of the transfer screen defaulting to add insurance, to the bad information, to the refund being sent after banking hrs and then to sending me to a dummy line on hold until I hung up. I will NEVER use PayPal again. Absolutely disgusting experience!!", 'review_date': '2019-10-03', 'review_time': '23:30:06', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

Ultimately, Paypal claims "the buyers financial institution decides in favor of buyer and Paypal can not dispute the case anymore.." We ask Paypal agent, about returning the nearly $1,500 item in the buyers possession, but the Paypal representative states . . "there is nothing they can do to make the buyer return the item and it is an unfortunate thing that happens".
