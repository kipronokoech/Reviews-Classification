However, I\'ve just lost a small sum of money due to their apparent lie! I bought an item on eBay. The seller sent the wrong item. I was refunded to my Paypal balance, and was told I would NOT BE CHARGED for the transaction. However, the payment left my bank account recently and I was left with NO REFUND! My eBay dispute is closed (as I was refunded), and Paypal won\'t help (as I was refunded). Like eBay, contacting Paypal is nigh-on impossible! Why did Paypal LIE? Why say I would not be charged, and then take (steal) the money anyway? I don\'t think I\'ll ever trust Paypal again! Really annoyed over this, hence the one star! As I said, the amount may be small, but it\'s the principal of the thing. Moral of the story: YOU CAN\'T NECESSARILY TRUST PAYPAL!\n\nUPDATE: The refund has finally appeared in my Paypal balance after a whopping 9 days (probably because I kicked up a fuss). So, WHY did Paypal say "You will not be charged for this transaction" then take the money anyway? The upshot is my TRUST in Paypal is now DAMAGED! Moral of the story, although this was a small amount (it could just as easily been a larger amount), NEVER TRUST ANYBODY WHERE MONEY IS CONCERNED (especially larger amounts). Follow that advice, and you won\'t go far wrong.\n\nI\'ve upgraded Paypal to 3 Stars (Average), as I don\'t think I will trust them fully again!

Funny I think there were people at my house all day and no one has seen said package or heard anyone knocking. Never can find it. Contact the Postal Service and they do a search. Turns out the package didn't come to my house but was delivered somewhere else. After much research the tracking for this package never was addressed to me and was delivered to the house that that was electronically logged from the shipper at the time of p/u. Spend several weeks fighting with PayScam that the package didn't get delivered to me and their only answer is that they deny my claim because the seller has a confirmed delivery report. PayScam refuses the paperwork supplied by the Postal Service showing where the package was delivered, first because they couldn't see the USPS logo and then after I get the Postal Inspector to provide a complete form showing not only the address and logo, I get the same crappy form response, still denying my claim because the sell has a confirmed delivery ticket.
