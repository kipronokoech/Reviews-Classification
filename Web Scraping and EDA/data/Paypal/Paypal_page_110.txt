They suppose to represent buyer interest and protect buyer’s rights. Unfortunately PayPal doesn’t do it. Or maybe it was before and they don’t do it now.\n\nThe whole story is about -- I have tried to buy a product from, ops – I didn’t check the company, Hainshow.com (scammer). They accepted a payment from me through the PayPal and …silence…\n\nI wrote to Hainshow.com and PayPal, there was a silence again. After a month I received a note from USPS that the product was successfully delivered. I was not lazy and visited my USPS office. I found that Hainshow used another address and another addressee on the shipment. Maybe I would stop my investigation, but the prove-photo from USPS delivery guy, there was a small package. I orders a product and it would be about 5-6 pounds, definitely not small package.\n\nI wrote another message to PayPal with this accident that Hainshow collected several buyers and sent all of them the same tracking number. One buyer got the order; others got nothing because USPS shows that the order was delivered.\n\nAgain, I visited my USPS office. The USPS delivery guy showed me the picture of the package with a different name, different address but the same tracking number. I made copies and sent to PayPal.\n\nWow, PayPal didn’t want to do anything, or someone didn’t want to do a real investigation. They just closed the case.\n\nIf you ask me what I did – I broke the relations with PayPal and wrote them, that they hadn’t followed their promises, they didn’t protect buyer’s rights and they didn’t spent time for the investigation.\n\nMy concern they are not qualified for presenting buyer’s rights on the web. Maybe you are luckier, but I don’t. I can see there are more complaints, so, I am assuming it is a SYSTEM to lie to their customers.\n=Andre Morua', 'review_date': '2023-01-27', 'review_time': '01:40:43', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
