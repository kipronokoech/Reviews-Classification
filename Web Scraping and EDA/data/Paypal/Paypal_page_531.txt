I tried transferring the funds to my bank account, which proved to be difficult. After failing to transfer funds, my tenant requested the funds back for withdrawal so she can pay me cash. I transferred the funds back only to find out that now I owe PayPal $263. I tried calling PayPal and filing a claim as to why I am being charged for the money I just transferred back. I couldn't get a hold of anyone. PayPal ruled the case in favor of my tenant and told me that my tenant's bank never released the funds and that I am responsible for the transaction. What I don't understand is why PayPal made it look like the funds where in my account and why am I paying for the money that never reached my account. Both PayPal and my tenant knew that the money never reached my account but they made it look like it was there. I cannot seem to get this resolved with PayPal. I have appealed this case many times but they dismiss it without even letting me talk to a representative. If anyone should pay for this shouldn't it be my tenant who cheated me by stopping the funds and PayPal who made it look like the funds where in my account?", 'review_date': '2020-08-14', 'review_time': '02:32:32', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
