I continued with my day, and continued to check my email.\n\nI wake up on 5/6/23 and see that PayPal is now demanding proof I earned the money legitimately, a copy of my LLC paperwork, and a copy of my ID, all of which I provided. I additionally had my client sign paperwork stating that the transactions were paid out in full for work done. After I submitted that, they wanted detailed explanations of each invoice, all of which I provided.\n\nI got an email an hour after stating that they were going to be locking my account permanently, and the money in the account was going to be held for an extended period of time, no doubt so they could try to make a few bucks by loaning it out.
