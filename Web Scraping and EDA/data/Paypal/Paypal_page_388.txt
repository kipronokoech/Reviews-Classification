So a little background out of the blue in the middle of the pandemic (Summer 2020) I got a random message from PayPal saying they were suspending my account for what they deemed "abusive behavior" which they wouldn\'t explain to me and they froze all the money I had in my account for 6months. I tried to get an explanation which I didn\'t get of coursem Well fast forward to December and I find out that they (Paypal) cleaned out all the money in my account for no reason. I called the customer service again and was told that they can take my money without explanation and would not return the funds.

I ordered some custom mugs and flasks from a company online. I ordered two sets of mugs and two flasks. They sent the two flasks but only one set of mugs. They were to be delivered within 12 days. I did not receive them after a month. i sent them an email. No response. They were to be for Christmas. finally I only received the partial order 2 days before Christmas. I emailed for a refund. They ignored me. I filed with Paypal. I sent copies of the receipt that showed what I paid for. The company sent a receipt to paypal that showed what they MAILED in which the total did not add up to what I paid. Paypal did not understand this. After numerous emails explaining this, and two months after Christmas, the company sent me the rest of the order, but they were chipped at the top and clearly came from a pile of seconds. I sent a picture to paypal and said I wanted a refund, not damaged goods two months late. Now they want me to mail these back, at my expense and provide proof that I mailed them back. In all of this they requested that I file a criminal complaint against the company and provided me with an online form to do so.. Once I did, they ignored that as well. They simply fail to fully understand the issue. Terrible customer service and failure to respond appropriately to the situation.', 'review_date': '2021-02-17', 'review_time': '21:41:39', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

I expressed my objection and told them that "because I agreed to the paypal credit the money should be taken automatically every month". Guy said that they cannot take it without my permission (In my opinion I gave them permission once I agreed to paypal credit agreement) - but that\'s ok I thought. After call I logged on and set everything up with message saying that right know money would be taken every month. Second month - guess what?\nSame story. I\'ve explained that I had done everything what was required and lady said that I hadn\'t. Fair enough. I repaid the credit in full and closed account.
