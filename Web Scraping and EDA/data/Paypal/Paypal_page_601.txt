It cost PayPal virtually nothing to keep our account open and to charge us the $30 a month. Upon figuring this out and closing the account, they would not even consider refunding us anything. Not to mention, you can\'t even talk to a human. You can only dispute through their web chat feature with has all virtual responses unless you trick the system. Terrible customer service and a truely terrible experience in requesting a refund. All I got was a broken english response and no consideration for refund. "This is a subscription for the PayPal Pro and it\'s been 6 months of no use , Should have called us earliest as you are not using it". Pretty much Big Business giving the middle finger to small business. Pretty much a "Thank you, don\'t let the door hit you in the butt on the way out".

In December 19, my card was stolen and changed it with a new card. Apparently £7 payment has rejected by my bank when Paypal contacted them which I wasn't aware of.

Then a couple of months later i have found that my credit score has a bad mark because of this. PayPal gave me a bad credit score immediately for £7 despite of many years i have been with them and never had this issue. Any professional company with their long term existing clients would be more sensitive and caring and would call them or text them directly to inform rather than sending an invisible email (By the way, i cannot still find any email from them). Instead of doing that they gave me a bad credit score and also charged me interests. Because of that, now i am having difficulties on my business purchases. This undeserved bad score has been affecting my business terribly. I closed my account with them now. They weren't helpful at all.They didnt even offer an apology.
