One guy decided to send me a friends and family payment for approximately ¬£8. Shortly afterwards he notices an outgoing payment from his paypal account stating ¬£600 had been sent out. I check my paypal account and received the ¬£8 - not ¬£600. He contacts Paypal and his bank. His bank promptly process a chargeback and I get a message from paypal saying a resolution case has been opened and a chargeback is in process.\n\nAnyway, something is clearly not right here and somehow the Paypal platform has been compromised. I respond to the case detailing the ¬£8 friends and family payment - I was under the impression these payments could not be reversed. My account details: Transaction amount: ¬£7.45 Disputed amount: ¬£604.85 GBP? Paypal state they will fight the chargeback. A few weeks later I get an email saying they have charged me a chargeback fee of around ¬£14 and the case remains ongoing.\n\n3 months later I get emailed to say the case has been closed and the chargeback could not be reversed. On principal I should not have been charged a further ¬£14 - something on their side has allowed this issue to happen and the platform must be lacking security somewhere.\n\nI have tried to contact them online but don't get any human response back. I also sent an email to their formal complaints department and got a response saying the email address is no longer in use. It maybe a small amount of money but on principal I want it back - trying to contact them is ridiculous. So despite what they say about friends and family payments - be warned they can be reversed through no fault of your own and then you get slammed with a further fee.", 'review_date': '2020-06-05', 'review_time': '11:41:55', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
