My bank account associated with my PayPal account was hacked last November. Luckily, we saw that the hacker had taken 6 payments through PayPal and when they emptied one account, they started transferring money from another of our accounts. We called the bank, they reported 4 of the 6 charges to PayPal and credited our account for the losses. They did not pay PayPal for 2 of the charges so that remained as a negative on my PayPal account. I don't use this account, I set it up for my father and was not aware of its status. A week ago we got a letter from a collection agency saying we owed PayPal for the negative balance caused by the hackers. We tried to find a phone number to talk to customer service - there is no phone number, there are no people you can call. You have to use their Chat messaging system. When I explained the above to the Chat customer service agent - and it takes them HOURS to respond, I was told that I owed the money and there was nothing they could do. I re-emphasized that we were hacked, I never ordered or received anything, and I do not owe PayPal anything. I was again told I was out of luck. I told them that they better either credit my account or I will file a complaint with my state's attorney General, secretary of state and Better Business Bureau and tell everyone I know, online and off, that PayPal is dishonest and is committing fraud. For whatever reason, my issue was finally escalated to the next level and I was told that my case was would be reviewed since we had also filed a dispute. It took a few more days, but I finally had my account credited. I also had to call the bill collector, who said they would return the file to PayPal. I tried to close the account, but it won't let me do it online - so I had to go through the whole thing again using Chat and was told I had to call PayPal Credit, which is different than PayPal. I tried to call the number, but that is a robotic system that could not recognize my phone number or last 4 of my SS number - I could not talk to an agent as the phone just kept ringing and then hung up on me. PayPal is the biggest scam, with absolutely NO CUSTOMER SERVICE. The people I am Chatting with are in India as far as I can tell and have no way to solve any problems efficiently.
