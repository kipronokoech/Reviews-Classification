Asked for more information, so a third party was hired to provide a true report and assessment, this is apparently still not good enough,so now they need to sit, ruminate & digest in their back office. Customer service agents are hired from Phillipines (I venture a guess), try to convince you that you have said things you haven\'t e.g. "you said you uploaded evidence yesterday" when it was uploaded 5 days ago - then raise their voice when you object to it. Should be commended on their achievements for miscommunication throughout this organisation and poor communication across their departments, even their resolution dispute estimate is inaccurate. Don\'t question this or the agent will address you like you\'re stupid because you should know there\'s another 10 days to wait (like duh ??). Incompetent clowns and unprofessional and unreliable. Have lost faith in this company. Oh before I forget, don\'t expect their customer agents to liaise with their back office team, apparently they don\'t speak to each other, another stupid question should you ask, is why. Honestly you would get a better outcome asking a bot, at least it\'s polite courtious and communicates without being condescending.\nUtter joke and catastrophic fail - Shame on you PayPal.', 'review_date': '2020-10-27', 'review_time': '05:09:54', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

The seller says they were delivered. Their delivery point was a drop box 1500 miles away from me at an address I know nothing about and have never been near. I complained to paypal and last week I get the reply from Paypal that my appeal of this charge has been denied because the seller can prove they delivered the order.
