(new eBay seller, I understand PP holds policy but tried requesting for funds on hold after meeting requirements stated on PayPal's website)\n\nA rep told me to email Proof of Delivery from courier so they can lift the hold as tracking info shows the depot only as the last destination. Rang back PP to inform that I have emailed the POD, next rep said it's not a valid proof! How silly are their next reasons for refusing to lift the hold:\n\n1. the signatory last name who received the parcel is different from the buyer's last (delivery address matches address on PP account). Right. Everyone living under the same roof should share the same last name!\n\n2. The rep asked me what I need the funds for, I said I need it to pay for the item. She then asked how did I manage to deliver the item when I haven't paid for it? And added she's not sure anymore what I delivered. Don't know if these people are clowns. I told her I got it on credit and I need the money asap, now that the buyer has received the item in good order.\n(Escalated to a supervisor)\n3. The delivery address is 45 kms away from the depot (when they checked Google maps to verify the address) and they can only lift the hold manually within 15 km radius of the final delivery destination as per tracking info online. (They won't consider POD - not on their policy) So I asked what about if it's 16km? 17km?.... etc. I was told it comes down to their discretion. So what about 45 kms? Nah too far.\n(the 45km rule is internal PP info btw, and not supposed to be divulged to customers. But everyone I spoke to mentioned about the 45km policy to). I asked if I can find that on the T&C or User Agreement. Answer is NO. It's their discretionary internal policy.\n\n4. The supervisor said another solution is to get the buyer to contact us to verify receipt. Rang back PayPal to verify if this is correct before I bother the buyer. Another supervisor said NO, there's no way we can lift the hold.

The man I spoke to was very friendly and easy to understand (unlike Romwe’s employees), and he agreed immediately that something very fishy was going on. He told me PayPal doesn’t even HAVE the ability to hold onto anyone’s money for any reason, and that Romwe was just making stuff up. He told me to stop communicating with Romwe, that PayPal would take care of the whole thing. And PayPal did. They pushed the dispute along much further to a claim (something like that), giving Romwe only ten days (much shorter than the usual allotted time frame) to give me my money back or they’d be in legal trouble.
