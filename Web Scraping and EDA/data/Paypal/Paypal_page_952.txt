I shouldnt have to get in depth with this review. Paypal has been robbing people for years but due to their large amount of users, they can screw you over with no remorse, and not worry about you coming back. They are just a big company that is unstoppable due to their ammount of users. I highly reccomend NOT giving them any information because If 1 sketchy, scamming buyer decides to make a purchase from you, paypal can hold all of your funds for over 6 months. If you do get your funds back after a limitation, I suggest you withdraw ASAP, and atleast have a different credit card issued to you. You do not want this company with your current information, if you use them, GET A NEW CARD AFTER!', 'review_date': '2012-01-16', 'review_time': '19:53:43', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
