Example: sold Ebay item and received PayPal payment earlier this year. Owner of eBay account files dispute claim because allegedly someone had bought the evoucher with their details. PayPal debit my PayPal account of the cost plus £14 fee because “buyer” had invoked a chargeback whilst investigations are carried out. Fine, PayPal are apparently hit for £100 for every successful chargeback claim so I can understand they’d want to recoup some loss from me. The “lousy” part comes from 1) promising me as a gesture of goodwill they’d knock off the £14 fee (they didn’t). 2) Wait times usually exceeding 30 minutes to get through (and it’s a minefield just to talk to someone). 3) The inconsistent information given to me by different reps. 4) The number of times I’ve been cut off when asked to be placed on hold while they look into my account notes boils my blood! Do they ever call me back? Not in a hell’s chance 5) The general feeling the staff aren’t trained to the level I have been used to just in the manner they speak.
