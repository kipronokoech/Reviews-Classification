I called several times, and they refused to let me use another account to pay. The last time they called, they transferred me to eBay, which was were the fees came from. I paid the fees with my other account online, which is what the person from eBay said would solve the problem. Today, I talked to someone else from Paypal, and they said I didn\'t need to pay eBay\'s fees directly on the site and that they will continue to take money out of my account with the negative balance (which repeatedly keeps getting overdraft fees, so I can\'t deposit enough in that account to get out the negative). The guy on the phone was reluctant to answer my questions today. I paid the fees I owed eBay, but Paypal keeps taking my money, incurring yet even more overdraft fees. On top of that, they said I can\'t use another account (the one I used to pay eBay) to pay the $1.10 I "owe" Paypal. The person I talked to said "We are trying to get the money back that we gave to eBay from your account. You shouldn\'t have paid eBay." This all happened because they didn\'t take out my shipping and listing fees out of my Paypal account automatically, like they were supposed to. The person I talked to on the phone today said that the fees should have automatically come out of my Paypal balance BEFORE I transferred it to my bank account, which obviously didn\'t happen. Every time I call Paypal, I can never get a straight answer, because they always tell me different things.

If this is simply for backup then it is unacceptable. No other payment system I have used works this way. Hilariously this means that if I no longer own the card, due to loss or account termination, I am unable to ever remove it if I continue to use Paypal. Errrr.... okay. It also means I have no way of controlling my own account spending.\n\nEven more frustrating is the fact that currently my old address is linked to this card. I cannot however remove the address untlll I edit the card and input the security code, which I cannot do because I no longer have the card. This means I have an old address linked to the account which comes up constantly when making payments, increasing the chance of making a mistake in shipping and reducing my desire to use Paypall if there is any alternative. Smart.\n\nEqually frustrating is Paypal's habit of offering up every single address I have ever used with the system every time I use it as a payment with a merchant. There is seemingly no way of editing this ever expanding list of friends, work addresses and old residence. Utterly useless.\n\nI remember contacting Paypal three times with questions relating to these gripes several years ago. They did not bother replying to me.
