So I called, explained I have a new number and I forgotten my password etc, the lady needed the last 4 digits of my bank card to access my account to update my number and password etc and to investigate this fee someone was trying to spend.. which I also had no idea what card it was linked to!\nFrom almost 10 years ago I think my bank card has changed atleast 4 times since then! Anyway, I tried remembering multiple cards I had in the past .. none worked Ofcourse! But she mentioned looking at an old payment I maybe made and which card was on the invoice, when she said that I found my last payment email receipt in my emails from 2016 for a purchase on eBay!\nSo I logged into my eBay account and looked at my old cards I had registered with them to than boom! Found the right one and had access to my account!\nShe has updated my mobile number and helped me reset my password aswell as put an investigation on the fees that were trying to be spent today.\nWith all of this hard work helping me access my account she was at complete ease and also offered to stay on the line while I checked I could log in after the branch had closed at 6:30pm she said she was happy to stay and make sure I could log in, so very kind! I told her it’s ok but if I had any issues I would call back.. however I have finally after 6 years been able to log back into my account and decline that fee someone was trying to spend all because of her help!\nGreat customer service if you ask me!\nAdvising me on ways to try and find the card it was linked to by looking at old emails and invoices etc shows dedication to help customers because I wouldn’t have even thought about it!\nOr maybe I got lucky due to the other reviews, who knows but the lady I spoke to I cannot thank enough :) she was extreamly polite and professional but also very kind and genuinely wanted to help.\nThank you !', 'review_date': '2022-12-08', 'review_time': '21:15:53', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
