I sold an item on Ebay to a person in Miami, Florida. I was charged a "Fee" on my PayPal account thinking this was the percentage that Ebay keeps from the purchase. To find that PayPal charges per transaction as well as extra for overseas transactions. PayPal disguises such fees labeled as "fee" so you do not know what exactly is it referring to or charging you for. Even better, you cannot find the details of transaction anywhere in your account.\n\nI went back and forth with maybe 5 reps at PayPal. I was charged an overseas fee for shipping my item to Florida. I live in Illinois. I brought this to PayPal\'s attention, they stated that this individual had a "over borders" transaction. From a purchaser/selling perspective in the PayPal Account there is not a clear distinction between international and non international accounts. As I would think most customers would agree that this would be based off the mailing address. I asked where exactly I could see that this person had an international account and they could not tell me. Very informative and professional.\n\nAs far as I know, PayPal could be telling any customer/seller that every transaction fee is overseas. It doesn\'t matter to them, they can keep the money even though they don\'t have the evidence.', 'review_date': '2018-08-17', 'review_time': '05:42:10', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
