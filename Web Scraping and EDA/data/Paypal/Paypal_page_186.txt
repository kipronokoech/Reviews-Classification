I try to make a purchase using PayPal and when I select “place order” it shows the transaction failed and to try later. The first time this happened I tried a few times and although the sale did not go through the charges did multiple times and I spent hours trying to fix the mess. I ended up ordering direct using my Mastercard. The 2nd time this happened I tried to place an order and got the same “failed” after having gone through this before I decided to check and sure enough the payment is “pending” after calling I confirmed twice that JCPenney had no record of any order. Since it failed I had no order number and they tried using different information to try finding the non existing order. PayPal refuses to remove the pending transaction for this. I have spent hours trying to explain this to PayPal and they keep telling me I have to cancel this order that DOES NOT EXIST. And they refuse to help. Their solution was to wait 30 days and then file a dispute. That is ridiculous. The order does not exist. They are no help whatsoever and not worth the hassle.

I've been a paypal customer for 12 years and I've closed it right away because of my frustrations.\n\nI am glad Ebay dumped Paypal because Paypal is a scammer's friend. It is easy to track that the item was delivered intentionally to the wrong address but they did not do an investigation at all.\n\nI urge everybody to stop using Paypal because they have not helped me atall in any transanctions over the course of 12 long years.\nPlease avoid Paypal.
