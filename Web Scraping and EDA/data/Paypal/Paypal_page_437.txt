I have had what I would say is the WORST customer service experience of my life with them over the last two days. I have used a Paypal fairly often in the past but I will NEVER use them again. I attempted to use their installment payment option. Their site malfunctioned and charged me the full amount of the purchase which was several hundred dollars as well as pulling money out of my account for the first of the 4 installment payments. I tried calling Paypal immediately. I was on hold for almost 30 minutes. Then when I did reach a person, they were rude and unhelpful and basically told me they couldn\'t/wouldn\'t help me and that I had to call the business I\'d bought from. I filed a dispute with PayPal and then called the business I\'d ordered from. Paypal had not sent this business the funds they\'d taken from my account so the business could not refund the money. I tried Paypal again and waited for 20 minutes to speak with someone. I asked to speak to a manager. The person I was talking to ignored my request and kept talking over me. I insisted again that I wanted to talk with a manager. I was placed on hold while this person "looked" for a manager. I waited for more than 10 minutes and the person I\'d been talking with came back and said his manager was busy and wouldn\'t talk with me. He was zero help and the issue is still unresolved and Paypal took two payments out of my account, one of the payments was not authorized by me. They are a horrible business with terrible customer service. I am done with them and strongly discourage anyone from using them. They have been rude and dishonest. I don\'t trust them.', 'review_date': '2020-12-11', 'review_time': '07:15:19', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

I thought I\'d add my experience to the pile. They are a trumped up bank that seem to think they are above the law.\n\nFor context I have been a PayPal user since 2004.\n\nHere are some problems I have encountered:\n\nHolding money, and then not releasing the money within agreed time frame, making me contact them\n\nDiscouraging me from calling by hiding their customer service details behind a robot that can\'t answer my question (and then just loops back, doesn\'t give me their contact details)\n\nHolding money without due reason, it comes up with "why your money was held" and none of the reasons match you. As above, you then have to ring them to get it released as you wait and wait and wait and it passes the release date and it still is held.\n\nUnable to create a direct debit for PayPal credit using my joint account, because my partner is already using the account number on her own PayPal credit facility.\n\nWhen opening PayPal credit, advertising credit agreement as X over Y months, for Z fee, but then opening a \'credit card\' type facility as well. Giving me an account limit of thousands of pounds outside of the credit I wanted when I did not ask for this. Not giving me the option to say no to this, saying no means not getting the credit agreement.\n\nRefusing to change my legal name after receiving a legally binding document, and asking for several other pieces of evidence. It would have been quicker to delete my account and create a new account in my new name.\n\nGiving money back to people without going through due process. PayPal grossly favours the sender, it is not an impartial judgement.\n\nThere are more but my arms grow weary. If I write them all up I\'ll probably be here all night.\n\nI would say "avoid" but who else are you gonna use?', 'review_date': '2020-12-10', 'review_time': '16:01:46', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
