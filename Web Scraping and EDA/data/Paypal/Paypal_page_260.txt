I get error message saying contact bank.\nSo I call them and tell her the issue and she says to me that I need to contact Facebook.. so then I talk to my card issuer which is not PayPal number , it’s card number anyhow basically what happened is now she says that this card cannot be used for anything except receiving checks and stuff that’s why I can’t use this account to sell a few items on fb r u friggin kidding me?!', 'review_date': '2021-10-31', 'review_time': '22:11:39', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

They said once I file a dispute with my card company they can\'t handle the case, it\'s out of their hands and they refuse to issue the credit to my card company. Card company says they can\'t credit, they don\'t have it, Paypal does. I wanted to "escalate" the charge with Paypal, they ignored my request.
