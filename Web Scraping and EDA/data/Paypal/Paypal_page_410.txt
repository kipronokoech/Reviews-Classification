They stole my money by limiting my account with a ridicilous reason. Although I have a confirmed bank account with My ID etc., they say that My account has been limited because I have another unconfirmed bank account. Yes because I don’t use online banking with that account, thats why I registered a new confirmed one. Furthermore they did it after I sent money to my balance for online shopping so that they can use my money illegally. And I can not even remove unconfirmed bank account because they dont let me. Anyway people, stay away from this disgusting so called company. What I still can’t believe, they do this in Europe where I pay advovate insurance every month.
