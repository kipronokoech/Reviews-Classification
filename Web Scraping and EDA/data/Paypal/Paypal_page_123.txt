In my experience, PayPal has consistently demonstrated a lack of reliability and transparency when it comes to holding and releasing funds.\n\nIn particular, I have encountered numerous instances where PayPal has promised to release funds to my clients, only to renege on that promise without any valid justification. In some cases, my clients have had to retain legal representation and engage in costly legal proceedings in order to retrieve their funds.\n\nOverall, PayPal's frequent failures to follow through on their commitments and their lack of accountability make them a highly unreliable financial service provider. I strongly recommend seeking alternative options for online payments and financial transactions.", 'review_date': '2022-12-24', 'review_time': '03:34:11', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

Zero protection against fraud, that same fraud they say they fight to protect customers. Zero. They\'re withholding my funds right now - they can do up to 180 days, and they\'re ignoring my messages. Literally ignoring my messages, like a teenager blocking you on WhatsApp. And don\'t even get me started about their fees... all they have is a monopoly, and a lot of people who have no other means to make their payments.

First I bought a $1103 laptop for my son\'s xmas present and then I ordered clothes for my dog ND lastly with $148 left in my account I ordered my son some clothes that were on SALE from the adidas site..my total purchase was $76.12 and my savings on that purchase was $72.50\nPaypal charged me the $76.12 and $72.50 and that put me behind $3 for my earlier laptop purchase.\nFreaking out I raced to my bank to add more money to my account before best buy tried to take the money upon shipping it and I noticed once I got to the bank that paypal did a "payment correction" for $3!! At this point I\'m thinking this doesn\'t look like a computer error.\nSo buyers beware do not use paypal. They\'ve become scammy.\nI\'m gonna close my account and start using prepaid credit cards again.
