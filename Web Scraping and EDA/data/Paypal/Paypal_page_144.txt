Compared to other people's experiences that I have been reading, guess what, dejavu all over again and again and again. Yup, for me there is no difference to many of the other reviews that score Paypal 1 star or less if they could. Well, I am placing this review so that it becomes registered as another 1 star. I plan to register my negative review about Paypal with every other review site that will accept the 1 star register. Paypal have not been ethical with me. Let my register be a warning for others. No I will never ever use Paypal again. And it is no wonder that Paypal were trying to instigate their $2500.00 fee across the board. It was to stop people writing poor reviews about Paypal. So, to Paypal I say this. You frigged me around and stiffed me for a couple of lousy dollars. You lied, again and again and again. I am sure there is no point in sending Paypal to the naughty corner again. They have worn the floor in the naughty corner out. Pack of morons! So how's that loss of 85 billion dollars goin off yer shares. I sit in disbelief to think that Paypal has screwed me and other customers for a few bucks and proceed to wipe off 85 billion dollars off their share market value and still going down. Who was the loser that pushed that stupid perverse $2500.00 narrative; about people that Paypal were trying to call mischevious with their mindsets and should be fined. Jokes on you Paypal stooges. ( Urban dictionary regarding the word stooge) Someone that always complains about other people yet is a failure themself. It's very refreshing now that Paypal have had their narcistic mentality exposed in the latest headline grabbing news. $2500.00. Bet Paypal will remember that figure.\nHahahahahahahahahahah..........
