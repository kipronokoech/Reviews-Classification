I don\'t even hold a balance in paypal.\n\nIn the "Help" section it says that\n\nUnfortunately, we are unable to continue offering our services to you at this time due to the nature of your business and the risk it poses to PayPal.\n\nWhat nature of my business? What business? I\'ve used it pretty much to buy many items from ebay, and the items I\'ve sold on ebay I could count on one hand, furthermore my ebay positive feedback is 100%, so no issues there.\n\nFinally I got through to someone on Facebook who seemed to be helpful, and apologised for the issue. They said they would refer it to a specialist and the specialist would get back to me soon.\n\nThis was nearly 4 months ago. Guess what? No response.\n\nNow they want to charge an annual fee too. Judging by the reviews on here with a 1.2 rating and 84% are 1 star reviews it seems paypal has gone way down hill.\n\nI also doubt that I would regain access to the account anymore, if paypal thinks I\'m being unfair in this review then they\'re free to contact me to agree to a resolution, however I doubt I will hear anything back.', 'review_date': '2021-01-25', 'review_time': '16:35:27', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

So now 6 weeks later I was wondering how am I going to get to there customer service, I stated looking into them more thru google, then I found out all about PayPal. Finally I was just going to refund the funds back to the company, and I got a message telling me we need to get in touch with the Aldi that gave you the refund to make sure everything is legit. It took them 8 weeks to investigate if i was legit to finally receive my $18 check, let me tell you one thing it was not worth it. One example I will say is if someone told me they would give me $200 to use PayPal account for anything for free my answer would be NO.
