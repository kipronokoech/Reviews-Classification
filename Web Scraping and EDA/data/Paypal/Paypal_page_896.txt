Perhaps he knows when a ship is so badly damaged it can sink. Just look at this example of Ebay charges: To list a CD on EBay is 35p on an asking achieved sale price of 0.99p in auction plus 25p final value fee which is calculated at 10% on the total transaction ie: 0.99p plus £1.50p p&p = 0.25p final value fee (or if you want to be exact about it it's 0.249p), which means after selling your CD you have to deduct from the total of £2.49p the sum of 60p which leaves you £1.89p. A cheap jiffy bag (and you will have to put some cardboard in it to strengthen it!) to send a CD is around 50p in the UK and second class ordinary postage is £1.17p so add these together and you have £1.67p to deduct from your £1.89p which leaves you 22p to pay your paypal fee when the buyer uses paypal. Wow! This is crazy economics and in my opinion a seller could be wiser to throw the CD away or wait for the free listings to come round again. And all this without the items you buy that don’t match the descriptions and have to be sent back tracked or recorded at the buyer's expense. It takes ages to get verification too and there is no Email address for either Paypal or Ebay so you have to make expensive phone calls to sort anything out. What these people need is competition. Someone also needs to explain to them the meaning of the word SOLD. An item isn't sold until it's paid for. So sending sellers Emails to say items are sold when they are not paid for is a complete waste of the seller's time. Many buyers give addresses that don't exist and fees are lost. Many don't pay either. Will EBay and PayPal be sold off soon? I hope so. If there's a bet on it at the bookies I'll go for it.", 'review_date': '2014-06-28', 'review_time': '09:35:27', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

My name is xxxxxxx and I am happy to assist you. PayPal does reserve the right, as indicated in our User Agreement, to limit the funding source for any individual payment. This is listed under section 3.4 of our Payments Policy. Our internal security system takes into account several factors to assess the risk associated with a transaction. This is similar to the way other banks and credit card companies work. We use complex statistical models to identify extraordinary transaction patterns. This does not mean however that either party is acting in a dishonest or fraudulent manner. We realize that this is very frustrating experience but the security and integrity of our system is considered paramount. Regrettably this leads to us occasionally denying a small number of payments. If you would like to contact PayPal."\n\nSo far they haven\'t explained how making a purchase online, from one of the world\'s largest retailers, using Paypal\'s shopping cart, my email address, my correct password, my correct phone number, to access money already collected and present in my Paypal account represents "extraordinary transaction patterns".\n\nContrary to their stated position. NO BANK, and NO CREDIT CARD COMPANY has ever denied such a straight forward transaction regarding a fully funded account.\n\nNow, normally this would merely be an annoyance but the purchase in question was for something desperately needed, and my life was put in danger by Paypal\'s refusal.
