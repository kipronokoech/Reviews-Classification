On this particular occasion I changed my phone number. I added the new one and everything went through ok. I did this whilst still having access to the old number as I knew they'd sent s confirmation number for verification purposes to the old number which is fair enough. Anyway days later I go to log in!!!! Yet again , despite changing my number and deleting the old number within settings etc it sends a text to the old never!! What good is that? I try to log in but it won't let me prompting me to ring customer care. I try this no one available!! It offers you a different number to ring. However you can't hear it as it's muffled when it's been recorded. It goes on and on. People may find this but picking. But when you've had so many problems with PayPal , everything with them becomes a chore. They have lost me so much business selling on eBay with their ridiculous payment holds or then not releasing funds as promised 24 hours after parcels have been delivered . I could go on and on and on. I'm guessing by the fact there is over 80 percent 1 star feedback for PayPal on this site others are have similar problems. It's about time some authority stepped in and sorted these clowns out. Why should we have to put up with the fact you have no choice on eBay but to use PayPal meaning they have no competition and no need to improve. They are dreadful in every single way. Absolutely the worst company I have ever dealt with. We should be allowed to offer 0 stars which is what I'd give. 1 star is too good for PayPal.", 'review_date': '2020-03-16', 'review_time': '08:09:56', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
