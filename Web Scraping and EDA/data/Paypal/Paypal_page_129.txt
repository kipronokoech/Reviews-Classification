They has verified me several times, the sender of funds was family, but they could not release this 24 hour hold.\n\nOn top of that it would take 3-5 business days to push the transaction through.\n\nAmazingly, the transaction was placed into my bank account today, just after the 24 hour hold. Someone must have expedited this after the system imposed hold was over.\n\nSo good result, but a lot of headache getting there.\n\nDec 7, 2022 - 11:30am\nCustomer service is the worst that I have encountered in years.\n\nI tried yesterday to log into my acccount and while I have 2FA on all my accounts, never got the SMS that Paypal sent.\n\nTried resetting my password and the poor technology then said we can't identify who you are. Tried to online chat with CS but you needed to login. So...\n\nThen came the nightmare with calling 'customer service'. Had to confirm my identity with the first agent which was ok. Then the handover to the second agent had me doing this again. And no information was sent so had to explain my issue all over again. Handover procedure...nil.\n\nTheir first step was to have me reset my password. I told them I just had. They said I did it wrong. I then asked for a manager.\n\nWhile they went to get their mananger (who has not replied yet), I jumped onto another operating system and browser. I then successfully logged in using Chrome on Android. I was then able to login to Paypal using Firefox on Linux, where I had issues before. The CS rep did not know Linux is an O/S.\n\nThe issue with Paypal sits with Chrome on Linux it seems but the CS folks decide to blame the customer first. Sub basement support.\n\nWhen they came back on the line they said the manager would get in touch on my home phone. They asked for it again and I gave it to them. CS then said it was not entered properly on my record. Little did they know that I had accessed my phone # on Paypal aready (since I had solved my own issue) and it was entered correctly. So lie from CS reps.\n\nAnd now the kicker...as I continue to sort out what happened (I plan to ditch this poor service), I installed the PayPal app on my mobile phone. And on that device while I am logged into PayPal on Chrome, the app says it cat't identify me. Security run amok with the poor technical expertise and woeful testing.\n\n1:13pm\nAnd the issues continue. I have received an email from PayPal stating that they are going to hold on to my funds for an additional 24 hours for 'security review.' This is on top of the 3-5 days that is per normal. This now makes 48 hours that I will not have access to my funds due to technical reasons and now 'security'. Especially silly when they have confirmed my identity verbally, twice.\n\nPassive agressive, uninformed, unempathic, dishonest.", 'review_date': '2022-12-08', 'review_time': '04:04:34', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
