Absolutely one of the worst companies out there. Firstly they have closed my account due to ‘suspicious activity’ and ‘raffles’. I was raising money for charity from friends and family (people I actually know) and they are claiming that this is not the case and I have been illegally making my money. Secondly they also did this to my business account which has now been sorted but again for the same reason. I showed them my webpage and nothing was suspicious looking so they have re opened it. Now the money I was going to donate to charity can long longer be donated because I am unable to access the money until after 180 days apparently. Money that wasn’t illegally made. They were donations towards a fundraiser I did. They have no proof or even any facts that I have done anything wrong yet they are still keeping my account closed. They have done this to many other people in the past and it seems as though they are bored in this pandemic and lockdown that they have nothing better to do than to mess around with peoples accounts. I just can’t express how angry and upset I am. DO NOT USE PAYPAL. THEY WILL CLOSE YOUR ACCOUNT FOR NO REASON AT ALL.

After I refused and requested a complete refund, they offered me a 20% return as it would cost me to much to send the items back to China. The items were supposedly shipped out of California. I then went to PayPal and opened a claim and got nowhere. They just responded that I needed to return the items (which I didn't even order) to the seller. Thats when I realized paypal is also a scam.
