I set up a Paypal Business account as an additional way for my clients to transfer me payment. Since I have clients all over the world, I thought Paypal would be a good option. Almost immediately, I ran into issues. With a couple days of setting up my account and receiving my first payment, Paypal permanently limited my account with zero warning, zero explanation, and zero recourse for correction.\n\nThey have been holding my client\'s payment for over 2 months now, and their customer service is, without exaggeration, the worst I\'ve ever experienced. I have sent multiple emails trying to refund, transfer or release my client\'s funds (either back to them or to me) and get the same automated response that "Paypal reserves the right to limit accounts for any reason, without explanation." No other comments on the error messages I get when attempting to transfer the money - no help at all.\n\nAbsolutely unacceptable.\n\nI will never use Paypal again, privately or for business.\n\nAnyone reading this, I advise you to use other forms of payment, like Zelle, Stripe or old school bank-to-bank wire transfer (standard here in the EU still). For international clients, I can\'t recommend Wise enough. Of course, Paypal\'s Trust Pilot score is 1.2 stars, and Wise is 4+. I should have checked before...\n\nAvoid Paypal at all costs.
