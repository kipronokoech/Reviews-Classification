I then requested a refund from the seller (Patrick Hanley), who agreed to downgrade my perpetual license to a one-year license and give me a partial refund of around $2500 (yes, one-year license costs around $3500), but he kept saying that he doesn\'t have the money in his account to give me the partial refund and that he is uncertain of the exact date when he would be able to make a payment. And I was getting quite frustrated of the wait and his reluctance to give a definite date for refund. At this point, it seemed sensible to raise a dispute with Paypal in order to request a refund from the seller. So I rang PayPal and I informed the staff that the software wasn\'t performing well and it kept crashing my laptop when I used the software. The PayPal staff who recorded my complaints translated it wrongly and stated that my reason to raise a dispute was because the software (Stallion 3D) physically damaged my PC. The seller defended my wrongly-recorded complaint by stating that his software has never really physically damaged anybody\'s PC. A few emails, calls and days later, PayPal informed me that they are unable to make a decision in my favour (note: their "buyers protection" is nonsense imho). Since then, I have been trying to contact the seller, but he has been ignoring my emails, and no trace of even the previously agreed "partial refund" (for which I have his email as evidence and PayPal has already been forwarded a copy of the email thread between myself and the seller). Now, I\'m seriously considering going to the press and take legal actions to get some form of justice/compensation but I have no idea on where to start.\n\nBottom line: They really don\'t give a damn about us!', 'review_date': '2018-01-03', 'review_time': '03:51:05', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
