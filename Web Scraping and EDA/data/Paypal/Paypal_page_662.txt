(It was a family channel, nothing outrageous or anything). By the looks of it someone had it in for them and kept getting them blocked where ever they tried to establish themselves anew, wheter on youtube or vimeo or whereever..\n\nI saw their plead on instagram, and decided to show my support by making a donation. Almost immediately after that I got an email from PayPal saying that my PayPal account had been "limited", which effectively meant I couldn\'t use it anymore.\n\nThe (automated, I must assume) "explanation" given was that upon lookthrough they could see that I had supposedly been using my account contrary to their tos.. - which is absolute bs because the only thing I was using my account for was eBay purchases and occasional donations to misc charity or developers of freeware apps that had been useful, and such..\n\nDespite the email had suggested I could contact their support in case I believed there was a mistake, that turned out to be impossible, as any attempt on my part to navigate to their support page just returned me to the page saying my account had been "limited".\n\nBut bottomline is that by the looks of it some internet big-shots got it in for that former youtuber and was effectively having all the big service providers block them. And PayPal was evidently going along with this bullying-round of big isp\'s against a little guy, and not only that but was evidently furthermore TAKING IT SO FAR AS TO EXPAND THEIR HARASSMENT TO ANYONE WHO HAD EVEN SHOWN SUPPORT for the unfortunate target.\n\nI consider this TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE BEHAVIOUR from PayPal!!\n\nJust because they\'re big they shouldn\'t be allowed to go along with a withchhunt; ganging up on some random small family and even expanding the harassment to anyone who as much as show support for their target!\n\nThe email from them did between the lines suggest the possibility that I could in principle make a new account using a different email address and a different credit card.. (Yes it wasn\'t that they weren\'t happy about my doing my business throug their service) ..\n\nBut guess what, PayPal: There is no way in hell that I would even dream of using PayPal EVER again!\n\nAnd furthermore, since you\'re so keen on expanding your harassment even to those who show support for the victim of your random bullying, here\'s what:\n\nI WILL NOT EVEN DO BUSINESS WITH SELLERS WHO HAVE PAYPAL AS AN OPTION!!\n(Sry abt that eBay, but from now on I prefer to do business on amazon and aliexpress in stead..

They rule in favor of sellers and could really care less if you are supported. On Nov 11 I purchased from an online company called Hyping. The purchase was for $111.70 for 3 items. After a month of no communication and no item I reached out to the company. I finally received a tracking number and received my delivery on 12/22. When I opened the package there were only 2 of the 3 items I purchased. Upon further investigation of the items 1 of the 2 items was supposed to be a mens XXL and at best it was a Childs large. There was no way it was usable. When I logged on to Paypal to dispute the charge I noticed the transaction was for $119.70 not $111.70 as I agreed to. So at this point I am out $83.80 and Paypal sent me a request for a "police report" to resolve this issue. I have spoken to 2 representatives from PayPal and they still ruled in the sellers favor because I could not provide a police report. This is the most insane I have ever seen and now I have to dispute this charge with my bank. Paypal doesn\'t care about any buyer only making $$$. Its a shame that things are this way.
