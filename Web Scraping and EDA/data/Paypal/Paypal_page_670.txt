Instead they sided with a scammer over a loyal customer after calling THREE times and speaking with different agents. The worst part is that people are STILL being scammed and Paypal is refusing to refund or stand by their buyer protection policy. I will only use my CC for now on since they did end up issuing the refund after PP denied it twice.
