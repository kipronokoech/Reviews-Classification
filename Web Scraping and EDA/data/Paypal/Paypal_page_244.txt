Because I've had no issue, I've never had cause to interact with their customer services until now. Having just come off the phone, I can confirm that it's mind blowingly bad! So, firstly, I was only on the phone because six messages over two days between myself and the 'help chat' on the app got me nowhere. The replies are obviously from real people for whom English is a second language. Whilst very polite, it's as if they are run through a translation app and the result is very disjointed sentence structure along with a few odd turns of phrase. Anyway, whoever I was speaking to didn't seem to fully understand the problem (an unlinked bank account) and initially said I would need to contact my bank (I was pretty sure this wasn't the case but I did that and the bank were as confused as me) then said I would need to phone in.\nFirst phone call lasted 41 minutes. I was on hold for about two thirds of that time whilst the guy I was speaking to 'investigated that for me'. I don't think my query was particularly complicated but it seemed to involve lots of long holds to check things and then the advisor would come back and say/ask something that we'd already covered or say something completely irrelevant to the issue. I assumed I'd just been unlucky and been connected to the company idiot so, three minutes in to the seventh occasion of being on hold, I gave up, hung up and called back in.\nSecond call I got through to some one who seemed a bit more on the ball but who put me on hold again almost immediately without warning. Then, after some further talking and a couple of holds 'to investigate that for me' (must be a standard line they're told to use every time they look something up) she never came back! Waited 15 mins (the crap hold music is still in my head!) and gave up again.\nSo, I still haven't solved the issue...", 'review_date': '2021-12-14', 'review_time': '15:28:02', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
