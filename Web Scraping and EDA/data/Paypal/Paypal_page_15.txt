This is utterly ludicrous and borderline criminal, at the very least incompetent and dodgy af.\n\nIt basically means that the vendor could if they so wished change their mind about some aspect of the purchase and decide to charge you extra, or even put you on a recurring payment without your knowledge.\n\nPayPal in their infinte stupidity also lumps these vendor approvals in with true recurring payment authorities (eg for a subscription service). There is literally no way to discern which of the active authorities is a subscription and which isn\'t. It\'s an absolute joke.\n\nPayPal also hides the link to their Resolution Centre, obviously on purpose. You literally have to go to the help section to find the link. What nonsense! They are telling us that really they don\'t care about your issues, just go away and be happy with whatever tomfoolery is going on.\n\nSame goes for the so called "Support" service... its pathetic. Don\'t bother leaving a question on the chat, they never repsond. And make sure you\'ve got a good hour or so if you want to call them. How does such a massive multi-billion dollar company handling such an important matter as money get away with this medocrity?\n\nThe stories of blocking accounts, holding funds, providing no proper explanation for actions taken, acting in such a callous and unfair manner, are unreal.
