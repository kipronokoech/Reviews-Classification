Since it was guest checkout, there is not evidence of the charge on her personal account, but luckily she has emails FROM PAYPAL in her email. She tells Customer Service and they open a dispute. They say they will only communicate through these messages on the Resolution Center and not through PayPal because it was a guest checkout. My mother provides proof of the purchase through screenshots and emails. Well, lo and behold, service@paypal sends an email requesting more documents and says NOT to send them through email, and only through the open case in her profile. How is my mother supposed to do this when THERE IS NO CASE IN HER PROFILE? Paypal was aware of this.
