As has been said very poor investigation in fact to me there was none or could I say a scam. Made to feel like a criminal by both companies. BEWARE PayPal are leaving Britain this year and using another named Norwegian company called Zettel to run the name behind the scenes I wonder why as I see so many accounts not getting dealt with. I was cut off totally no phone contact nothing. I am discussed by the company attitude never had any problems with them till eBay. I do not recommend dealing with them as it’s looks like everyone is getting treated in the same manner. I never had a limitation on my account till I needed to get help. These companies just do what they like when they like bad business.

Paypal is a company that is run by a mafia, they will charge you as much as possible then freeze your money/your account to "protect themselves and their customers" whatever that means even when there is ABSOLUTELY NOTHING wrong with what you are doing, even when your customers absolutely LOVE YOU. They are just too big and too stupid to be a good company anymore. One day, we will hear about their downfall. For now, they still enjoy some kind of market "monopoly", but just like the old banking system is falling in profit of fintechs, crypto and other 2.0 banking systems, Paypal will fall prey to newcomers that bring back humanity and good practices to this sector. By the way, the APP/Website are super buggy, the support is mediocre. They really just live on their customer base, but that will definitely change.\nIf you had the same experience with this "thing called a company", do not hesitate to warn others on other review platforms like GetApp, G2 and Capterra.', 'review_date': '2023-06-27', 'review_time': '09:01:52', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
