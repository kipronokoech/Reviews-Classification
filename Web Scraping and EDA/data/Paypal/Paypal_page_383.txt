It was a Chinese business trying to sell products as a US company with wrong delivery time. After after a month, it was not delivered, and Paypal would not let me cancel it. After about 45 days, it was delivered, and Paypal closed my case. Meanwhile, I got a new charger from a US based company.

If they state the PP reference number did not exist, they still managed to make a decision, refund the buyer, no appeal and conclusively the money forcibly debited from my account.\n\nTo add insult to injury, the money PayPal demanded would be taken from my personal bank account and an administration charge of £14 lodged and that was for following the UK law on consumer returns!\n\nI followed the UK law on returns and PAYPAL feel they are above the law.
