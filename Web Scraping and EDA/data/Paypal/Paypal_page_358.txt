{'platform': 'Paypal', 'id': '60682e50f85d75087045c17f', 'stars': 1, 'title': 'This matter concerns Paypal and relates…', 'message': 'This matter concerns Paypal and relates to the transitional period. It’s a slightly changed version of previous posts and will no doubt change again when the matter has been discussed with the specialists with knowledge of UK banking regulations. It’s the bases of a complaint to the FCA.\nPaypal repeatedly change their operating procedures and you only find out when you come to utilise their services when as in my case errors occur. I have dealt with Paypal for some twenty years and I act with complete integrity towards them. I doubt whether in those twenty years they would be able to point to a single problem with the functioning of my account but their staff invariably either through lack of training or total indifference treat clients with complete indifference and their procedures are written on the assumption that every client is a criminal.\n\nThe first issue relates to the transition period regarding our leaving the EU. Paypal operate on the assumption that matters relating to their services should be handled by the Luxembourg regulator. That can only be an attempt to thwart any complaint as it works on the assumption that ever one of their UK clients is fully aware of our leaving the EU and a change in regulation except Paypal staff.\nThe second matter concerns changes in their procedures. I made an error and perhaps the only error in twenty years in using their services and transferred my complete balance back to my UK bank. I needed to transfer some money back and their appropriate web page displayed the message ‘due to a technical issue we cannot do this please try again later’. I then throughout the day tried repeatedly to do this before I phoned them and the person I spoke to had no knowledge of this until he consulted somebody and told me their had been a change in procedure which did not allow them to do this. To try and overcome the problem I asked to speak to the person who had provided that information to them but was told that ‘they were not at this time not taking calls’. Which in Paypal speak is ‘xxx off’. Unless they can provide a reasonably competent functioning call centre that should be taken into account in the decision over the type of licence they are given to operate in the UK.\nThe next matter concerns escrow accounts and Paypal’s functioning as a money lender. At some stage presumably to try to by-pass the need to keep money separate which has been paid for goods purchased they have changed the procedures to say that payments made are not being made to accounts held for sellers they are made to Paypal. This effectively gives Paypal the right to treat all Payments made as their money which of itself cannot be correct. What it means is that this matter could merely be used by anybody operating as a payment processor and banking regulations could be completely bypassed. They are not holding the money for clients they have the money and can write their rules in whatever way they like and act with complete impunity when they decide to make or not make payments to clients. You can see how they operate this system by viewing its operation on Trustpilot.\nThen you have the matter of their moving into the loan business. People are offered loans without any explanation of who the regulator and the legal jurisdiction under which the loans are offered. Effectively this means that because there is no need to operate escrow accounts by dint of the changes in their rules they can lend money to people who are phoned up and cold called who are offered loans using the money which they are effectively holding for clients. The phone calls may be a scan but because of the manner their call centres treat people there is no effective way of finding out. It’s in ‘normal’ banking terms not their money but if they claim they are not operating as a bank legislation relating to banking does not apply. And finally given that they say they will transfer the money back into my account it will take the better part of 14 working days which with Easter and weekends that would add at least six days and amount to twenty days for an electronic transfer so somebody is having the benefit of huge sums of money.', 'review_date': '2021-04-03', 'review_time': '08:58:56', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
