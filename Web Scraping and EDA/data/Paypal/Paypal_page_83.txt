I opened a PayPal account to receive my direct deposits. WORST MISTAKE EVER! I have a really hard time remembering things and so if I can't remember a password I'll just make up a new account (very bad habit I know). I set up the account had a couple thousand dollars deposited spent my money as I needed to. Then I was robbed my purse was stolen my phone was in it. So I lost everything, and eventually my home, my job, my vehicle. I had no ID no documents to prove who I was, no family or friends to speak of my best friend and advisor my mother had just past and I was a mess over that fact alone. I didn't know how to go about trying to reclaim my life or even if I wanted to. I didn't even know how I was going to find a place to sleep ( motel's don't allow you to get a room without Identification) or eat much less shower and dress for work everyday. I had money in my Paypal account I knew because that's where my direct deposits were being sent. I no longer had the debit card as it was in my wallet (stolen). I couldn't remember the email address I had used when I opened the account and shortly before opening the account I had purchased a new phone,with a brand new PHONE NUMBER So now I can't even access much less find my Paypal account. I was so consumed with my survival needs that I simply couldn't be bothered with trying to get Paypal to help me find my account. By the time I put my deposits on hold I had received 7,004.97 in additional deposits. So now I'm homeless, scared, clueless and broken. I figure out how to get my documents together and reclaim my life or at least my identity. I got another job still struggling to secure affordable permanent housing. IM GETTING BY BARELY. So the only way I see to move to more affordable housing and get a vehicle and be able to save money in case of tragically unforseen life altering catastrophes, is to find the PayPal account. So my hunt begins. It is a never ending, exhausting and extremely frustrating journey. PayPal is useless as useless could be. In assisting me. They claimed they couldn't look up the account with my social security number, my name or any other information I had to give. Only the email address or phone number. So I became a detective. I found the Facebook account I had when I opened the account and saw witch picture I was using at that time. I searched the PayPal app and Google daily trying to understand as much about them as I could. Then one day I put in the right/wrong way to spell my name Bingo so I had the cash tag. Paypal continued to say they couldn't help me or use there own issuing tag to find my account. I contiued to search eventually paying for the trial service of speoko witch pulled up every phone number and email address I've ever had. I received help from a very limited few at Paypal like 3 people to be EXCAT they allowed me to send lists of possible email addresses and they would run a check on them to find out if any of them had my deposits. So the day I found my account I WAS BEYOND ECSTATIC I WAS SO HAPPY SO EXCITED. 2 YRS from last dep. Little did I know my nightmare had only began. I can now SEE THE THOUSANDS SITTING THERE STARING BK AT ME AND CANT USE THEM. Needing things like rent money on short weeks and the fear of being told to leave again with that money sitting there is another level of FRUSTRATION ITS INFURIATING. So I start the updates witch I knew nothing about. Or PayPal's rules or security. I was trusting that were telling me the correct procedures. They're paypal, A mutibillion dollar company.The customer service people are very unprofessional. They're RUDE, HAVEN'T A CLUE WHAT IS GOING ON, they've HUNG UP ON ME MULTIPLE TIMES, HAVEN'T ANY COMMUNICATION SKILLS WITH EACH OTHER, AND REFUSE TO LISTEN THAT I MIGHT KNOW WHAT IM SPEAKING ON. So after every single update starting with my email. It's Wait 48 hrs can't access account. It's my fault to many changes an attempts now it's my name I try to get them to let me send documents to prove I'm me they don't need them. Baffling wait 48 hrs. Phone number update 72 hrs. I'm able to add my cards. Can't transfer my money or request a check. But it's Progressing now needs to be verified. Waiting again. I'm able to send 0.01 to someone. Now everything needed to be confirmed.They did these confirmations one at a time. I've only been able to transfer 704.97 and now the account is blocked again. Another 4 to 5 days is what I'm told. I still can't log in on the website. Only in the app. I feel they are playing with me TORTURING ME. IM TIRED OF THE GAMES. I NEED A LAWYER AT THIS POINT! ITS BEEN NOTHING BUT ISSUES AND LIES. SO if life happens YOU CANT COUNT ON PAYPAL. THEY REFUSE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THERE RESPONSIBILITY AS BUSINESS OWNERS TO HELP THEIR CUSTOMERS FORGET ABOUT CUSTOMERS BEING RIGHT OR HAPPY!
