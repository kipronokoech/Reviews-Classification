The mobility restrictions issued by some states in the US market have forced consumers to go to the internet to purchase basic goods online.\n\nThe complaints claim that the PayPal logo and payment system are consistently used in fraudulent websites because the San Jose-based company has not implemented any measures to vet sellers or websites, and often sides with the fraudulent sellers when denying disputes.\n\nPayPal offered users a purchase insurance that protected them from fraudulent purchases. However, the complaints against PayPal claim that PayPal's insurance places on the buyer the burden of proofing that the seller webpage is fraudulent. The protection that many PayPal users expect when using PayPal to complete transactions online is in fact non-existent when the users are burden with the impossible task of documenting proof of fraud, complaints claim.", 'review_date': '2020-10-12', 'review_time': '17:41:53', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
