Second, why did Paypal allow the transfer of funds to the account? Last but not least, why is it they will not release my funds to me?\nRhetorical question...\nThe representative I spoke with this morning, told me funds are not reversible once sent. Followed by, she spoke to her supervisor who said, my son needs to call Paypal to confirm what I am saying and Paypal will ATTEMPT to find a way to reverse the funds.\nThe same minor son with whom Paypal spoke to yesterday, with whom they cannot do business, the same minor son whose contract is unenforceable??? Although, Paypal acknowledges seeing the transfer from my account to his, the money can neither be utilized by my son, nor reversed back to me because he is 17.
