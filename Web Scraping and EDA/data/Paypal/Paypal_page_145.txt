I noticed this - not by an alert from paypal, but by finding I had about 200+ junk emails in my gmail account. I learned this is an approach hackers use - bomb your email with junk email so you do not see the emails about the fraudulent transactions occuring. I immediately checked my bank accounts, and saw multiple transfers from my paypal linked bank account. I reported this immediately to paypal. I asked them to freeze my account. They failed to do this, and additional fraudulent transfers were made. I called again, they said they submitted the case to the resolution center on my behalf. I then received an email indicating all the transactions were "deemed non-fraudulent".\n\n9 months later, I have FINALLY, after tens of emails, and countless hours on the phone with incompetent, and under-empowered staff, been compensated for the nearly $6,000 USD which they allowed to be transferred out of my account to an unknown, unidentifiable wells fargo bank account.\n\nI have since closed my account, and will never use paypal again.\n\nAdvice - use an alternative... ANY alternative. Not worth the risk.', 'review_date': '2022-10-25', 'review_time': '02:40:32', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
