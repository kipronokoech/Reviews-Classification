I told him that it got hacked and I just wanted to close it. Another agent responded telling me how to close my account. Well if they had read the previous conversation like they are supposed to, they would know I tried that already. So I messaged them saying that it keeps telling me I have an open disputes even though the other agent told me that I do not.

I mean it could not be any worse, it's like the computer geeks who setup the system decided to make it as complicated as possible.
