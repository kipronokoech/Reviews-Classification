I reopened the case but they favoured the dodgy seller instead. you will not be safe ever with paypal at all. they won't do anything to help you. they asked me to return an item so that I can get my refund for my hard earned money.

I again contacted them several times and after a month hasn't received the address in English. when I rang them, they said the case is closed because it is passed how many days that I did not send them the tracking# of the item returned.

To pay for it, I could chose using Paypal or credit card. Due to previous bad experiences with Paypal, I chose credit card. But after having filled all the details (without any error) for the card, PAYPAL said online, that the card could not be used.\n\nSince I wanted the item, I was then forced to use my Paypal account.\n\nA few days later, I got a track and trace number, but it didn\'t work. The next day the company mailed me, that they did not have the item, but I could buy a model with severely worse specs. I said no, and asked my money back. The company said OK, but I have not received anything yet. Today is 12.06.2019.\n\nI contacted Paypal to get my money back, and got two mails back. The first one stating they had transfered the amount from my bank account to my Paypal account. WHAT?\n\nSo now I have paid for this non-existing device twice!\n\n8 hours later I got an email from Paypal stating that they have accepted my request for a refund and that the money will show up on my bank account in about 30 days. WHAT?\nIf the buy was made using a credit card, that card would be used for the refund. The mail also stated that the case was now closed.\n\nSince I was not happy being debited twice for a non-existing product, I tried to answer Paypals email. But of course you cannot, and that is also stated in the smallprint at the end of the mail.\n\nI then clicked on the link in the email stating you could get help and contact. It took me about 10 minutes to navigate through their stupid "Help" system the purpose of which seem to be to avoid getting any message back from their customers.\n\nFinally I found a place where I could write something, so I found the mail that was not being delivered to Paypal, and pasted it into the problem description box. This more or less mad my computer useless, the CPU running 100%. After a while, I found out that you can only input so few characters in this box, that you cannot describe anything sensible there.\n\nBut Oh, I could attach files to the complaint, lucky me. So I created a word document where I once again pasted the text from the mail into.\n\nIn the meantime I got a message in the browser that quite rudly asked me if I had anything more to say, or should they close the session?\n\nThe document was ready to be attached, but of course this would be too easy for Paypal\'s customers: Only image files can be attached.\n\nOK. I then opened the document and took screenshots of it, 6 in all.\n\nThen it was a fairly easy task to just attach these 6 files to the complaint. But no, only 5 files are allowed to be attached. And again my computer\'s CPU was running like crazy.\n\nI had to delete the 6th file in order to get to the send button and I clicked it. Nothing happened. Tried everything I could think of to get this message send, nothing worked.\n\nI had to open a new browser window pasting in the URL from the original complaint window, and then cutting and pasting all the stuff from the old window into the new one. In the new window the send button worked.\n\nSomehow I have the feeling that Paypal thinks that the way to get few complaints from their users is to make the complaint system a nightmare.\n\nStay away from this company.\n\nI have once before closed a Paypal account, and I definately will again.\n\nAnd for you shop owners out there, If I can only buy your stuff having Paypal involved, you won\'t sell anything to me.', 'review_date': '2019-06-12', 'review_time': '22:39:44', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
