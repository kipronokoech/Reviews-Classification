I returned it the day after receiving it on 31st March using the returns label attached to the email dated 31st March 2020 (12.54 pm) sent by Music Magpie (he has the copy of both email and returns label). I obtained a Royal Mail receipt at the post office with the tracking number XF212423333GB (PLEASE FEEL FREE TO CHECK THE TRACKING YOURSELVES). The returns label also has this tracking number on it. I checked on Royal Mail's website and saw that the phone was delivered successfully on 1st April at 3.16pm.\nAfter a few days and hearing nothing I contacted Music Magpie to chase up my refund and was told that they would look into it and get back to him. I heard nothing and contacted them several more times with the same response.\n\nI contacted PayPay for advice as I had used them as the method at checkout for processing my credit card payment. They advised to raise a dispute which I did. I provided them with the tracking, copy of the Royal Mail website tracking showing delivery and also transcript with Music Magpie advising that they would refund me but only if I dropped the dispute. I contacted Paypal to ask if I should drop the dispute in order to get my refund. They told me not to as it would give me no comeback at all. After a few days I was shocked to see that Paypal had gone in the favour of Music Magpie. I rang PayPal again as it looked like no-one there had actually looked at the documents I had provided. I have raised an appeal with Paypal but also contacted my credit card company to raise a dispute. I have subsequently provided Paypal with a copy of Music Magpies email on 31 March which has their returns label attached and also provided Paypal with a copy of this returns label showing the matching tracking number to the Royal Mail post office receipt and online RM tracking.\n\nI am now waiting for Paypal to finalise the appeal although I will obviously take it up with my credit card company also.\n\nI used Paypal many times but have now lost all confidence in their ability to provide fair protection for a buyer despite evidence that the buyer had done all the necessary steps correctly.\n\nIt is now nearly 7 weeks since Music Magpie received the phone back and still no refund has been issued. The process of trying to get a refund has been exhausting and is causing a lot of stress and worry.\n\nWhat more can I do other than:\n\nPrint off the returns label provided by Music Magpie\n\nPackage the phone and take it to the post office and get a receipt\n\nTrack the package on Royal Mail website to ensure it was delivered successfully.\n\nAll of this has been done - Music Magpie now have both the phone which they can resell and my £559.99 which is a lot of money and I have been totally let down by PayPal who do not appear to have taken any effort in looking at the documents provided by me. If they had, I would have my refund by now.", 'review_date': '2020-05-17', 'review_time': '14:05:07', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

Fear of seller not sending or buyer being not happy and seller not offering a solution. But this can be dealt with in other ways in future. Nobody needs Paypal, the trade with fear. People will find ways to trust by making a phone call before paying, etc.\nThe service Paypal doesn\'t offer is extraordinary. Before one clicks through a jungle of FAQ-walls one finally reaches to the message form.

Waiting since days for payment being not on hold anymore, after the tracked parcel has been already been reportedly received and buyer left a positive feedback on the auction platform.\nAlso, consider Paypal was founded by someone who is in my eyes illegaly shooting satellites for 5g in the sky, astronomers protest already because the circa 10-20.000 satellites will interfere a lot with sky watching.

The same is true for mobile phones that are smartypants phones - tracking data, becoming surveillance tools that are more and more used to control and track and spy on people of nations (there are reportedly apps that allow that your microphone data is recorded all the time and transferred to the app, because it\'s declared as only listening to tv ads in the background - but who can make sure it\'s only listening to that and not making errors and listening to humans around the phone).
