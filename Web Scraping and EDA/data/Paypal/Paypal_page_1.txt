You can find information about lifting your limits in your account profile". This made no sense, as the item was less than $20, and he\'s bought things much more expensive than that using PP.\n\nSo, I tried the Twitter PayPal support. The reply to my first DM didn\'t exactly fill me with confidence, "Hello, I’m the PayPal Assistant. I’m still learning. Here are some useful links to view frequently asked questions..." "I\'m still learning?" What? After replying with the info they\'d requested, it became clear that I was either corresponding with a bot or, if with a real human being, they weren\'t bothering to read my messages. The last message from them suggested we try to order something under ten dollars and see what happened! Might as well have suggested I cast the bones. Needless to say, I gave up.\n\nI hope this isn\'t a taste of things to come with PP generally. The screen-wash of one-star reviews on here doesn\'t really bode well.
