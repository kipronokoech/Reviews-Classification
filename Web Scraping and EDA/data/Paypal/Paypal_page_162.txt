We've taken the decision to pull the plug and remove Paypal from our website.\nWe bust our balls to give good customer service. We ship all orders promptly and in most cases everything runs smoothly. Very occasionally Royal Mail deliveries are delayed or even lost. It's a fact of life and nothing we can do about it. Because most of our deliveries are free (to the customer), we don't use a tracked method so we need to allow Royal Mail up to 10 working days for delivery. This is what Royal Mail allows before an items is considered lost. If the item is not delivered within 10 working days, we'll issue a full refund or reship, depending on the customers wishes.\n\nUnfortunately thought, despite all this information being in our terms and conditions and despite the fact that UK Consumer law allows up to 30 days for delivery, Paypal allow customers to raise a dispute at any time after the order is placed and actively encourage customers to escalate it to a claim. Why would they do this you ask. Well it's because Paypal now charge Â£12.50 for every claim made against a merchant.\n\nWhat this means is that a customer can raise a dispute just a couple of days after placing an order, immediately escalate that to a claim without any time allowed for us to respond and try to resolve the issue and even if we issue an immediate refund we will be charged Â£12.50. You just can't win. Paypal are extorting money from UK merchants and it's no wonder that they have removed themselves from the Financial Ombudsman Services Voluntary Jurisdiction. I guess they don't like being charged when customers complain about them.\n\nI guess Paypal are desperate to claw back the money they are loosing when eBay ditched them.\n\nTo all merchants out there. Get rid of Paypal. They are no longer relevant in 2022. It's easy to get a proper merchant account and payment provider and I can assure you that customers that want to buy your goods will not leave just because you don't accept Paypal.\n\nAs a customer these days, I rarely use Paypal (even if a merchant offers it).
