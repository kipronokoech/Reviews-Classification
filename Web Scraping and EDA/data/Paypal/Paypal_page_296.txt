Paypal after stating that yes I am under purchase protection, yes thhey would get me a refund, and yes that they understood the account used was hacked they still decided to rule against me.\n\nSo now not only did I not get a refund for the multiple transactions done on my account. G2G only cared about quickly delivering the items to the hacker just so they can have the excuse of the items being delivered already to provide as evidence to paypal. On top of not only contacting both paypal and G2G immediately on the day it occurred to dispute/cancel the payments neither party helped me in stopping it and allowed me to lose the money spent on goods not even directed to me. On top of this same even someone else had sent money into my paypal account to spend on G2G and then refunded it via "Unauthorized Transaction" more than likely from another hacked account.\n\nOne rep told me just use invoices if I am selling stuff, another told me contact the person to refund you or send you the money again (this never works by the way cause they will ignore paying you) cause they already won the case. Third rep in fact tried to limit my account and not the other party which makes no sense at all. Fourth actually told me they got the refund through their bank when it stated it\'s Paypal Balance and another rep right after didn\'t tell me the same thing at all they stated that it\'s cause they have a different IP which honestly cause of how tech is today they can just VPN or have someone else use their login to pay for things (not even paypal would be able to actually know if these people did so or not).\n\nAs of current G2G still uses paypal to do their business the hacker still has possession of my account on G2G they received the goods from them and I am almost -$500 less on paypal because they only give sugar coated platitudes of "sorry I cannot help you" after siding against you. After getting a hold of probably my sixth or seventh rep I asked them so not only did your site not have any place to provide evidence you also never gave me an option to counter anything the other party gave you. Even after they gotten all the screenshots, transaction numbers, any other additional information and repeating myself again that my G2G account is not in my possession cause of the hacker (they managed to change all my login info and there was no link to stop them). Instead they continued to tell me things akin to yeah we are on your side when they really are not.\n\nBefore anyone comment and say why didn\'t you escalate I will tell you I have tried multiple times from twitter, facebook, on my own account, I emailed them, I tried to reopen my case, all of these and where did it get me the answer is nowhere. I even called more than one branch of paypal and I did it for almost an entire week straight. It wasn\'t until the second to last call I called they told me "sorry once they other party provided proof of delivery you would lose the case even if you escalate it." Guess what I decided to do I told them escalate it anyways, guess what didn\'t happen they didn\'t escalate it. So I called in again got another rep they instead said "You cannot win the case even when escalated and I do not want you to keep having to call back for something you can\'t fix so would you please stop calling." If that isn\'t enough to tell me that everything I did was in vain I don\'t know what would. Now I have around 7 disputes all closed in the favor of the other party when I am the one being scammed and all I can do is grieve over my losses and trying to find a way to cover the cost of everything.', 'review_date': '2021-08-06', 'review_time': '13:27:03', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
