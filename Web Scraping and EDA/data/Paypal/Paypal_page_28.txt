The manager there tried to be helpful but, this wasn't his job. He just said that the call center should have known the answer. So, I decided to tell my customers that I can't accept Paypal.

I used PayPal Credit account to pay for this purchase which was meant to be delivered In 3 working days. On the 10th August I got my first message from the courier UPS to say my item would be delivered today between 10.15 and 2.15. No item ever arrived and I have received the same message daily now for the past 15 days. I have contacted the seller who is not interested and blames the courier UPS. UPS stated that customs have the item and it is out of their control and to contact the seller. Paypal refuse to refund my purchase price paid for using PayPal credit facility, stating that as the item is coming from abroad I have to wait 20 days even though I believed I was purchasing from a UK website and my invoice clearly states webshop United Kingdom, PayPal also tell me that each time the seller updates the tracking information this 20 day period is reset back to day zero, it has been updated with a different delivery day every day now for the past 15 days. This situation could just go on and on and on, all the seller has to do is keep updating the tracking information and PayPal tested the clock back to zero again. I have no item, a balance if £158.99 on my PayPal credit account which PayPal tell me I must pay even if I never receive the item. I believe this to be fraudulent conduct. My consumer rights under the sale of goods act 2015, the UK distance selling regulations etc are being completely ignored by both PayPal and the seller.under UK distance selling regulations I am entitled to cancel the order in the first 14 days without having to give any reason, and obtain a full refund, mindful of this 14 day period I emailed photospecialist on day 12 requesting the order to be cancelled under the 14 day distance selling regulations. I have had no response. Paypal serm to be condoning this sellers unacceptable behaviour.\nI do not believe I should have to pay a penny for items never received. Paypal tell me there is no buyer protection with PayPal credit even though it is advertised by PayPal as being 'just Like using a credit card without the physical card'. This being the case I should have cover under section 75 if the consumer credit act, but I am getting absolutely know here with PayPal. I asked to close the PayPal credit account as I believe it is a fraudulent facility being offered by PayPal, I was told no you can't as you have an outstanding balance in the account if £158.99 for the digital picture frame u have never received. I asked to close my PayPal account as I had never experienced conduct like this from PayPal in 29 years of being a member, I was told no you can't close your account as you have an outstanding balance in your account. I am being forced to pay for something I have not and may never receive. This just cannot be right at any level. Experience so far between 6th August and 22nd August.
