Granting him Free Vacation. I was shocked. He admitted staying, didn't oppose to all $4,250 but only to $500 Security Deposit he paid in Cash, separately from $4,250. He left apartment smelled marihuanna, excessively dirty, and burnt electrical bill astronomically high. We had Rental Agreement However awful Tenant disputed entire $4,250. For 3 weeks PayPal played ping pong games at me. Repeatedly reps promised dispute will be solved in my favor, as he should never dispute $4,250 having issue about $500. They promised to solve case 5-7 days, its still 3 weeks. Their manager Kevin, ID 1673207 told me he'd fulfill promise one rap gave me that I'll get my money 100%. Promised to listen to that conversation as theyre all recorded and call me back. He never did. On July 17, Martin, rep from Nebraska said Dispute resolution in favor of buyer was done in error, it should never be and he will reverse it in 10 min. 1hr later he called me saying He can't reverse it, special team has to review it 1st. I spoke then with his Manager, Derek. He guaranteed I will receive all $4,250, 150%, 48hrs from July 17, 10 am meaning mo later July 19, 10am and that he will monitor my account and call me back. Its been 24hrs later, I called dozens times getting agents from Philippines. No one had a clue who Derek was, they don't have ability too transfer to him or any agent we talk, no one found his notes either. I was furious, stressed. I kip calling all day hoping to get to US agent who might know Derek. I had no luck, but I got Kevin, manager. I asked him why he never called me back when he promised to, he said he didn't find that conversation on July 12 with rep who promised I'll get funds back.. Somehow he wasn't able to find any of my conversations, strange. What a lier. he didn't find conversation I had w/Derek and Martin. At the end he hung up on me. Awful. I called spoke to rep, Jose from Nebraska, he didn't know who Derek was and confirmed there was no notes. I could not believe. I went through such a horrific time. PayPal stole my money, giving Tenant free vacation. Its awful, evil, malicious. They should be sued and suspended for being thieves. I'm devastated. I despise PayPal. They're Morons, thieves. Why no one does anything to PayPal? Is there a way to escalate it too somewhere? They can't abuse customers, something must be done.

I had to resolve the issue on my own by refunding every transaction I had from my customers and for them to send back payments straight into my bank account because PayPal wasn’t linking it. I’ve called customer service for 5 straight days and no one was available. I’ve tried the message center but talking to a robot was no help. I’ve messaged PayPal on Facebook with a long and stressful message, only then was I able to speak to an actual person. If you’re reading this and are thinking of opening a PayPal account, I would suggest to try every possible way to link your debit cards, and bank accounts because that is the only way you will be able to get money out before PayPal steals it. Also, be sure that your phone number is able to receive SMS because without that, you will never be able to confirm it and confirming your phone number is a HUGE thing in the PayPal community. You must be SMART and because I first time using PayPal, I wasn’t fully educated. PayPal will give you the hardest time to receive any type of customer service, especially if you have a BIG AMOUNT OF MONEY in your PayPal balance. Reading hundreds to thousands of reviews, many people have this trouble and have had trouble for years and even up to this date they haven’t been solved. So really, there’s no resolution to anything unless you’re smart enough to help yourself. Now, I have a real person on PayPal Facebook trying to contact me to help me, after the fact that I found a way to take the money out of my account and wanting to close my account. Another note: they will do everything they can to have you not close it!
