The second one happened a day ago and was for a similar problem- placed an order on Amazon with a third party seller order came out to $10.27 it was a book and was supposed to be brand new but when I got it it was in horrible shape so I contacted the third party seller and had a similar experience as the first time seller refusing to help me so I submitted a claim to Paypal and was refunded. Btw I didn\'t pay with Paypal directly but with my Paypal Cash Card which is pretty much like a debit card and uses your Paypal balance).\n\nNow back to my review: I absolutely HATE Paypal with a burning passion. I went on my account today and noticed that I received an automated message from them saying that my account WAS FROZEN. And I have no idea why. Not only was my account frozen but so was EVERY SINGLE ACCOUNT associated with mine, every person i\'ve ever sent money to and every person who sent money to me all had their accounts frozen too (after seeing the message saying my account was frozen I did some research and found out that a lot of people who\'s accounts were frozen had accounts associated with theirs frozen too so I contacted my family and friends who I sent and recieved money from to check and sure enough they got the same account frozen message from Paypal). Sadly my mom who\'s been using eBay and Paypal for years now ever since they first came out account was frozen too. And the funny thing is my mom sent me $25.00 through Paypal FIVE years ago (which is why I made a Paypal in the first place) so our accounts haven\'t been connected in half a decade yet Paypal still froze hers and sadly that applies to most of the other accounts that were frozen- haven\'t been associated with mine in months to years. So there\'s absolutely NO logical reason for why they froze their accounts and my account but it isn\'t even surprising because while doing research I saw that there\'s probably been thousands of other people who had their accounts frozen for no reason too, even people like me who have been using Paypal for years, never caused any issues and are honest loyal users. Obviously it makes me mad because I did nothing wrong and Paypal couldn\'t even be bothered to tell me what I did "wrong" (the fact that they didn\'t just proves to me that there was no reason for it just like others they probably just randomly did it) but what bothers me the most is that my mom and my friends accounts have been frozen too because of it. I have a feeling that there\'s a lawsuit waiting to happen because in a sense this is discrimination. You randomly decide an account is "bad", freeze it without cause and then you freeze every single account associated with it and judge them as bad too just because it\'s associated with the account you see as bad...\n\nAlso I meant to say this earlier but if Paypal freezes your account you can no longer use it, can\'t remove cards or addresses, can\'t receive or send money and the worst part is they put a hold on your money for 180 days and you can\'t touch it, then after those 180 days (HALF AN EFFIN YEAR LATER) they\'ll "let you know" how you can get your money back (Oh and btw that\'s if they decide to even give it back to you and if by some miracle they do they won\'t give you that interest they earned on YOUR money either).... Thankfully I only have $5 and some change in my account so it\'s not a huge loss (look it up tho there\'s some people who had their accounts frozen with thousands of dollars) but this whole thing makes me mad and to be honest i\'m not sure if it\'s even worth the effort of trying to fight it because going by some other accounts from people who had this happen to them it was a nightmare trying to get their account unfrozen and 99.9% of the time Paypal wouldn\'t even unfreeze it.\n\nSTAY AWAY FROM PAYPAL! They\'re literal scum and act like they\'re gods- freezing accounts for no reason, taking OUR money, keeping OUR money and treating us badly.', 'review_date': '2020-08-22', 'review_time': '05:27:34', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

No, they can prove a delivery was made and PayPal doesn't care what was delivered, and more importantly what was not delivered. Amazing.
