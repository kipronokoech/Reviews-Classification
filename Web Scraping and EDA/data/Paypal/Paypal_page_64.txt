All they did was limit my account. For what reason? No explanation. 10 purchases made in Rubles (Russia\'s currency) all for some mushroom app. I don\'t know what it was but it was obviously a scam which I had since canceled. After explaining to paypal customer service very clearly they said, "We apologize we did not find anything suspicious on your account" Keep in mind that the Ukraine war was (and still is to this day) ongoing.
