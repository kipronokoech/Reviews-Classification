PayPal, even though we had told them time and time again that there was no glass in the items and could prove this still refund the buyer every time!

Using a credit card to purchase items from our own website we spend the same amount that we had just been defrauded for, we then withdrew the payments from the paypal account to our bank account, once this was complete we called our credit card company and initiated a charge-back for the credit card payments, the bank reversed the payments which then left the paypal account with a negative balance. We then received several pathetic letters from paypal and a mickey mouse debt company. Our reply to these letters were simple, please stop sending us these pathetic threatening letters and take legal action as we would like nothing more than to tear your company to pieces in a court of law at your own expense. We had copies of transcripts where we had warned them that the transactions were fraudulent but they still issued more refunds without the items being returned. Did they take action?
