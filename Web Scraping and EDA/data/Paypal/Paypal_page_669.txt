I have only needed to use the account for paying transactions for products purchased. 2 weeks ago I received $6200 from a vendor for services rendered which was verified and confirmed as being available in my account. On trying to transfer it to my bank it took 2 days to verify my account. Then I was told I couldn't transfer more than a $1000 per month!! I was then told that I needed to open a wallet and or PP plus and provide a social security number for verification purposes which I did. On the 6th or 7th customer call number which only allows contact with representatives out of either India or the Philippines I am told that my account needs to be refreshed which can only be done through a request supposedly escalated via 'the system' which would take at least 48 hrs. After 72 hrs I tried again and could not. The 7th call was similar to the 6th call. I was informed I could not speak to anybody in the USA as PayPal had outsourced the customer service aspect and there was nobody above the supervisor who not get in direct contact with anybody else only via a 48 hr request. I asked for a confirmation email but they were not allowed to send confirmation emails. I did get their name & ID #. So now I have to wait at least another 48 hours which will be getting onto 3 weeks with PayPal retaining my $6200 which who knows when I will be able to retrieve it. If I cannot transfer it in 48 hrs I will instruct them to refund the funds back to the vendor which apparently will take another 7-10 days & make alternate arrangements for the funds.", 'review_date': '2019-12-30', 'review_time': '03:50:02', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
