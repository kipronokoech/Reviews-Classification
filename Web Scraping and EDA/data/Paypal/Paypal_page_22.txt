However, this issue has taken a toll on my business, since I used my Stripe payouts to pay customers when Paypal funds were on hold, and even before I only used Paypal to pay for Facebook ads, because Paypal wouldn\'t allow me to link a bank account. Once I try to do so, and click on "link bank" it forwards me to the main dashboard. I\'ve reported this issue over a month ago, and they said it\'s a regional problem and they\'ll fix it soon from their end. However, it must be an intentional thing, because an american friend of mine has shown me that he\'s able to do so.\n\nPaypal also isn\'t allowing me to add a US debit card, because they limit the billing addresses you add to the country you opened your Paypal from.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUpdated Review 1 :\n\nReference ID: PP-L-426159964349\n\nAfter making several attempts to contact all the channels I have access to, be it through email or calling customer support.\n\nI received an email on Mon, Sep 11, 2023 at 6:26 PM from Paypal informing me that they restored some features, and that they\'ll proceed with restoring my full account after I provide some documents.\n\nAs I was uploading the documents and explaining my business, I received another email about an hour later, telling me that the 180 day hold is back again, and my account is fully deactivated, which is very disappointing considering that I\'ve done everything I can to abide by the Paypal policy.\n\nI\'m still on my word, that I\'ll do everything I can, and take all the necessary measures to retrieve what\'s rightfully owned. As I believe this is a matter of discrimination, because I belong to a country (Morocco) with a "high risk" in Paypal\'s views.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOriginal Review :\n\nReference ID: PP-L-426159964349\n\nPaypal unlawfully put a 180 day hold on the money I rightfully earned. I have a legitimate business model in place. I ship to customers in less than 2 days, and I upload the tracking number in less than 24 hours. I only have one single dispute where a client bought and cancelled on the same day claiming that they didn\'t receive their order. However, Paypal still put the infamous 180 day hold on my account and ignore all my attemps to contact customer support and their higher ups.\n\nI\'m only urging Paypal to do the right thing and review my case, as I truly believe, that I\'ve done everything by the book, and that my account is flawless as far as policy compliance is concerned.\n\nIn the event that Paypal reviews my case, I will update this review accordingly no matter the outcome.\n\nHowever, if that\'s not the case, I will leave no stone unturned, and i\'ll take all the legal channels to get my rightfully owned money.', 'review_date': '2023-09-20', 'review_time': '07:37:12', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

This means that MY MONEY is being held hostage by PayPal, so that PayPal can draw interest in their bank account! I messaged PayPal twice, trying to resolve the issue, but got no response. The next day, I called PayPal, and was shocked to find that my call was being taken by AI (Artificial Idiot)! After almost screaming at this Robot, that I wanted to speak to a Human, it finally asked if I would like to speak to a representative! Yes...I screamed! After holding for a bit, another Robot answered the phone! This Robot finally asked if I would like for a representative to call me back within 30-45 minutes. Finally I get a call back from another Robot, that asked me to state my name. Back on hold I go! After a bit, an actual person came on line, and could only recite to me, what was listed in the PayPal general articles. I said that if she could not actually help me, I wanted to speak to a supervisor. After a while, a supervisor came on line, with an accent that very difficult for me to understand. I asked where she was located, and she said "offshore". After listening to her ramble on for a bit, reciting the same old PayPal articles, I said "this is enough"! "Can you help me resolve this insane issue"? She offered no solution, and was not interested in helping. She was not interested in my frustration, or dissatisfaction in PayPal.

This basically means that whatever amount is in my Paypal account is not real.\n\nThe fact that you do not allow transfers to same currency accounts or transfers to credit cards, like you do allow in the US, makes it seem like a dirty business to me. Customers can not avoid your unreal currency conversion rates, no matter what they do.\nYou have made very specific restrictions to make sure that you can earn a lot of money from people\'s lack of ability to see through complex set of rules and restrictions. The intensity with which you screw over customers far exceeds any other banks and payment services, inlcuding international banks/payment services like Lunar, Revolut, and Wise.\nEthically, I would say that your business model in Denmark, and in other EU countries, is questionable. This has made my view of Paypal change very much.\n\nMy specific issue is that I need to withdraw 7,000 EUR from my account in total. As you do not allow me to transfer the money to a EUR account and do not allow me to transfer to a credit card, I would need to accept a conversion rate from EUR to DKK that is far below the market rate and far below the rate of any other bank.\nAs an example I could mention Revolut. Their rate is 7.44 DKK/EUR against the market rate of 7.45 DKK/EUR, and if converting an amount exceeding 1,000EUR per rolling month with Revolut, there is a 1% fee. Let us say that I want to convert everything at once; The fee will amount to 6,000EUR*1%=60EUR and I would end up with 6,940EUR*7.44=51,633DKK. If I let Paypal do this conversion I would have to accept a rate of 7.227DKK/EUR, which is 3% below the market rate.\n>This amounts to 7,000EUR*7.227=50,589DKK, which equals 3 times as high a cost than that of Revolut, given that I convert everything at once. - Or 1,044DKK extra, compared to Revolut.\nWith Revolut or Wise I am not forced to convert anything, as I can transfer the Euros directly to another Euro account. This also means that the amount of money in my account reflects very well the actual amount that I can spend, where as it does not in my Paypal account.\n\nThis constellation seems like quite a trick and I am in doubt whether this would be seen as ethically acceptable by the Danish or European banking authorities.\n"\n\nThey replied:\n"... Here at PayPal we\'re only able to transfer funds to your local bank account in the local currency of the country that your account is registred in. Since this is account is registred in Denmark you will only be able to send DKK to a Danish bank account, through a normal withdrawal.\n\nThe reason that there is different things allowed in different countries varies depending on a variety of reasons, such as but not limited to: Regulations, Permission we have, How a fiinancial system works and our _intergreation_ in said market.\n..."\n\nYes exactly, the reason is their "integration" into the market, where they could easily let customers withdraw to a same currency account. They just choose not to, to earn money on the insane conversion rate that they have.\nIt does not have anything to do with regulation.', 'review_date': '2023-09-09', 'review_time': '10:50:14', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
