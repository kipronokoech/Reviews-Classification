I tried to add a proper bank account and still pay pal would not accept my valid bank account. I spent two hours trying to talk to someone and asked for help. The support person hung up on me because he couldn't help me and told me to send the money back to where it came from. (Which would be the network marketing company ). Does that make any sense? ???\nSo.....i rate PayPal as very bad for business .And my recommendation is never ever use PayPal as they hold your money and make it impossible to get it out.", 'review_date': '2019-04-19', 'review_time': '20:29:32', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

They were authorising payments without my permission yet this guy was trying to argue with me. When I asked him to spell his name for me, he refused. I could barely understood it when he first said it. Then he hanged up. When I called back, another woman called Rose picked. Again sounded like a made up name. She too didn’t understand what I was trying to explain to her. It was as though they had a transcript or a book in front of them and they were just reading from it. The simple thing which they didn’t want to understand is that, every time I was buying something from eBay and paying by logging into my PayPal account, I was being charged twice. Then I’d get an email saying my payments are being reversed due to some risks. However, one payment would go through and I’d be charged. The item I buy would also be sent out to me. But a couple of times I though the transaction failed so I bought the same thing from a different seller. They explained that eBay was requesting for 2 payments of the same amount. I explained that, if I’ve logged into my PayPal account and before I press the pay button I can see the amount then how is it that eBay can request further payments later. Also if I haven’t saved my card details with eBay but only PayPal then how can they charge a card which eBay does not have the details for?\n\nBasically, PayPal has some issues. I’ve had 3 different cards saved with PayPal. Lately they kept charging 2 cards at the same time for the same product and amount. One of the rep previously admitted that there was a glitch but now they are trying to shift the blame.\n\nBe carful and keep an eye out for any payments you make.', 'review_date': '2019-04-18', 'review_time': '12:36:15', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
