PayPal for developers is troublesome for several reasons:\n- Their documentation is subpar. Not because it's poorly written, but due to its confusing navigation. Finding the necessary information is a real challenge, and it's hard to make sense of it. Additionally, they often omit details about certain restricted APIs.\n- PayPal's support is equally frustrating. Their response times are excruciatingly slow. The typical workflow goes like this: You describe your issue, then wait for a day. The next day, when their response finally arrives, you reply, and the cycle continues with another day of waiting. Furthermore, their staff can be quite inept. They may offer incorrect advice initially, only for another staff member to correct it days later. It's simply absurd.\n\nI strongly advise against using PayPal. If you require payment support, opt for Stripe instead. It is light years ahead in terms of quality and developer-friendliness.", 'review_date': '2023-09-02', 'review_time': '12:12:27', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
