So I bought it. Wen it came it was second hand and didn't even work . I raised a dispute with PayPal and the seller.i could not leave any evidence of my case or even access my messages on PayPal so I could not leave anything that was any good to them to fight my case.I called the number that was advertised online for PayPal it was an American number and when I got my bill for my phone it charged me £7 just for that phone call and I did not even speak to a human. This is out of order and the biggest scam of ever heard of I will be reporting PayPal and the seller to watch dogs and I hope they close a company down. I will advise whoever wants to use PayPal do not as you will lose your money and waste your time. I am only doing this to warm people because I have gave up and I will be speaking to the ombudsman about this through my bank this is out of order and an unacceptable in this day and age it's supposed to be trusted online not a scam from both companies the seller and PayPal are working together as the seller as I explained earlier was a UK seller but instead of them returning it to the UK the seller is asking me to send it to Hong Kong that would cost the same price I paid for the item. So again people be warned and I will be putting up post everyday about this I am going to make it my mission to close PayPal down.thank you for reading this review and I hope this is interesting for everybody that is looking to get paid.", 'review_date': '2020-10-01', 'review_time': '14:32:25', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
