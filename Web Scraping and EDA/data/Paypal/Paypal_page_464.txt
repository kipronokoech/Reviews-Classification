Side comment - there was nothing on the merchant site stating I would be charged in the local currency, and all the items on the website were priced in USD. As the item I purchased was not in stock the merchant refunded my payment the following working day which was fine, but as this was via Paypay I then got a lesser amount back (and not what Paypal charged a few days prior). It's pretty unpleasant for customers to get a lesser amount back - especially as there was not real fluctuation in FX over the weekend.
