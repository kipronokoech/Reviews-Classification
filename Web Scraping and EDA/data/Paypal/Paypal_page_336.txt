I do understand most people only leave a review when they are unhappy but, they don’t even seem to be interested in trying to respond or defend themselves here.\nWe all like to make money, increase revenue and cover costs but, most people and institutions with integrity will try to do that with morales and understanding.\nI am talking amongst many things the fact that when someone buys something by mistake or changes their mind the seller takes the hit through no fault of there own and PayPal keeps the fees. Also they charge a £12 fee when they rule a decision in the buyers favour which surely is a reason to help them reach their resolution. Their buyer and seller protection is more a BS clause. Also this make me think when they say another financial company has clawed the money back is this really the case, who will ever know.\nOne consolation is people are getting a bit more savvy now and can see through the garbage they are fed.', 'review_date': '2021-05-11', 'review_time': '00:16:41', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
