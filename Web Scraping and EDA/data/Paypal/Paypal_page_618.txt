The best in humanity & solidarity to reach-out & help each other.

One buyer asked whether he could pay with his credit card, we thought to help him out and be flexible. An invoice in Quickbooks is sent which is linked to paypal. The nightmare began.\n\nTo make a long story short, Paypal has arbitrarily held our payment of $19K, as we could not pay our suppliers, our employees and business costs during this crisis. 1) There is no warm body to call and it is extremely difficult to reach them via chat. 2) A moving target of ever increasing ask of all the documents including business registration, driving licenses of directors (which have been provided when opening accounts) 3) Ask us to send shipping bill, which we have. Then they asked us to provide the customer signed delivery document ( Machines takes a long time to arrive at customer during this lockdown). Then ask us to reach out the buyer to let him confirm to Paypal in an email. 4) When the buyer confirms it to paypal in an email, they say the limitation on account is lifted, but the payment is still held. 5) When we reach out, they said back office is in charge of limitation on account review, and some other "people" will review the payment hold.\n\nIt took more than 3 weeks with painful back and forth communications, and sleepless nights to get it solved. In the end, we just don\'t even want to cancel the order - refund the customer, and get our machine back.\n\nIt is so ironic to see Paypal CEO\'s message to support during coronavirus when you open your paypal account.
