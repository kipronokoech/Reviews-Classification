Payment was via PayPal and currency was USD for a total of $1,316.34 ($1,044.99 plus shipping/customs of $271.35). This translated into £1,113.94 GBP.\n\nThe seller on eBay sent me the wrong item and I had to return this for a refund. The refund was in USD as payment was for an overseas seller. Looking at just the refund for the laptop, only £811.54 was received for the laptop ($1,044.99) and I am still pending the refund on the shipping. Here, I have lost over £70 and this will likely increase once I receive the shipping refund if this is in USD which is more than likely.\n\nThis reflects a fundamental flaw in the eBay Global Shipping Programme as liability for mistakes and foreign exchange risk associated with this should be allocated to the relevant party which in this case is the seller for sending me the wrong item. For example, it would be understandable if unwanted items (liability with buyer) could incur an FX cost but for cases where it is with the seller, i.e. broken items or incorrect items shipped, this should be fully with the seller to absorb.\n\nPayPal on the other hand have demonstrated what great service they can provide and good customer service. In this case, and as a once off exception they credited me the difference of circa £70 for the product, but this was once off and outside of eBay. I now await the impact/loss that may be incurred once the shipping/import fee is refunded.', 'review_date': '2019-10-22', 'review_time': '18:14:45', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

And also informed them my new address, which they refused to accept!\nInstead they informed me, that I can’t use my mobile number in France as the address in their system was from Spain!\nPeople can move between any EU state freely and use any mobile operator from any EU country, so some US corporation can’t make EU laws! That’s why we vote representatives to EU parliament.\nBecause I had moved my financial needs to TransferWise, I just asked them to close my account as “your services are not needed”. They had disabled my access to the “close account” button.\nInstead they started to spam me with requests: “we can’t lift your receiving limits before following documents are received…”. I had no intentions to receive more money using PayPal services, so I just considered it as spam. I got five of such kind of standard answers in total, each time I tried to explain that according the law and your service agreement, I have right to close my account and end using your services.\nFinally, I travelled to Luxembourg to ask personally close my account.\nI have noticed them about their “Terms of Service”, which states clearly that I can close my account anytime.\nThe persons in PayPal Luxembourg office understood my frustration as I had travelled something 1000 Kilometers just to close my account. But they where limited to do that in their office, so they just took my statement and apologized that maybe there has been some miscommunication. So, they promised to get things done within days.\nAnd somebody from “Executive Decisions” department really come back to me. However, somehow they had just restricted me to access anymore to their services. He asked, can I provide any document from past 12 months from Spain or if I have resided another country, then documents from that country within 48 hours.\nMy access to my account was reestablished exactly when this 48 hour period passed, so I provided them “Election de Domilication”, which is a statement that I have been residing France more than 3 months and have legal rights for official residency as I wasn’t even in Spain more than 12 months.\nHowever, my account was still open and no further communication from PayPal. So, I hired a law office to represent my case.\nAnd I got most interesting answer from PayPal Legal Department. They offered, that I have to open another PayPal account using my address in France and then they are able to transfer my remaining funds from my previous account to this account!\nAlso, they accused me that I haven’t been reading their “Terms of Service” properly. Even those are constantly changing, I always read those and nowhere there is mentioned, that they have right to demand people using “credit cards” and “utility companies”. However, those terms have been always clear, that I have right to close my account!\nSo, those few EUROs that they desperately trying to keep themselves isn’t worth for me to take further actions against them. However, as California and Luxembourg have legalized weed smoking, I’m sure that their customer service is busy on such kind of activity, when they deal with customers. So, use my remaining money to buy yourself weed. For people, who expect to deal with businesses that respect law and agreements, I do not recommend to use PayPal services and reported to SEC, how this company is misleading investors when reporting numbers of customers.', 'review_date': '2019-10-22', 'review_time': '17:07:20', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
