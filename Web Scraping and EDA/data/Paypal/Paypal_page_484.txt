Stop doing that. China is committing genocide in Tibet since the 50's, among the christians and muslims for years, force women to abortion, etc. Second: paypal can not be trusted and I say that after being a customer for 22 (!) years. I reread the users agreement, and I have never done anything wrong, used it for receiving small amounts but mainly to pay ebay, googleplay, crowdfunding sites, nothing illegal. After I send them a msg concerning a spoofmail, they responded by ending my account (!), hijacking my 250 euro (they say for a maximum of 180 days!) and that is it. In my case that is NOT it. I m going to gather others in Europe to go to court together and make sure they get the worst publicity in history. More over I am going to start an active campaign to huge platforms that ask their users to use their paypal account and ask them to change that to other options.
