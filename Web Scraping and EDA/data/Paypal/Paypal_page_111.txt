I wasnt able to pay for a simple invoice and wasted 40 mins by trying it... ok.. lets call paypal... go to call paypal menu at 9am GMT... They give you a "one time pass code" but give you no phone number to actually call!!! You dont even know what phone number you need to call... I mean how dumb a manager has to be to approve a website design on the call menu without showing/providing a phone number?! This is when I felt that they actually try to make my life miserable and trying to put barriers to prevent me to actually contact them. I spent 5 mins again on Google to find their phone number.

Their "online community" is flooded with unanswered questions... Paypal dont think their customers are important enough to give a customer service for that 3.4% fees they grab from online sellers. Just take the money and run...\nIn fact Im very happy that Ebay is getting rid of Paypal. I guess if Elon Musk would go back to Paypal would do the same as with Twitter.
