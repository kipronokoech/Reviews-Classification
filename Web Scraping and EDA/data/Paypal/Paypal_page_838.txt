Surely PayPal should foot that bill?\nAlso - in this case, just so you actually know how many people abuse their buyer protection which leaves us sellers out of pocket - this buyer bought an item from me on eBay and paid by PayPal.\nI sent the item. She LEFT FEEDBACK saying she had the item and was happy. A month later she opens a case with PayPal saying she didn't authorise the transaction. I sell items for £3 and it is not worth getting tracked postage so I didn't even contest this and agreed to refund her everything, putting me out of pocket. I didn't even fight and now they send me an email saying I am being charged £14 on top for this! I could understand if she said she had never received the item and I couldn't prove she had but when it was over an unauthorised transaction which she said SHE DID then that's absolutely ridiculous. Why aren't they supporting sellers more and using common sense??\nAlso, i would appreciate it if PayPal actually read and understood my customer service emails before they replied as I've emailed PayPal in the past and I DO NOT WANT AN AUTOMATED EMAIL that doesn't actually answer my question again.\nConsidering it's the sellers/receivers that actually pay money to PayPal, you'd think they'd be more supportive.
