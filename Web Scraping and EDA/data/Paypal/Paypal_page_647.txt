Which is absolutely hilarious to me because I make purchases. From Africa using PayPal, and the UK AND EVEN from Australia, but when I send. My own self $300 from my PayPal account to my debit card It\'s fraudulent.. and you cannot believe the amount a paperwork it takes for me to verify that it\'s me. I had to send my ID. I had to send bank account information\'s not from One bank, but from two different banks because I had to show that my account Had transactions for the past six months BUT IT ALSO HAD TO SHOW AT THE SAME TIME my name and my address all on the same document which I still to this very moment AM NOT VERIFIED SMH..I was baffled LIKE DAMN I THOUGH GOING PAPERLESS WAS SMART.... it\'s not enough that you see the bank accounts name ,my name and my address logged into a bank account via screenshot.. I mean Common Sense through this verification process has just left the freaking window..then having to send them documents to prove my address. I thought it was a simple as getting a letter take a picture that has MY NAME AND ADDRESS ON IT, but nOOOo. You have to open the letter all the way? Like come on PayPal?

I\'m telling you this. If this issue is not resolved by tomorrow, I\'m going to have a major spaz out.

I\'m just going to put you on hold because I have 30 minutes left and I rather sit here and do nothing and go home" and His Name was Cory but he says he goes by CJ So I hope you never have to work with Cory aka cj because he just wants to go home......
