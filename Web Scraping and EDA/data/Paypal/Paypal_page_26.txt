PayPal, because I had not just opened up the case with them. Also, my bank had taken the money that was robbed from me and they robbed me(PayPal) he explained it as if I was the person trying to dupe them and saying I was double dipping, when I was the person that got robbed and got hacked, and seen that it happened I opened up a case and seeing that they didn’t take care of it with another appropriate time noticed that it also went through my bank so I opened up a case with them to be there and be notified by them three weeks later after getting the runaround that because I did that they took the money refunded it to the company that it was coming from and since they paid for it to that company, they expected their money back and took it out of my account a.k.a.

Yes, we took the money, directly from your account, without you agreeing , the representatives were disrespectful, and the higher representatives were functionally unintelligent beings that are drones run by a corporation that over $300.

On August 28, 2023, my business account was permanently limited without any clear explanation, causing significant financial strain and loss of reputation.\n\nPrior to this, I received an email on August 22, 2023, asking for additional information related to my business. The deadline for this was set for October 6, 2023. I tried to upload the required documents on August 25 and 26 but was met with consistent error messages. I even tried different browsers and incognito mode, but nothing worked.\n\nI contacted PayPal Customer Service on August 27 and spoke with a representative named Ailene. She advised me to email the necessary documents for account verification. I did so promptly, and she assured me that the verification team would review the materials and respond by September 1, 2023.\n\nShockingly, just a few hours after my submission, I received an email stating that my account had been permanently limited. I have reached out to PayPal multiple times to resolve this issue but have not received a satisfactory resolution or even a clear reason for the limitation.\n\nI understand that PayPal has policies to protect its users, but the lack of transparency and the abrupt action taken against my account without giving me an opportunity to address any concerns is deeply unsettling. I hope that sharing my experience here prompts a thorough review of my case and helps others be aware of the potential issues they may face.', 'review_date': '2023-08-28', 'review_time': '17:09:41', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

From the first second, he was looking for ways to find how this whole this was my fault. He then finds an option I had chosen in the "contact us" process/form, which I told him I had just chosen the top option JUST to get to the part where I could write my side of the story as it was Saturday and their phonelines were closed that day, he rushes off to his supervisor and comes back all happy now that he was able to tell me he is NOT GOING TO DO ANYTHING! He sounded like a kid on Christmas! The backstory: I order something online, PayPal automatically converted the amount from the original USD to my local currency which ended in an unreasonable amount so I ONLY wanted them to let me use USD or refund me the difference. They automatically again sent me a mail that the WHOLE amount was going to be refunded, so then now the shop SUSPENDED me because it looks like Im a fraud to them, which I cant blame them for. All while PayPal REFUSES to even help me and have people like Nahoom LOOKING for ways to AVOID helping a 15 or 20+ year LOYAL customer. How is that NOT shocking???? Hence the title of this review!! All I asked Nahoom and PayPal was tell the shop what I had wrote to them, that I had NOT asked PayPal for a refund, onøy to switch the currency back WITHOUT PayPal forcing me to use their conversion which ended like 20 USD higher than my bank would convert. Nahoom said no, and said hus Supervisor agreed and that he wont do anything else either. Now I have sent a complaint, asked for another supervisor to call me. Will update this review if I have something to report!
