Their reason for this is non existent and their helpfulness in resolving accessing my funds faster is a joke. For the first item the buyer paid by Paypal, but as it was a bike I did not post it and they collected it 2 hours after the auction ended. I marked it as despatched and the buyer gave me positive feedback on eBay. However when speaking to Paypal via the telephone to resolve the 'pending balance' the person on the phone informed me that I needed to provide a tracking number for the item. The buyer collected the item the same day that the auction ended and therefore could not provide a tracking number. I advised that the transaction had been completed and the buyer had left me positive feedback on eBay. However the person on the phone informed me that Paypal do not accept positive feedback as evidence of a problem free transaction as, apparently sellers ask buyers to leave positive feedback before items have been sent. I did however emphasise that this was not the case as I was not sending the item and it clearly stated on my eBay listing that the item was for 'collection only'. I was then told that for collection only items it is best if buyers pay cash on collection. This is all very well after the fact. I was then advised to contact the buyer to ask them to mark the item as 'received' in a drop down menu on the listing. The buyer tried looking for this icon in order to help me out but was unable to find this. I think it is out of order that as a customer of Paypal I have to chase up in my own time something which they could do themselves. What am I paying Paypal a fee for, if I am doing their work for them?\n\nIt is absolutely ridiculous that Paypal will now be holding my money for up to 21 days when I have done everything correctly and everything from mine and the buyers points of view has gone smoothly.\n\nMy account has been in good order and I have bought and sold things via Paypal often.
