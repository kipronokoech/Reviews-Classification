PayPal was unwilling to assist in opening a dispute/issuing a refund even when sufficient evidence was provided that I was scammed and no product was delivered.

I made a purchase from New Chic UK Limited, which was a Jacket & a pair of shoes, I didn't receive any emails from New Chic UK after 6 days so to covered myself by opening a case in Paypal seeing as My transaction went though my Paypal account as all my online purchases do. I received the £78.00 jacket & to state Quality Seconds is an understatement, the jacket was not the colour stated on the website is was meant to be orange but was a red/orange, the sizing was also totally wrong M tag up to 46 inch chest, I'm a 40 inch chest & I couldn't even do the jacket up. The quality was very poor to say the least, the Stitching was allover the place & not the same from left to right of the jacket. The jacket arrived with a My Hermes Label on, so I assumed the company was in fact in the UK. But it didn't have a returns address on the label THAT'S because it was from China .... I did ask this question in my Paypal claim but didn't get a response from the seller. To now be told by Paypal that its a scam company in China ( so why dose Paypal allow purchases to go though if they know its a scam company.??? ) I've not to date received the pair of shoes, but I've had a My Hermes card put though my front door ( saying sorry we missed you ) but not heard or received the shoes I'd purchased. To cap all this, I'm now being told by Paypal that If I want a refund I've got to send the jacket back to china !!! how disgusting it this I've now raised a complaint though Watchdog & Rip off Britain because this should not be happening to anyone that holds a Paypal account. Once this is resolved I'll be closing my paypal account & stop all my online shopping. How can Paypal legally allow transactions to go though when these companies are lying to customers making out they are in the UK when they are Clearly NOT, this is fraud & it needs the be addressed as like all overseas sellers stating they are in the United Kingdom when they are clearly NOT. Ebay is a big part of this fraud as well & Paypal & ebay need to address it once & for all.

I lost more than 100 EUR and trust in a used-to-be reliable counterparty. I bought a wig from China. The article came not as described on the webpage of the seller: the color was clearly different. There were also attached metal combs to the underside of the wig, which were not in the description of the product. The seller acknowledged the problems and wanted to compensate partially offering a 25% discount. I did not agree because this wig would be useless and wanted to return the wig. According to the seller\'s website the return was possible. After I denied the 25% discount PayPal resolved the case in favor of the seller!! The explanation was: color difference wasn\'t significant. \'It should have been blond instead of radical black hair to be qualified as \'significantly different\'\' according to PayPal. This explanation is arbitrary and could not be qualified as a serious one because 1) the seller himself acknowledged that the color was different; 2) on the website of the seller these colors (see picture) go under different numbers; 3) a color of a wig is a crucial characteristic of a product (not like color of a digital gadget); 4) the explanation dismisses that the seller omitted the description of the metal combs, which make the wig unsuitable for people with no hairs. To aggravate the problem PayPal ruled very fast in the favor of the seller, preventing him from offering a higher discount, which he wanted to give me according to his email. The explanation of the PayPal was blunt: "we are not negotiation platform". In the end PayPal destroyed my trust totally justifying 1.2 stars from TrustPilot and gave more confidence to a website which is listed among scam shops.
