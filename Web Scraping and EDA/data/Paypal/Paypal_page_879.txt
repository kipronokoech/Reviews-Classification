Payment was received from buyer (who had zero feedback) at the end of auction. I properly secured the package and shipped via USPS Priority mail at free of charge the next day. I took a photo of the package for me records.\nA few days letter I checked to see if the pakcage had arrived because it was rather expensive and it had. A day and a half goes by and I receive a message from the buyer stating the package was ripped apart and she was disappointed and wanted a refund. I politely told her that unfortunately I share in her pain that I\'m unable to issue a refund because she didnt request to buy insurance for her package and I am not responsible for anything that happens during transit because it\'s out of my hands.\nThe buyer opens a claim with Paypal. We both plead our case. Paypal finds in favor of the buyer.\nI called paypal several times to speak to a supervisor as to their policy and reasoning behind their decision. My calls were dropped the first couple of times. On the last try I was able to get transfered. Lisa got on the phone in an unprofession manner by saying "what?" (I don\'t think that she realized that the call had been transfered). She didn\'t apologize or greet me in a friendly manner. She read through the notes in the claim and said that even though it\'s not my fault I have to eat the cost because I didn\'t buy the insurance as a seller to protect myself. She was quite hostile and unfriendly. I explained to her that it was the buyers responsibility to buy the insurance because I didn\'t offer the insurance with my free shipping. I went on to explain to her that if I was expecting a $400 package I would\'ve bought insurance for the package, or at the very least inquired if insurance could be purchase, and that the buyer waited a day and a half to contact me about the package.\nShe said that I was right but that I would need to take it up with the USPS. I said why is it my responsibility to do that. I did everything in my power to make sure that the item I sold got there safely (which it did). I cant control the day a half the package was in the buyers possession. She then got really rude. started yelling over my debate. Very unprofessional.\nMoral of the story is, Paypal will protect themselves from liability over buyers and sellers. Should I have gotten insurance to protect myself, knowing what I know now YES. But I feel like I did everything in my power to get the package to my buyer as described and I end up getting punished for it.\nSo sellers be careful. Protect yourself cause Paypal wont. They only care about the percentages they\'re taking from you.', 'review_date': '2015-12-16', 'review_time': '23:02:27', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

Special treat - customer support.', 'message': "Below is a short summary of a many year experience. Near-expert user level, both business and private.\n\nRates: not good.\nWay too high currency exchange rates. Many banks would offer better rates, at least in my country. If some currency moves significantly in your favor on currency exchange (think EUR/USD and real-time forex), it will not take any visible effect on your PayPal exchange rate for the nearest days. The gap is always there for PayPal to use against you.\n\nWithdrawal options: very limited and expensive.\nExtremely limited withdrawal options. Credit card with ridiculous daily limit and high fee per transaction on top of the conversion rates already paid to PayPal. Will limit your business operations significantly due to slow and expensive cash recovery from PayPal. Withdrawal to bank account is free and available in US only. Try and get a US bank account living in Europe, good luck with that. Recent changes in favor of EU citizens to be able to use local banks are either ignored or sabotaged by PayPal staff in order not to give the same freedom of funds withdrawal as to US customers.\n\nCustomer support? New Deli's brightest. A human robot army.\nTerrible, ignorant, incapable and inefficient customer support. Hire them for your worst competitor. Often hard to understand as their English is far from sufficient. Never competent in anything if you approach them with something that is not in the textbook. They are useless over the phone (if you can reach them) and send canned irrelevant responses over email (if you ever hear back from them, many messages are never replied). Thought this is something a world leader in global payments could not get away with? Think again. PayPal is too big to care about its customers, they are just a resource.\n\nCustomer protection? If you bought something, it may help.\nPayPal is essentially like Ebay (they used to be one company not so long ago). They mostly care about buyers if some transaction goes wrong. This, probably, is the only bright spot in my review – there is actual customer protection in case you need to solve a problem after buying something. Just make sure you are eligible for any customer protection at all as this is not always the case. Still not sure when it works and when it doesn’t.\n\nSummary:\nPayPal may be a necessary evil if doing business on Ebay. Somewhat convenient to use from time to time to purchase/sell something on the internet, but definitely not the guys to trust your money and business. PayPal's only priority is profit, everything else exists just to serve their purpose. Add the above mentioned components and you will see the monster it is.\n\nThis is a true and honest experience, summarized from over 8 years with PayPal. I am not paid by any competitors from Ali Express or Amazon, although I wish them all the success so that they can make PayPal move their fat a** and do something good for their customers. I have not been expelled from PayPal community and “giving back what they deserve”. I am a business and private user who cooperates with the necessary evil and is probably seen as a loyal customer.

Days go by still pending... so i go online and find out why its been so long and its still pending, for it to say it can take up to 21 days so i was like cool better than nothing... until 26 days past and its still sitting saying pending so i call up paypal for them to say okay ill get in contact with him for you and will email or phone you back, got no call back (which for someone who works in a call centre, i take pride that if i am dealing with a customer i will do everything in my will to help them, i take ownership of that call and that customer and always keep my promises - yet they cant even call me back to just update me) and still days on the balance is still pending. so i phone up today to be told that all along i could have cancelled the refund ( Why didnt the last person i spoke to days ago not tell me this? ) which didnt show up at all when i refunded him otherwise i obviously would have cancelled it, the advisor then went on to try calling him for him to hang up as soon as he found out it was paypal. At the end of the day i reported this problem and nothing got done paypal take no responsibility for what happens with your money, they only way i would have got that £10 back is if i opened a dispute where i would have to provide proof of delivery for something i posted like 3 months ago.. when i explained this to the agent on the phone she proceeded to make me feel stupid telling me i should keep receipts for up to 6 months, im sorry but who keeps receipts like that for something they posted months ago?? because i didnt have my proof of postage i wouldnt have been able to make a case i would definitely lose, in the end i basically said it didnt matter who wants to deal with all of that over £10. at the end of the day the money went through paypal they can quite clearly see i refunded the right person as well as this Dave guy so they should have given me my money and then chased him up for the money he would now be due them. absolutely no help at all. its to easy to refund the wrong person, so be warned that they will not even try to help you.", 'review_date': '2015-11-25', 'review_time': '14:09:10', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
