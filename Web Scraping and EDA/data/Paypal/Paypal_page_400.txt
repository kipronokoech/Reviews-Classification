I decided to pay via paypal due to buyer protection and money refund they offer incase of fraudulent and  scam activities which actually happened in this situation. I actually called paypal twice and placed on hold for a very long time\ni spoke to two unhelpful representatives who could not simply understand that i was scammed and that returning  a product to Hong Kong from london would be more than the actually price of the product. I have checked royal mail amongst other online international delivery service and they go up to 25 pounds and this is without tracking added. I kept reiterating this over and over again.. and all your representative keeps saying "i understand" over and over again, when they clearly don\'t.. do you not train your staff to have informative and good communication skills to deal with queries? I am completely disgusted at the fact that you condoned Companies to provide scam services on your platform and provide an action to a case for me to spend money to pay more money to send a product back to the company who scammed me. In what world does this makes sense? So i going spend 25-35 pounds of my cash to send something back and be reimbursed 15 pounds? That means i am spending more which defeats the  purpose of me getting my money back. I\'m actually at a loss. Now i am in a situation where i can\'t return the product because the amount paypal pays to cover the shipping isn\'t enough and i am left with a faulty product. I am disgusted with the response of paypal and their representatives.They are very rude, unhelpful, Give out i don\'t care vibes and give flippant answers with suggestions that i should go contact my bank and i should go search cheap delivery options when 1. I used paypal for a reason for safe transaction. I explained the rates that delivery goes for and your staff did not care to understand my problem. I also provided enough evidence in my case to prove i was scammed. Its a shame that I had to leave a negative review but i didn\'t have this company down as promoting scam companies.. i know things are rough due to the current climate but this is foul. You should be ashamed of yourselves.\n\nI have taken this case further with the financial ombudsman services.', 'review_date': '2021-02-14', 'review_time': '18:01:59', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
