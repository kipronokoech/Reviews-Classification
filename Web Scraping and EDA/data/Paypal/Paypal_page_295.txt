I Received email saying they have found in favor of seller literally 3 hours later per our conversation via paypal representation stated 10 days to investigate. What there to favor as I'm paying someone my hard earned money with nothing on return yet. I will be discontinue paypal after I receive all monies owed and will pursue with fraud division through my Bank as I have all the documentation from sellers and paypal unethical power play done. Ridiculous it's suppose to be free to transfer money via family and friends but charged me a fee of $2.70 on $270 transfer now most time within 3min. I've tried to do 1 to 3 day free deposits and it ask me for all my banking info that they have already as if I transfer money now with there fee it has all banking info. It does not make sense well it does as thieves are thieves. Now as of today went to transfer $270 and the fee is 1.5% which equals a new fee of $4.05 for $ 270. I never received any documentation stating the increase at all so they are able to change policy without acknowledgement to consumers.
