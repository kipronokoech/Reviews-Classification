I tried to order three indoor rugs for my new home and they told me to create a Paypal account. So I did. Although, PayPal charged me money in order to "confirm" my bank account. Then they made me enter my credit card number numerous times! Then they had me put in my check info and I did. At the end, my account is still limited. I called the number and for some reason the person told me to reset my router and my modem(???). The website told me to wait for a letter confirming I live in the address I enter. I waited about several weeks. The letter came and I confirmed it. Nothing happened. A few days later, I received an email saying my account was SUSPENDED! And it said I cannot use another account OR CREATE ANOTHER ONE! Not only Paypal limited my account and blocked me and STOPPED my account, it said I can not use eBay in ANY WAY! I posted a listing of a dress a few days earlier, and they took my listing off for no reason. All they said was that "your listing has been taken off unless you confirm your Paypal account is yours and to confirm your bank account. Your credit card shows that there is no such card." My card is CORRECT and HASN\'T BEEN EXPIRED! Now they banned me from eBay and PayPal and I won\'t be able to use these horrible websites in any way. In the end I had my friend order them for me and they arrived. One rug was made of recycled plastic.(?!?!) it never said that on the description,\nIf I were you, please read this review and never EVER buy on eBay or use PayPal. They are liars and all about greed for money. That\'s why they charged me for nothing just to "confirm" my account.\n\nPLEASE DONT EVER USE EBAY OR PAYPAL BECAUSE ALL THEY CARE ABOUT IS MONEY AND THEY WILL CHARGE YOU FEES. JUST DONT....USE EBAY! IT\'S HORRIBLE!!!\nI spent over a week and a half trying just to order rugs.', 'review_date': '2013-07-05', 'review_time': '16:27:04', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

I went through the US postal service and they investigated her and found in my favor. Sometimes things take time to solve. But they offered her the money or the item with no claim on the insurance, that went to me. I offer a refund if not as described, but you must return the item or items and the defect must not be from shipping (Insurance). All these things have to be listed in your seller agreement policies to ensure the sellers funds as well as the buyers are protected.\nMy sells are from all around the world I always get my money I retain a 100% feedback.\nSadly there are frauds on both sides of the fence, and sometimes hard to see.

The person I talked to on the phone assured me that with a PayPal account and nothing more, I could sell and buy with ease on ebay. after speaking with another customer service representative, he informed me that I could not do anything on a PayPal account without a bank account, and I would have to give them my bank account and routing numbers in order to have my money returned me. Originally it was told me that my money can be deposited on the debit card I had already used to start my paypal account. after still not being able to receive my money, because payPal refused to send it to me, I spoke with two more representatives. They then told me I could get my money without having a bank account registered to PayPal if I ordered a PayPal prepaid debit card. when I get the card in the mail about 12 days later, its a generic card. It is not connected to my account. It says there's no money on my account. incredibly frustrating. So then I get online, go to activate my card after speaking with representatives that refuses to activate my card, I fill out information for 15 minutes before PayPal tells me that it will not process my request. the 5th customer service representative I spoke too, who is probably lying too, told me that the first four people that I spoke to were all wrong ( when really they were just lying). I don't think I have ever been so dissatisfied with any company, service, product or any other in my life. after going through all of this for more than 2 months, I still don't know if my paypal card is activated, and I do know why it will not work with my account.. so needless to say, payPal is content holding on to my mind, lying and lying and lying, and they will do anything to make a buck. absolutely ridiculous, and I've had better luck understanding the foriegners that any other company uses over PayPal.
