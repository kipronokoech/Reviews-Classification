I have reported this to the police and I will send the document to my bank and to other national authorities.\nYou need to report Paypal as much as possible and quickly, this is a serious matter of safety.

In the interim I had paid for something else that cost $30 with Paypal, leaving $150 in my Paypal account. When the buyer requested the return Paypal froze the money in my account. OK, I can accept that. I approved the return, but because part of the damage was caused after the item was received and obviously by carelessness and neglect on the part of the buyer, I offered a lessor refund. Despite photographic evidence PROVIDED BY THE BUYER, ebay allowed the full refund anyway ( a whole other review i have yet to write). THEN the real trouble started. Paypal paid ebay for the return, but instead of taking it from the frozen funds that sere there specifically for this transaction, they deducted the whole $180 from my checking account without warning, leaving me overdrawn. All they needed was $30, but took the entire $180. But they kept the frozen funds and withdrew them from me again. Obviously, I\'m not a person with lots of money. This hurt. I spent hours on the phone just asking why. I never got that answer from the Paypal rep who, by the way, was in the Philippines, and told me he could not transfer me to a representative in the USA, which they MUST lawfully do if you ask. But this guy actually ADMITTED to me that they took money from my checking even though they had it frozen for the purpose of paying this very transaction. I told him that "taking money that doesn\'t belong to you is stealing. Even if you only take it and keep it for three days and then make it available again to the owner, that is still theft. And you admitted it to me while recording it yourself." I will never use either ebay or Paypal for anything again.\nIn addition to this, my sister, who is an ebay Power Seller, with more than 30,000 transactions and a 98% rating on ebay has reduced her use of ebay recently and recently decided to stop using them altogether. They have changed their rules and behavior so much over the last few years that they have no respect for newer users and less for sellers than buyers, placing extreme requirements and restrictions and initiating charges without warning. All decisions go to the user with the higher number transaction history or chance of making ebay and Paypal the most money.', 'review_date': '2016-08-23', 'review_time': '16:26:27', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
