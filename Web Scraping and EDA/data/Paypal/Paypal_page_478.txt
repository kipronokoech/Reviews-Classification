Raised a dispute with Paypal due to receiving goods (from China) which were totally not as advertised. The advert, description and pictures were absolutely nothing like I received. Provided Paypal with Pictures of the advert and pictures of the goods received. Dispute raised with them and after months of going back and forth I was advised to return the goods (at my expense £7.35) in order to receive a refund. I did this and provided photos of the packaged items (in progress and completed packaging) and provided a copy of my Royal Mail receipt. They decided to close the case in favour of the buyer as the tracking info was not enough. It is obvious that this Chinese company are complete scammers (I've researched them after my experience) and how PayPal can research them and resolve in the same opinion is beyond me. They are completely enabling these companies to rip off genuine paying customers. Their 'buyer protection' is non existent and they should not be offering this. Will NOT be using PayPal whenever other payment options area available with any future online purchases I make. Credit Card it is for me from now on. Well done PayPal, hopefully you'll continue to reep the benefits of these Scammers Fees whilst your customers continue to suffer at the hands of you and the scammers.", 'review_date': '2020-10-20', 'review_time': '15:16:05', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

I have been reading the last reviews and have experienced exactly the same treatment. I selected the delayed payment option when buying a dog bed (unbeknown to me from China). The bed arrived, nothing like what I ordered so told PayPal not to pay them but they did. I was told to send it back with tracking for a refund which I duly did for £18 postage! I never got a refund from the seller (I know don’t laugh - naivety at its best). I had set up a dispute request with PayPal who requested photos of sent Items and tracking numbers etc which I did. This started in March’20. The PayPal site is almost impossible to communicate on, it’s cumbersome to write and read on with tags going over your messages, there is never a date on the messages so you can’t have a record of the date (note: always start each message with a date for your records). There is no phone number that works as they navigate you out with robots and press buttons so no ability to talk to or email a real person.\nThe people who you communicate with on your account/the dispute centre are having a laugh and often just press the repeat button without answering your specific question.\nThey sent a proper email on 7 July’20 to say that I have won the case and that they would refund my bank account within 5 days but that has never arrived.\nI‘ve only just raised this and asked where my refund was this week/October. They said that they had already refunded me in February (really, then why email me in July saying that I had now won and will refund me in 5 days...). They came back to me using monetary amounts that my son and friend had paid me (in February) to say that that was the refund from them?!?!?. You could not make this up.\nYou can not believe what this company is now doing and there is no recourse to speak to anyone.
