Over the past 2 months, I\'ve been on the phone with them 20 times - twice speaking with a supervisor. I was told every time that the documentation I provided was perfect and they would re-submit it to their "back office team" with a note - every time it still got denied. I even purchased ($10 fee) a certificate of status from my state for my LLC to prove it was active and in good standing with my state per recommendation from one of their supervisors. After I submitted that, it got denied too. I\'m totally at a loss at what to do and they\'ve basically told me there\'s nothing they can do to help. It\'s a real shame. I would really recommend against using PayPal, especially as a business. You may loose out on a little bit of money, but you\'ll loose out on a lot more headache that they induce. I was fortunate enough to be able to withdrawal the money from my account even though my account is limited. From looking at other reviews on here, it seems I was very lucky since they usually completely lock down your funds (some have thousands being held "hostage" by PayPal). Overall, I\'ve been treated like crap (probably because I\'m just a small one person business) through this whole situation. Before this they had always been very helpful and kind to me. Even if I eventually get this resolved, I don\'t see myself continuing to accept payments via PayPal for very long even if it means I loose some customers.', 'review_date': '2018-12-10', 'review_time': '03:06:04', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
