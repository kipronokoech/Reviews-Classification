In my case it has happened multiple times over the last 10 years and when this happens they suspend your account and prevent you transferring funds to your bank account or spending your money.

Everything was going well getting some sales £30-£90 per order.\n\nAs soon as my sales ramped up in December and i was making serious sales Paypal start giving problems. They initially limited my Paypal account and asked for so many documents and tracking number. After calling them 8 times and submitted the Documents Paypal requested this was not enough and Paypal Permanently Limited my account and £8000 on hold for 180 days\n\nThis upset me so much I called Paypal tried to talk to them as a human. Providing my Amazon links and website. Told them I have 3000 positive reviews on Amazon. NONE of this worked.\n\nPaypal than said try opening another account and it will be ok. As I really wanted to sell on Onbuy I did. Suprise, Suprise same thing happened.\n\nPaypal left me alone while I was making £20-£50 per order Sales. But when my sales started to go to £200- £300 per item my account got limited. After multiple emails and documents this did not work and now £2000 was left on hold for 180 days.\n\nDo not be like me and Do not Risk you lively hood, heart ache and sell on this platform. Onbuy idea was good but 100% Relying on Paypal is a disaster. No wonder Ebay created their own Payment method and are no longer in partnership with Onbuy.\n\nI messaged Onbuy support team and told them about my problem and asked them to contact Paypal but they did not want to help.\n\nYOU CANNOT make another revenue stream when PAYPAL is involved.
