When issues come up they tend to forget you are a customer using their platform and bringing in money for them through sales on eBay etc.\n\nThe issue I have come across is when payments come through to Paypal and initial preffered card payment is declined, they think its ok to take money out of other attached accounts despite the difference in currency. I have been smacked with currency conversion fees because of this. Instead of asking the customer for an alternative preffered payment method, they take it upon their own accord to choose what card/account to withdraw funds.\n\nIf you don't want issues with payments been taken from random credit cards and accounts, I suggest stay away from Paypal until they implement a procedure where customers get notifications and/or a choice where their funds should come from.\n\nIf they sort treat customers like customers and try to help them based on person to person issues then I might return to them.\n\nThere are other alternatives out there that do just the exact thing that Paypal do and some even free that I am exploring.\n\nThought the public deserve to know this.
