They said the proof wasn't submitted properly, and to submit it again. So I did, and was told to wait another 5 days. 10 days later, no change. I reached out again, and was told the same thing. So I submitted different documents. 2 weeks, later. Same thing. I am now on my 8th try of submitting proof, waiting a week and then reaching back out. Support is rarely if ever available, and they usually just copy and past garbage text that isn't helpful at all, then they close the chat so I have to start over again.
