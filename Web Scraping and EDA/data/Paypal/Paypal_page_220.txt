So much for no fee transactions. Hopefully I will never have to use Pay Pal again.

Yes, it is a nice service to get back the fees when sending something back that has been bought using PayPal. But when you register the return they want you to upload the invoice of the mail service and a photo of the package with the label - so good so far. After that you receive an email that they need the confirmation of the vendor that they have received the returned items within the next 14 days. Still ok, but if I do not have this information when uploading the first two documents it might happen (and it happened to me) that you buy the label, upload the documents and then you get this instruction. However, chances are high that I will not have the confirmation of the vendor within 14 days when I request the refund too early… when contacting the customer service too postpone the deadline or at least tell me if I can request it again when I cannot meet the deadline I just received automatic replies that did not help at all. I then tried to reach out by phone. After clicking through 3!!! telephone numbers on their homepage, I finally found one that worked. After clicking trough a 20 level selection, a computer explained to me something I did not ask for and wanted to end the call. After clicking random numbers I finally managed to talk to a person, who then told me that they cannot help and gave me an email address where people are answering questions. So I sent my same message again, this time to this email address. I received a completely stupid answer again which clearly showed that they either do not read messages, do not understand it or just do not care.\n\nLong story short: this is the worst customer service I have ever experienced and this is a payment service company!!!!
