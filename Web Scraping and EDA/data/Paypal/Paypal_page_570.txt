I've ordered an item and got absolutely worthless piece of crap. I've opened a case with PayPal, provided all evidences. At first they told me to return a thing on my own expense to be able to receive my money back(it would cost me the same amount of money and wouldn't make any sense) After long discussion they said I'd get my expense back when a seller gets an item back what sounds very tricky too since it's not save to go to a post office during a current pandemic situation at all plus I have no reason to trust that seller and to put more money on risk. For my proposition to simply give me my money back and then deal with a seller they've just denied a case. I won't use it any more and don't recommend PayPal to anybody", 'review_date': '2020-06-25', 'review_time': '10:49:34', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

This payment service is the worst on the market. I sold a laptop to a customer who refused to pay through any other payment app than paypal (since it was "trustworthy" ) and he gave me $400 as we agreed. However Paypal, Paypal wouldn\'t allow the transaction to go through until I upraded my account to a business account. That was fine. Simple enough right? Wrong! I updated my account then was told I needed my buyer to send an additional $300 to my account to verify that the buyer meant to send me the money. My buyer sent the $300 but didn\'t get the confirmation from paypal that the first $300 made it through, so he sent ANOTHER $300 to make sure it went through. Paypal then merged the previous $400 to the additional $300 sent from the buyer and left it up to me to refund the additional $300 back to the buyer. However, I was not allowed to get the $400 payment or the $300 additional until I refunded the additional $300 back to buyer OUT OF POCKET. Paypal wouldn\'t allow me to do it through paypal so I had to BUY a $300 giftcard to I-tunes and give the codes of the cards to both paypal and the customer. I thought that was the end of it, but then I got another email from paypal saying that the first $300 that the buyer sent to my account, that we thought hadn\'t gone through, did actually go through and now I also needed to refund that $ 300 out of pocket AGAIN! So I had to go out and buy another $300 giftcard for the buyer and paypal to verify. All the while, paypal took $150 out of the $400 I was to gain in profit for "TRANSACTION fees" . So in conclusion I made only $250 for a $400 laptop and had to pay out of pocket $600 because of this ridiculous and fraudulent payment service. Moral of the story: DON\'T EVER USE THIS SERVICE.', 'review_date': '2020-06-25', 'review_time': '00:39:10', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

I received a small plastic bracelet from China, shipped late April 2020 and received in May 2020. Paypal denied my FIRST claim for a refund based on the seller providing a tracking number. They did not notice nor care that it linked to USPS and details were "First Class; small package". I had to open another claim and point that out. Not only has Paypal NOT supported me and provided terrible customer support, their process has allowed the seller 4-6 weeks to respond at each juncture then allowed them extra time to take action. Now that I am being offered a refund, I am given 8 DAYS to return the item, PAYING for shipping to CHINA and then respond to them with the tracking number or my cased is denied again and closed. Here is the real kicker- even that won\'t get my money back. The seller has what appears to be unlimited time to CONFIRM with them that they received the small plastic bracelet and THEN I will get my 282.70 back. No items. Lost time. Lost interest.
