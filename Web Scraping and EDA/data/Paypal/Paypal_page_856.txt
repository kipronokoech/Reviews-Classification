After 2 working weeks (10-12 days) and a considerable amount of money spent to contact the ireland-based costumer care I have been told to relax and wait for the transfer of my balance €719 to my new PayPal account, fully verified and open under my real name. Mind you, this account is the one I opened around 2012 before moving to a foreign country and, complaining with the terms of use, opening a new account there (Slovenia). After another 3 days I received the standard mail that explained to me the total blockage of my money and presented my a request for a proof of address (that has been provided 3 times, using a phone bill, a ID card and a utility bill). Still, probably I will have to wait the customary 180 days. My small business is ruined and I am seriously disappointed. They didn\'t even release my credit card. I tried to be cooperative and to atone for my original mistake about the artist name (fake name for paypal) to no avail.
