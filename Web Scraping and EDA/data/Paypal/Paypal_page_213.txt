Then when I spoke to the person in the UK they told me I had to be transferred again they then kept me on the line for another 5 mins of silence and gave me the number: 8888955705 which was a dead-end number. I then tried to call back and was told that customer support had closed. Was this intentional? I don't know. I missed one email and now my account has been shut down for the sake of ¬£10? This hardly seems justifiable and to top it off with sub-par and incompetent support workers really makes the already painful kick in the balls a lot worse.
