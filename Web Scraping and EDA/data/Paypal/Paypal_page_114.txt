In 2020 PayPay notified me that they were suspended my account for violation of their User Agreement, stating that I would later (180 days) receive an email directing me how to transfer my $2264.97 frozen funds. I have never received any form of communication from PayPal regarding release of my frozen funds. I noticed that my PayPay balance registered as $0.00. I knew that I had over $2200 in my account so I reviewed Transactions to see who emptied my account, thinking that maybe I got Phished in changing my password. To my surprise and dismay I saw that PayPay had transferred my entire $2264.97 balance TO ITSELF !!! for “Damages” caused by my so-called violation of PayPal’s User Agreement. I was flabbergasted since I have been waiting on their email instructions (like they said they would ) how to transfer my balance out of my PayPal account.\nThis arbitrary and contradictory action by PayPal damaged me, not them. They are using their monopolistic position in the marketplace to bully consumers. Big Tech censorship and tyrannical abuse of their economic power at its worst. I don’t use the term “monopolistic” lightly or without a legal basis. I believe PayPal has violated both FCID & RICO Laws. I've researched PayPal complaints and found they have done this to 1,000's of their customers. Confiscating money with no remorse or right to appeal. Many People right here in New Mexico. They hide behind the fine print of so-called policy violations. Written so loosely that they, and they alone can determine if the think you violated their policy. This is their way of stealing money from 1.000's of unwary customers each year. They are immune from FIDC & RICO laws because the do not have Federal Oversight.\nPlease help me get back the money they stoled.", 'review_date': '2023-01-18', 'review_time': '17:28:01', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
