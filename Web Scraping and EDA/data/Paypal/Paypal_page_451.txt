Within 6 hours I had established that eBay had allowed a fraudster to open a business account and list two items totalling ¬£2600. My purchase was for a electric bike. I advised eBay my findings. PayPal wouldn‚Äôt even allow me to speak to a PayPal representative, auto chat responses that didn‚Äôt help. I tried to open a dispute again and PayPal advised you opened and closed dispute. You will not receive a refund. This is true: Due to a judgement error I made opening/ closing dispute PayPal are now refusing to refund me the ¬£1300 (FINAL).

Within a couple of hours I receive a message from PayPal asking if I wanted to change the reason for dispute, with one option only ‚Äòunauthorised activity‚Äô!\nI found this strange as PayPal had previously stated once the dispute was closed the only way to change this was to appeal the decision to close the dispute. I had not appealed the dispute decision, therefore this offer to change reason must of been a override of normal protocols. So I clicked the only option they offered adding information regards the fraudster and eBay suspension. I was of the mind set that PayPal were finally trying to assist my dispute with them, how wrong I was, they had made this offer so there decision to deny my refund was more cemented as it looked like I had falsely reported unauthorised activity. After legal consultation I was told PayPal‚Äôs terms and conditions are ridiculous and don‚Äôt stand in court. PayPal forget they are in the UK and as uk consumers we enjoy protections against corporate thieves the like of PayPal.\nDo the following:\nDispute payment with your bank or credit card company.\nReport fraud to Action fraud police to obtain crime reference number.\nOpen a complaint with Financial Ombudsman and then wait for results, finally small claims court.\nDONT LET THEM STEAL YOUR MONEY.', 'review_date': '2020-11-23', 'review_time': '21:22:22', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
