The thief used my card for a $700 purchase which was made through Pay Pal. Pay Pal NOW offers "virtual terminals" so that every crook in the world can just key in your card with no security and incur a charge that comes straight out of your bank account. Pay Pal was made aware of the fraudulent charges before the transaction ever completed but did NOTHING to stop it. They will pay these crooks and while they have the perfect trail to follow - they will not provide it to authorities because they are a disgusting entity that does NOT care about protection, security, fraud prevention. While their mission statement claims protection and good customer service - that is a JOKE. I closed my account and will never use them again. They are really in the same category as the crooks who stole my card.', 'review_date': '2017-02-13', 'review_time': '18:29:30', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
