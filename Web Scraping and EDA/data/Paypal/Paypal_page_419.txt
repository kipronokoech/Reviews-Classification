I hope this company is ultimately driven out of business by people taking note of the bad reviews here and elsewhere so that they switch to alternative online facilities.\nIn my case my account was "permanently restricted" and I was instructed to log in for further details. When I did I found that PayPal had for some unknown reason permanently restricted my account and set it up for closure because of a payment I made to Just Eat / McDonalds for a takeaway delivery!\nI made numerous attempts to contact PayPal about this and got absolutely nowhere. Calls unanswered, useless message bots, standard emails which don\'t address the issues, you name it.\nYesterday, after being transferred from "Help Desks" [cough] in the Far East and France, I was put through to someone in Ireland who looked at my account and confirmed that he could see no reason why this had happened, but it was \'beyond his pay grade\' to lift the restriction, so he would escalate the matter to senior colleagues. Thirty minutes or so later, I got another standard email from PayPal informing me that I had violated their Acceptable Use Policy but they don\'t have to tell me why!!! Given the facts, it would seem that using PayPal to pay for a takeaway delivery has suddenly become unacceptable use!\nI am disgusted with PayPal and have referred this matter to the Financial Ombudsman.\nI have had a few bad customer service experiences from giant, soulless corporates, but PayPal is by a comfortable margin the very worst that I ever have come across.\nTerrible, terrible company.', 'review_date': '2021-01-07', 'review_time': '11:42:36', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
