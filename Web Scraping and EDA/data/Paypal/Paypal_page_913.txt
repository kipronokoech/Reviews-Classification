I can buy my own shipping and make my own labels.... what right do they have to hold these funds for so long. The lady on the phone with paypal said, "You have the funds" I said NO YOU HAVE THE FUNDS. THERES A DIFFERENCE. I CAN"T USE THEM, SPEND THEM, ETC.

THIEFS.\n\nAnother experience I noticed, is that sometimes when you sold an item on ebay, and buyer opens up a dispute which later buyer did win, so paypal procceeded to refund the buyer money from my account. They refunded the buyer the amount paid and fees 3.9%. So usually the fees has to be returned to buyer , which it happened, but for some reason their buggy system showed that I own paypal buyer's fees which got pulled out from my paypal... THIS IS THEFT...\n\nPAYPAL IS NOT SAFE...
