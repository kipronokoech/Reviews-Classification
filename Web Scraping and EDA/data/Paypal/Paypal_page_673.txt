I eventually put the phone down, called back had to wait in line again for another half hour, then I spoke to somebody else and within 1 minute had told me yes, this transaction was to do with my account and the payment was rejected, which was all I need to know.

Got an email telling me i wasnt in and a card had been left. Had spent all day watching my cctv waiting and he came nowhere near, yodel chat told me driver couldnt find my ordinary terraced house. They apparently tried next day though watching my cameras and the tracking nobody came anywhere near here again, but status just changed to delivered. Yodel chat said it had been delivered to wrong address and the driver had picked it up to deliver it to me. Then Ebuyer and Yodel both insisted they had tracking proving i had received the item and the signature of the Ramu who signed for it looked something like mine. So out of desperation i turned to paypal, after all they tell you using them is as good as using a credit card and you are protected! Rubbish!! They also tell the seller that and the seller is more valuable than a customer of 12 years standing with them and never raised a claim in all that time. Good enough reason to back up Ebuyer and join in on basically calling you a lying theif and facilitating the theft of your money for an item you never received!!!! And as for accountability? They have chatbot AI agents that are rubbish and say call us. Then you phone to fight to talk to someone other than the AI on there. When you do get through you get a callcentre in the Philippines who will tell you they cant make decisions on anything. Thats the contact options.
