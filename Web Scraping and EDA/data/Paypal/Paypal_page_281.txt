A few weeks later, sitll nothing in my Paypal account, which worried me. So I contacted both Payoneer and Paypal, however, I found that the Payoneer agents were much more inclined to help me resolve this issue.\nOut of nowhere, Paypal told me that my funds were "sent back to my Payoneer account", which was obviously not true, as told by Payoneer, who gave me proof of transfer TO PAYPAL. No matter how many times I have shown Paypal proof that the money has been rejected, the proof of transfer stating that the funds were sent back to Paypal, nothing. I have been battling with Paypal for more than 6 months now and have given up. I am never going to see my hard earned money again and have decided to stop working with Paypal altogether. Terrible customer service (who keep on telling you they will "personally contact you" themselves, which never happened), absolutely not willing to help me get my money that was "lost" (but I\'m pretty sure it\'s still somewhere at Paypal\'s.
