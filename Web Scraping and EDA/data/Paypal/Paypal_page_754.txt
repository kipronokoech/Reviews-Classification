This company's Paypal account was turning over quite a lot of money and had 0 disputes and 5 star rating on Trustpilot, so how such decision was made at Paypal is beyond me. The customer service is also non existent so there is noone to actually discuss this with. They just block your account as and when they want and there is absolutely nothing you can do about it.

Now this was being done for a very small amount of money.. I never asked for any upfront payments, I did exactly as he asked, which was move certain assets around and construct some connection tunnels to the various other parts of the level. I even fixed a bunch of issues I was not meant to fix, as a sign of good will.\n\nSo now it comes down to him testing the file, which was packed using a special program designed to compress all of the materials, brushes, soundscapes, models, triggers and so forth. So there was no, absolutely no possible way this item could have been "broken".\n\nI even witnessed him testing it through remote broadcast after I had tested it myself over 100 times and he proceeded to say he was very happy with the work and also the 50 players on the server were happy and grateful for the work.\n\nI then find out he has not been online for over 7 days, so I decided to check my Paypal. I then found out I had a negative balance, which means this horrible, scamming individual has put a chargeback on my money because it was "missing/broken/not working/not as described"\n\nThe rage that came over me was unfathomable, the fact that I had done all of this work for nothing made me feel like a ticking time bomb. The fact that I had sent a perfectly operational digital product, and then to have everything I\'ve worked for taken away by a terrible company who believes the buyer on a whim.\n\nI could not even process my order to say it was sent to the buyer because this junk website keeps bringing up its one liner "We\'re experiencing technical difficulties" that message was showing for days on end and they are so bloody lucky I never rang customer support about this because they\'d have one of the most abusive truthful calls they\'ve ever gotten.\n\n\nPaypal is committing criminal offences by holding people\'s money indefinitely for no reason, and they also work in the criminals\' favour.
