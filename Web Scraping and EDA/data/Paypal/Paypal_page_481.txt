The jacket was ordered online from a UK address and returned using the QR code provided by the company to an address in the UK. When I opened the dispute, I was asked to return the jacket to an address in Spain (even 'though I have had confirmation several times from Massimo Dutti employees that they did receive the item I posted to the UK). I tried to explain that I could not return an item I no longer had, but Paypal decided to side with the company and declined my refund. I feel this is astoundingly bad service. By the simple expedient of lying about the return, Massimo Dutti has avoided refunding the money they owe me, and Paypal has assisted them in that regard. This has driven a coach and horses through any pretence Paypal has of buyer protection. I no longer regard them as a safe way to carry out financial transactions. I have found it impossible to communicate this to anyone in Paypal, and can only vent my frustration here. What a disappointment.
