By far the worst company I have ever experienced in my life. I will never use them again and strongly advise anyone considering using them to look at the alternatives. Countless money holds that last months, security reviews, big fees, basically any excuse to hold on to your money as long as they can they will. Terrible customer service that feels like they are deliberately trying to annoy you. Finally they awarded a dispute to a buyer who told complete lies about me and my product. I had no idea there was a claim even taking place as I didn’t receive the emails they sent so they automatically refunded the seller over £1300 and allowed him to keep all the stock! They declined my appeal and kept switching me from one customer service representative to the next who just kept repeating the same lines they’ve been trained to over and over like robots. As soon as I found out there was a claim happening I contacted them but they said it was too late…the appeal had been automatically ruled in the buyers favour as I didn’t respond in time. I only found out there was a claim taking place when the £1300+ Was taken out of my account. I’ll never get the money back and a nefarious buyer has benefited from telling lies about me.

PayPal has basically refused to accept the dispute and closed the case, saying it was "not an unauthorized transaction", when the literal definition of "unauthorized" is to do without consent. I cancelled it months ago, signifying they no longer had consent. And in a final email, PayPal told me to settle it with Avast....basically telling me to disappear. Avast had already emailed me back and said "your money should already be back in your account." So, even THEY realize they screwed up. Yet, PayPal still chooses to not help me. I can\'t even send a screenshot to PayPal, because that isn\'t an option in PayPal\'s "available options." "Contact us" only sends me to the "resolution center", which sends me back to the "closed cases", which sends me back to the "contact us" part. It\'s all just a runaround. I sent one last email to PayPal, and if it isn\'t resolved, I\'ll delete my account, and pray my bank will void the transaction and refund my money. Then THEY can deal with PayPal and/or Avast.

Their policy changes too often like 5 times per year making impossible to track any changes to the policy. NEVER EVER USE THEIR SERVICES IF YOU DONT WANT TO BE cheated! Their fraud protection is a joke - you are usually given various excuses that policy do not cover your particular transaction. My recent pay in 3 offer has been repaid only after I paid 5 times so 2 rates worth of money has been taken from my account. They also don't take the money from the account on the promised day so they try to take it next week or two and often occuring the error because at this time there is no longer enough money available on the Bank account, than they charge you a £12 for late payments. Also sometimes the bank is charging for the cancelled transaction . In the effect the promised 17.5% interest rate turning to something rather like £37.5 % or perhaps even more.\nDifficult to use UI make things even worse when in the middle of writing the complaint (they don't provide any way for confirming your request for help regarding unauthorized transactions etc.) I am really happy that finally I have been able to repay all loan + many many more money. Now they can not mess with me because the Loan Account is 0.00 so they can not claim that they are OK when trying to overcharge you with many times disapearing big ammount of one of repayment, when the account is still shows that there is a old value even after the weeks! They are unable to deduct right ammount on their own system? - it should happen immediately! Also recently they provided the bitcoin account, but they not give you any way to pay with the bitcoin - you can only sell and buy the bitcoins and ofcourse there's a fee for each time when you try to replace the bitcoin to the £ pounds sterling!\nI promise myself that I will never get any loan from them and advice you the same if you don't want be angry with disapearing repayment money - do nothing.", 'review_date': '2023-04-13', 'review_time': '12:21:00', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
