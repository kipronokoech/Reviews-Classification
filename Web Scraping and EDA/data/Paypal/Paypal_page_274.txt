By the way, during an online transaction I was prompted to call Paypal, perhaps due to the fact I have not performed Paypal transactions for a long period.\n\nThe support staff asked me to confirm my full name. Though I correctly confirmed my first and last names, I was told that they do not match their records. Worried that my account may have been hacked, I tried several minutes justifying my name with proof. The staff was unable to give me any hints of the failure. Eventually it became evident from past emails that the staff was expecting my title (i.e. “Mr”) to be included when confirming my full name. According to the PayPal staff, the omission of the title (i.e. Mr, Miss, Mrs..) when asked to confirm the full name will constitute a security authentication failure.\n\nThen I was asked for to quote the last 4 digits of my card registered with PayPal. Since I was unsure of the actual card, the support staff want me readout the numbers of all my cards to him. Since some of my past credit cards are no longer with me now and also I wasn’t keen to give details of all my cards to PayPal, I asked the staff whether he could proceed to alternative options/questions instead of the card details. Though, I have setup four security questions/answers initially when opening the PayPal account, the support staff stated that those security questions are only for online support and are useless for telephone support. The staff suggested that I cancel my PayPal account since I can’t remember one particular information.\n\nI then contacted the support team via Facebook Messenger, asking them to comment on my experience with their telephone support team. Though they have appreciated the difficulties, they haven’t confirmed or denied whether their support team have correctly followed the security authentication process.', 'review_date': '2021-09-26', 'review_time': '17:09:53', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

The next month I made sure to keep a eye out on my side it showed I was on auto payment still. So the day after the due date it showed I was late again an my bank didn’t take it out again! So I called and it the man said you have been taken off auto payment since May that’s why it didn’t come out I said I didn’t take it off auto payment I had called last month cause it wasn’t taken out the guy said y’all had a glitch. He said he fixed it put it back on auto payment which has been coming out now regular as it was before hand. Than I seen a icon on the account an said call customer service figured it was about that. It is now sept I seen that it my account said 0.00 meaning they did something to my account not what I owe but remain credit. So I call and it says my account was closed! I talk to the customer service he said it been closed since May when I missed 1 payment in 8 or 9 years an it was late no more than a week maybe! The second time was 1 day! It’s a pandemic as well but I have never not paid them! Anyways the man today said I couldn’t reopen my account I’d have to re apply! This is some bs I have had a few hackers before on PayPal from different countries and different cities! They do not keep a eye out for hackers and do not look out for there customers!
