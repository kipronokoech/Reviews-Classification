Sounds like a lot of money until they take their cut. I get a 5 star review from the buyer, a comment on how the phone is in "excellent" condition and thanking me for getting it to the buyer so fast.\n\nFlash forward to June (6 months later). My used phone stops working and the buyer wants a refund and opens a case with PayPal. I fill out a response and say how does someone expect a 6 month warranty on a 3 year old phone? I also offer her January review of me as a seller as proof the phone was working at the time I shipped it. I don\'t think about it again until four days later (while I\'m on vacation by the way) I get an email from PayPal saying they\'re issuing a full refund to the buyer once she ships the phone back to me "in the condition she received it in." Well that\'s a lie. I sent her a working phone and she\'s returning a broken phone 1/2 a year later. Also, interesting how they want a full refund even though eBay (part of PayPal) took a cut on the sale. Guess they don\'t have to give up their part of the sale even though the buyer gets all her money back. .\n\nI was ultimately able to resolve the issue by calling PayPal and waiting on hold forever and finally talking to someone who agreed that yes a 6 month warranty on a 3 year old phone is ridiculous. They reversed the filing, and released the hold on my money...but why didn\'t that happen before.\n\nThe episode just showed me how sucky their service is. Next time I\'ll just give my phone back to my sucky phone company when it\'s time to upgrade rather than sell it on eBay which is run by sucky PayPal.', 'review_date': '2018-06-27', 'review_time': '18:24:43', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

They are categorically the worst company I have ever dealt with. They have no interest in reason or logic - they act like they own the internet and get to dictate how everyone should be forced to transact.\n\nI don\'t use my paypal account but somehow, a client had the account details from years back and transferred money into the account which was stagnant. I stopped using PayPal for a reason.\n\nPayPal refused to refund the money and refused to even discuss the matter with me because they had limited the account - For no reason whatsoever, after 5 years of limit free trade, all of a sudden THEY had a problem. So, instead of blocking the account, they continue to accept money into, they just wont allow me to refund, withdraw or close the account - this is the dictatorship in online transactions they have created - if you have a limited account, they will accept money into the account on your behalf and hold onto it, but they will not allow any money to leave the account through payments, withdrawals or refunds!!\n\nThe only way I could lift the limitation was to agree to allowing them to share my personal information with Equifax - the company who came to notoriety last year for breaching the privacy of millions of customers details online... no thanks... But bad luck, Paypal have no interest in discussing the matter, every response to every query was " you have a limitation [insert canned response here]"\n\nSo I advised the client - I don\'t accept paypal, you need to pay via the methods provided on the invoice - so they lodged a dispute to get their money back because I was hamstrung to help refund.\n\nI tried to respond to the dispute but PayPal provide 3 response options - none of which were relevant to my situation. So I contact them again and get a standard response "we\'re currently investigating, ..." Then, no further response and they award the dispute, keep the $6 transaction fee and withdraw the full amount from my funds... Goddamn thieves!\n\nThey have no customer service and have no interest in providing a fair and reasonable resolution service.\n\nHow they are allowed to continue operating across the globe is beyond me...
