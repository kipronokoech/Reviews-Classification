For the second time this year Paypal allowed a stolen debit card of mine to be used for fraudulent transactions. One time is understandable, but twice is either negligence or policy. I was notified by my bank on 9/25/2018 that my card was used via paypal twice for $100 each. There were several more attempts made but they were able to block the use of the card. I contacted paypal regarding the issue and they claimed the card was swiped in cleveland ohio for the transactions and they would not refund the charges. I was not in cleveland ohio on the 25th and have not been there for over 20 years and the card was never out of my possession. They basically said I was lying and they would not do anything about the charges. Like I stated above back in January of this year they stole $1300 from me and took over 2 weeks to give it back. Since I dont have a paypal account they were more worried about their customer being upset than the money they stole from me. Again, I have the card, it nor I was ever in cleveland. They continue to show that they make money off of the fraudulent charges and they dont care that non customer victims are being screwed by their incompetence.
