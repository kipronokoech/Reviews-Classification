Because apparently on the tracking information it being left in a bin is acceptable as proof of delivery. I had over 2 weeks going back and forth and they would not reopen the case! The courier admitted liability and provided me with an email admitting that it was their fault, admitted they email could be as proof as non delivery and an incident reference number provided. PayPal still would not accept this, was not interested in even seeing it! Said they wouldn’t accept that as evidence as non delivery.\nThe only option I was left with was to dispute the payment with my bank and hope that they will deal accordingly on my behalf.\nI have since cancelled my PayPal account, as there is no protection for buyers in this instance, if a parcel is delivered insecurely. Therefore there is no buyer protection.

Customer Facing and Transparent\n2. Business facing and Conceited\n\nPaypal definitely falls into the latter.\n\nAs an avid eBay user (buyer and seller) and online purchaser I have used Paypal regularly for a great number years and in that time I've experienced their lack of customer care many times.\n\nMost recently Paypal, in their 'wisdom' decided to remove my bank account from my Paypal account which meant an automatic payment failed to be taken by a company that led to financial implications for me. Paypal did email within a couple days of removing the account (not that this help me as I wasn't around to pick up emails at the time) and they stated that the reason they had removed my bank account was due to it already being 'closed' - which is absolute nonsense. I double checked all the details and everything had been correct (account numbers/sort code etc.) And, in any case, it's the bank account I had used with Paypal many times over the past few years without issue and which remains open with a healthy balance.\n\nI have attempted to contact Paypal by email (due to trouble using the phone) for a number of days now in order to understand the reason behind their decision. I received an automated response on the first day that supplied information that was completely unrelated to my issue, and so I continued to email Paypal in the attempt at receiving a reply - without any success.\n\nPaypal provides a service that's good when it works but offers little personally focused support when things go wrong. They provide a service that millions use and benefit from everyday, so sharing this account of Paypal's very poor customer service will likely have no impact on the business at all, but it just felt right to highlight the companies failing nature.", 'review_date': '2018-03-07', 'review_time': '10:24:31', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
