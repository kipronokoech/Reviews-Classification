The website is extremely slow, first of all. There are all kinds of poorly designed logistical issues that can make it really hard to maintain access to your account.

If you dont have access to that, you are already locked out of your account. There are also other really annoying things like if you make a business account with your email, you can't make a personal account with that email too. It's also too hard to delete the business account after making it. It is not conveniently designed at all.
