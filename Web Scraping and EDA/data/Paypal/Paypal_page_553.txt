I never heard from the merchant and never received any merchandise. Paypal sent me a UPS tracking #. When I googled the number it was obviously bogus. It was in my town, but was a commercial establishment with a loading dock and a receiving employee, and was not my private home. The date was wrong, also. I let Paypal know, and they responded that the merchandise had been delivered, and thus the charge was valid. I asked Paypal to google the tracking #, but apparently they did not. I had thought that paying through Paypal would protect me from fraud, but it did not. I lodged a claim with my Visa card, through which I had paid Paypal. Visa researched my claim and ruled that I was correct. Visa gave me a refund.', 'review_date': '2020-07-17', 'review_time': '20:46:32', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
