I ordered a tibeten rainbow cat cave from a website. I read the reviews and has its with Paypal so I went ahead to order. Eventually I received a cat cave from China that had been made with childs felt it was nothing like the one I wanted and its absolutely horrible it's so cheap it flops over and its very small. It's black with a stuck on face ears and tail. I emailed the company but nothing. And I received an email of my email provider saying this email address does not appear to be legitimate and there's no mail box for guidesky12n my original dispute with al I sent photos of the original order purchased and what I actually received. I googled Guidesky125 and also mentioned to PayPal Guidesky125 come up on the Web has a scam. Also endless PayPal customers like myself. Instead of receiving a full refund like most people who get sold aload of cheap rubbish. My case was closed. PayPal knew all along and even before I went ahead and purchased the item that Guidesky125 were an illegal website who have actually been reported to PayPal on multiple occasions. So get this PayPal were fully aware of Guidesky125 way before myself and let me go ahead and by the time I had contacted PayPal to open dispute for a full refund they close it down and decided they were not going to pay me. PayPal had no intention of helping me myself whatsoever. They ley criminals like Guidesky125 sell using them so nice genuine people like myself can be taken for a ride to hell. I feel totally let down by the due paypal and Guidesky125 has paypal should be more reasonable after all by the time they got my order they already knew of Guidesky125 has they have had many and multiple customers like myself who have been ripped off. So PayPal knowingly let Guidesky125use PayPal this is showing that they knowingly let me order and purchase through there website only to find out they knew all along I had purchased off a know scam to PayPal so now I'm so disappointed sad and feel like PayPal are letting Guidesky125 both usedme to gain. My cat will never fit in her awful cheap scruffy cave and anyone else looking for a cat cave beware of the sellers website. They use genuine cat cave.com pictures and reviews. It's absolutely shocking how PayPal can get away with this and wiggle out of a dispute when they have known all along who Guidesky125 are and should of at least stopped the purchase or refund the money back instead of trading me for a scam called Guidesky125", 'review_date': '2020-11-10', 'review_time': '08:01:51', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

Paypal have received many complaints about this company but still endorsed payment by paypal. I was given the tracking number and a link which didn't work.

Put a complaint into Paypal who took it up but today i received a reply saying that peekachill had supplied evidence that it had been delivered at 15:33 on 10 October. I even checked my CCTV on the day it was allegedly delivered, and guess what, nothing. Considering on 19 October they provided the 2nd link it's strange that it was delivered some 9 days earlier. The first link can still not find the package. Normal shipping from China is 4 weeks, mine was apparently in the UK in 8 days. Paypal don't want to know. Told me to take it up with Royal Mail and request a letter from them confirming it hasn't been delivered. I have already sent paypal evidence that the tracking number does not exist on the Royal Mail website, so how i can request a letter for something that doesn't exist. Fortunately i have a credit account with Paypal so actually owe them money. They have been informed if this is not resolved that i will pay off the credit account minus the money that their guarantee will not cover.
