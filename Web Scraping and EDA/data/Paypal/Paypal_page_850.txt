I sell on eBay for a living and dealing with PayPal is the worst experience I have ever had. I've be doing this for 2+ years and have never had a problem until this year. In the last two months they have held money from 5 sales that were made on my account. When I call each time about this -they state that they will release the funds 3 days after my customer has received the purchase. The problem I have with this is I need the money for shipping since I pay all the shipping cost out of my pocket. In addition, I have a 100% positive rating with eBay from my customers and I always handle issues that arise in a timely manner and ship out most purchase within 3 business days. I run a successful business but feel mistreated by PayPal. I have done nothing wrong yet they continue to hold the money that was paid to me for a product that I own, listed and have to ship. I truly hope eBay will encourage other companies besides PayPal to handle the sales transactions. PayPal is a disgrace and I feel there is no protection for me or my company with PayPal since they are a monopoly and they know it.", 'review_date': '2017-05-11', 'review_time': '02:25:37', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

They seam to justify this by the unstable fluctuating currency changes , but someone could get very rich by doing this, some are doing business profiting only using that magnitude of exchange rate..\n\n2-You can get blocked overnight and they will never care who you are or what you are doing, If they request a document , they accept it or reject it, no clarification whatsoever. Most of the process of blocking you is automatic , no one really care about your time.\nIf there is a problem, you just wait at their own discretion, after some days or weeks they could restore your account and thanks you making PayPal the most secure service.\nI did not want to get blocked suddenly so i quit their service and for ever.', 'review_date': '2017-05-08', 'review_time': '05:12:30', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
