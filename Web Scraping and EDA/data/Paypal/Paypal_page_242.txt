So tell me why PayPal says I’m not eligible for a refund of an item I didn’t purchase under their “protection” program? Someone else hacked my PayPal and did a fraudulent transaction. I contacted PayPal and they said they couldn’t dispute this transaction because it was a service I signed up for in an agreement with the merchant?! Wow. Anyway, the only thing that saved me was that the idiot used my bank card to make the purchase so I was able to ask my bank to have it reversed. My bank believed me unlike PayPal who is probably owned by Mark Zuckerberg now. But wait! There’s more! Two days later I get a refund from the MERCHANT onto my PayPal because I had contacted them as well. I told them I did not make the purchase. They gave me my money back and worked with my bank. Then as soon as the money says refunded on my PayPal, I get an email from PayPal stating that I’ve been committing fraud on my account and they want to lock my account and verify my identity. Where the heck were they when someone did hack my account?!

I bought a scarf online through BUYERS PROTECTION on depop! The description came as,\nFendi scarf\nwidth 13.5”\nLength 66”\nMinor cut on scarf shown in photos\nIt then had 4 photos of the scarf looking pristine with no damage accept a close up clear image of the cut in the scarf.\n\nSo i bought it, the item arrives. And there is damage on the end which isn’t so repairable as the simple straight minor cut it had, its more of a ripped hole on the end right on the tip about half an inch across and very easily seen and noticeable. Its clearly hidden up on the other side of the scarf so its not visible whatsoever in the photos.\n\nI lost the case because “i knew it was damaged” I said i bought a second hand fendi scarf in good condition with just a minor cut in it. I expected to receive just what i paid for. He said no its not significantly not as described because “i knew it was damaged and i should expect more damage if it has any damage on it, purely because it's second hand” I’m don’t know about you but it seems to me some of these paypal reps have no idea how to do their job he’s arguing with me its black when its white.\n\nI explained this, if you buy a car from the dealership for a slightly cheaper price because its got a scratch on the door and you drive 2 miles down the road and the clutch dies out and the brakes are failing, you would take it back and ask for your money back!\nApparently though I wouldn’t. Apparently because i know it was damaged (because it has a scratch on the door) i should expect it to be damaged anyway elsewhere on the car and i wouldn't have a right to my money.\n\nAnyone with half a brain can understand this i don’t know why this guy zolandoro or whatever his name is is even working there he needs to get a new job he doesn't know the difference between black and white he doesn’t know the difference between buying an item that says it has a minor cut in it and buying an item thats described as damage. He’s telling me they are the same thing which means i should expect damage and whatever it was and its not as described. I also asked to speak to a manager or someone higher up and he said there is no one who can, he said he spoke to a colleague and the colleague agreed with him, i asked to speak to the colleague and he said he can’t put me through to anyone else. Absolutely bs i don’t think i can ever trust paypal for payments ever again, will look elsewhere for other platforms similar but with better reviews.", 'review_date': '2021-12-23', 'review_time': '12:29:31', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

Firstly, their buyer protection plan means screw over the supplier in all instances. If a buyer complains about anything, then the buyer gets a full refund from the supplier no matter how outrageous or ridiculous the claim. When I called Paypal about it, they gave me this fake script about how they balance each refund on its merits and try to ensure that everyone is carefully and fairly compensated. The problem is that there is NEVER balance and is 100% ALWAYS against the seller. Then to just kick you in the teeth, Paypal adds an additional resolution fee for having to intervene and screw you over. They are the worst company that I have ever had to deal with and their poor customer service is 100% useless. I actually feel a bit sorry for their customer service because they need to respond to the outrageous behaviours of a tyrannical, bullying company.
