Recently I sold bitcoin on coinbase to help my mother in law who has cancer for medical bills and help with funeral cost of her daughter who passed away recently. Coinbase deposited about 21 k dollars in my paypal account. I was not able to send entire balance to my wife paypal account due to transaction limitations which they do not make it clear what the limit is. Only you will receive a message that the amount you are sending is above limit and can not be sent.\n\nI tried to send smaller amounts over several days to my wife paypal account and that has caused her account and my account to get suspended for suspicious activity. I tried to call customer service, and the wait time was over two hours each time we tried to call them, and sometime the phone would just disconnect after waiting several hours, so sometime we end up spending over four hours per day waiting on hold just to speak to someone rude who does not want to help or can not help with anything. They tell you to submit all kind of personal information such as bank statements, government ID, and other proof documents. Even after submitting what they request from us they continue to block our accounts for 180 days, by that time my mother in law will be dead for not receiving medical treatment on time.\n\nWe even offered paypal that we provide marriage certificate as proof to show the money was only sent to my wife account and clarify our sending activity was not suspicious and legitimate. My wife account was closed for life and she was not able to receive the money I sent her. Soon my mother in law will be dead because of their actions. We even offered paypal to show medical proof for the use of money and show death certificate of my sister in law, nothing helped. The staff you talk to on the phone are useless as they can only tell you that they will forward your case to another department for review then nothing happens. Now I can say bye to my 21 k dollars that was held hostage with paypal.\n\nThey stole all my money. If I knew this would happen to me I would have avoided paypal. I should have used an exchange to take out my money instead of paypal. I will never again use their services nor recommend their services to anyone. I hope they go bankrupt and no one ever use their services. I am not able to send text messages to paypal because everything I send to them by text gets ignored and I dont think I want to wait another four hours per day just to speak to a robot who can not help me with anything, so my money is definitely gone.', 'review_date': '2021-04-20', 'review_time': '05:40:47', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

It took the better part of 2 months for paypal to refund me, including needing to go into town into a post office during high covid season and pay £9+ to send that scrap of cloth back to china recorded delivery. Hours and hours of my time wasted as paypal kept giving the scammer (who had been reported multiple times, had multiple scam alerts on review sites like this that had popped up since I bought there- many of whom said paypal had immediately refunded THEM- so paypal knew it was a scam website).\nThen as revenge a few weeks later the scammer used a different email paypal to send me £0.50, of which I recieved £0.18 as paypal took the rest as 'fees', then immediately claimed I hadn't sent anything. I don't sell ANYTHING in any way, on any website and have never used paypal as a seller. I wrote to paypal multiple times to explain this, they ignored all my messages, replied to none, and took the full £0.50 from my account and sent it to the scammer. This little act of petty revenge and subsequent theft by paypal after having ignored every attempt to get them to listen allowed the scammer to get a petty act of revenge. It makes me their victim again, and more hours of my time needing to be wasted to try and reverse it. Made worse by paypal (despite being a world wide organisation) only allowing human help desk contact during short UK business hours, there's no ability to talk in chat/phone/email outside of this time.\nPaypal was absolutely useless and has stolen from me, never engaged at all or listened at all.
