Rightfully the money should have never been taken once the cancellation and refund were given back, but they took it a day later. I even got an email from PayPal stating that I was refunded, a day before the money was taken out of my bank account. I am not clear on why this happened as it did or why it takes a week to get the refund. I would suggest to anyone to find some other cash app to work with since this has resulted in a few overdraft charges charges on me. If I hadn’t received the email about the refund on the 5th, this would not be an issue. You are better off finding a good cash app to work with.
