Be afraid, be very afraid!) they take a massive fee from your transactions and they do nothing in return.

As proof of this theft, I sent 14 screen grabs and jpegs of receipts, and e-mail transactions, plus a written explanation of each piece of evidence proving that this person ordered the entertainment, and that the entertainment went down as planned. PayPal claimed that they forwarded this evidence to the buyers financial institution, but I have my doubts. I'll never know if they did or not. This customer's financial institution ruled in favor of this buyer's fraudulent action and awarded him his full refund. PayPal did next to nothing to help me, support me or fight the charge although they say they believed I was a victim of fraud and theft of services. PayPal removed money from my account and paid the criminal. This criminal customer got away with stealing from me and as a middle person, PayPal did nothing to help me fight it. Over the past 10 years I've paid PayPal hundred's dollars in fees for their service, but they let me down by acquiescing with this con artist and fraudulent customer.
