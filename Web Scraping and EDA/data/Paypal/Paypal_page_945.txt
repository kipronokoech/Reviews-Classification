However, I have heard that there have been breeches in security, certain accounts being compromised, and that somewhat concerns me. I understand that 100% security is probably impossible these days, but I still think PayPal could put up better shields against hackers. Also it is very difficult to collect under their guarantees. They tried to stonewall me on a valid claim I had and I had to threaten to sue one time before they would pay. Then, even though I was entitled, they said they paid me as a favor because I was a good customer. I was very negalively impressed. So as long as there are no wrinkles, they are great. But watch out about if you ever have to collect under one of their insurances or guarantees.
