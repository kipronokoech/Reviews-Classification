Surely if PayPal cared they would have looked into the matter further and would have seen the change which they clearly did not do.

Paypal\'s "seller protection" is one of the greatest works of fiction ever written, exceeding even the works of some of the greatest fairy tales ever told. And if you don\'t believe me then answer me this: How is a seller protected from predatory buyers with a Paypal policy that ensures and guarantees that all a buyer has to do to receive a refund is to claim that an item that he or she received is "significantly different from how it was described"? For example: I recently sold an over $500 tablet to an individual who, after receiving the item, opened up a case against me and claimed that he did not receive the tablet. Do I even need to tell you the outcome? Do I even need to tell you that this individual was somehow able to "prove" beyond a shadow of a doubt that the item that he ordered from me was not in the box that tracking shows that he received and signed for? Now that must have been really hard to do. Dare I say that our great protectors at Paypal must have believed that it was impossible to remove the item and take a picture of nothing, which apparently is all that is needed to convince the wonderful intelligent "agents" that a guy who has been using them for years without any such problems is now guilty of sending a customer a box with nothing.\n\nSo here I am crying with everyone else who is on this little platform hoping that it will make a difference. Because as small sellers, we can\'t afford to constantly lose $550 that we wrongfully and foolishly believed that Paypal was there to protect us from losing.\n\nFinally, what are we to do? Well, with Paypal being an institution of such great size and might, it seems that the only thing that little guys like us can do is to increase the amount of vaseline. I hope everyone has a great dental plan.', 'review_date': '2017-08-28', 'review_time': '02:07:01', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

Previous purchases using PayPal have been without issue, that is to say the one time we had to use PayPal "dispute" process.......One month + one week ago my wife ordered a "Aubrey Wavy Short Wigs" from NextWigs. After some time we queried about when she\'d get it. An email said each was "custom made" after receiving the order. When it finally arrived (following is what I told PayPal) " Item received is all straight, Bangs are 3" (1"/25% LESS than stated), Nape is 2.5" (1"/66.6% MORE than stated) and Crown is 4" (1"/20% LESS than stated). The website indicates that the coloring may be "slightly different" due to computer monitors. Both my wife and a lady friend state the color is "a lot different" and not wavy and not appropriate for my wife." We disputed the $86 CC charge ($10-shipping) through PayPal. The "seller" offered to refund $40 and we keep the item. Refused. PayPal eventually agreed with the "seller" that we had to return it to China to receive credit of our $86. The package we received the item from has a return address of Jamacia, NY. USPS from MT indicates $9.95 to send it to NY and >$40 to send to China address. We\'re out $86 after PayPal refused to have us send it to NY at our own expense (our total loss would have been the $9.95 for an item that was NOT as described or shown on multiple aspects). I googled Aubrey Wavy Short Wigs and at least six sites came up with the same picture and description. IMO, the return must go to the "manufacturer" rather than the PayPal "seller".

Sorry Neil, you\'re certainly NOT my daddy and your warning is why I am writing this review. Not to mention I STILL don\'t have my funds that I worked for. Neil and Mike both directed me to go back and forth between my mobile and my phone browser over and over, WHY IS THEIR WEBSITE NOT FULLY RESPONSIVE???, and both directed me to different tabs that were incorrect. Mike told me to go to a certain place to refund something and there was no option due to a bug (figures). Then Neil told me he would close down my account as I asked him to do so and he said it would "take a long time" since there was a measly $1.50 that I said they could donate and he refused to keep my on hold on the line when he was doing this.
