Recently used them on two Ebay purchases as I thought it gave me protection against being scammed on Ebay. Turns out using my credit card will be just as easy and has more protection as my credit cards have people who answer the phone and will stop payments when I get scammed. Paypal has no one answering the phone and that makes it very difficult to communicate and try to get my money back. Luckily it was not a lot of money, BUT I recently lost $300 on VENMO,which Paypal owns and they have the TERRIBLE.......NO PHONE SERVICE and no TRANSPARENCY WHEN MAKING DECISIONS.\nSTAY AWAY FORM BOTH PAYPAL AND VENMO.
