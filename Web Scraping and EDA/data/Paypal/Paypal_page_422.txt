I have had a PayPal account for 1 month for a purchase I made on eBay. 3 weeks later I receive an email that someone is logging into my account from an unrecognized device and that same day another email with the receipt from an authorized transaction which I did not make to some trashy clothing company for hundreds of dollars. Rather than make it possible to speak to someone about the issue I had to go through the ridiculously time-consuming dispute process only to be denied moments later. I then waited on hold for an ENTIRE day to speak to someone who was very nice but not helpful in the least. She told me that PayPal never sent an email to me about someone logging into my account from another device. When I insisted she finally “found” that email. She filed an appeal for my case and said it would take up to 9 business days for a resolution. The next day I received noticed that my case was closed and that PayPal determined that this purchase was indeed authorized. Interesting. Despite the fact that they sent me an email of someone else potentially logging into my account, and then the actual account holder contacting PayPal on the same day of the transaction to say it was fraudulent. Not sure how they came to that conclusion but perhaps it is an automated “team” “resolving” these issues. Fine. Whatever. I decide to close my PayPal account due to this experience. Instead, PayPal puts limitations on my account which disallows me from sending or receiving money and closing my account. I have to upload pictures of my drivers license, passport and debit cards in order to confirm that it’s me and wait for someone to review my information before they will lift the limitations enabling me to close my account. Are you kidding? I am being asked to upload MORE private information to this sketchy, hackable, fraudulent, dumpster fire of a company? Still to be resolved as I have not been able to speak to an actual human.

Paypal refunded my payment to the buyer with no further request to send the item back to me and more over it charged me £14 of chargeback fees.

But £14 chargeback was. What a joke! Awful customer support and awful seller protection. Its LOOSE LOOSE LOOSE situation for me and paypal doesn’t care about it. I don’t have my item back, paypal refunded payment in full and paypal charged me £14 on top of it. Poor disgusting service.
