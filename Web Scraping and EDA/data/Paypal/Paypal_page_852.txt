After many attempts and searches online, I still haven't found a way to transfer that balance out of my account. Each time I try to do that, I get a message telling me to try again at a later time. Not only that, but also, for some reason PayPal doesn't actually let you use your balance before charging your debit card while paying online, despite them saying so. It is unacceptable for a company dealing with vast amounts of money to have problems of this sort. Utterly disappointed.\n\n\nEdit: As of recently, I have spoken with an employee and they have solved my problem (turns out they had to exchange my currencies) and I was able to withdraw my money.
