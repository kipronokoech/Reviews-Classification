It is despicable for a business that is trusted to manage financial transactions is not allowing customers to access their own accounts. I cannot make any transactions as it will not allow you to log in, even if you get as far as putting in your password and back to security verify prompts. They cannot do this forever and as soon as Paypal lets me in, I will delete my account. What is the purpose of Paypal if you cannot pay sellers? They have a lot of bad publicity and people are deleting their accounts en masse and they have now made a bad situation worse, by not allowing customers to do Any transactions.
