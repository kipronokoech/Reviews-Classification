So, they asked me to provide some photo ID and proof of address which is fair enough, so I sent in my photo ID and that was fine, but they kept saying the proof of address was wrong. So i sent in a different document with my address on, they said it had to be issued within the last year so i sent in my driving licence with my address on, then they changed the criteria and said if it was a driving licence as evidence of address it had to be accompanied by another government issued document like a payslip, so i sent that in also and then they changed again and sent me that back saying it now has to be a passport with the driving licence. I have currently sent in my documents 5 times now and still my account is frozen with my money in and i have no way of getting to it, shocking experience i think i will be closing my account down after this.', 'review_date': '2016-12-15', 'review_time': '12:00:04', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
