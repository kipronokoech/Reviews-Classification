Sent a message online which took 3 days to review asking to stop payment as when I tried stopping payment on their website it gave me an error "Cannot process your request at this time". The message said the payment was "pending" and their was nothing I could do as the seller has not accepted the payment.

I updated my message to include this Paypal user has a long history of defrauding buyers.\nThe reply came 3 days later saying the payment was accepted and now I can file a dispute. Within 2 days of filing, the seller sends an EMPTY UPS ENVELOPE to my house (meanwhile, I paid for a WEIGHT BENCH).

The most recent issue is what led me to leave this review. Here\'s the situation:\n\nI purchased a mini printer for $19.98 from a manufacturer in China. Three weeks after I received my order confirmation email (from both the seller\'s website and PayPal), I didn\'t receive a tracking number nor had any updates on my order.\n\nI contacted PayPal and they sent a message to the seller on my behalf. I originally requested to cancel the order and get a refund, thinking the seller just had no intention of shipping my item, but then they replied with a legit tracking number.\n\nThat was good enough for me, so the case was closed. My "Item Not Received" concern was solved (because the seller had provided me proof that the item is on its way).\n\nFast-forward a few more weeks and my item arrived! Guess what? It wasn\'t the mini printer. It was a cheap little, plastic "water pipe" toy for children. I wouldn\'t have even bought it.\n\nObviously, I was mad with the seller.\n\nI contacted PayPal to inform them of the problem and file a "significantly not as described" dispute.\n\nThe response? Three different PayPal agents told me the same thing:\n\n"I have reviewed the transaction and see that the case is already resolved." [paraphrased]\n\nI\'ve been told to work it out with the seller, which we all know is not going to get resolved. I\'m out of $19.98 because PayPal refuses to do anything. It\'s clear you can\'t trust PayPal to protect your finances or have your back when you\'ve been wronged by a seller.\n\nand for the record, I didn\'t find anything in their policies that said a buyer can\'t open a second dispute involving the same single transaction. Does it even make sense to disallow that? I don\'t think so; one issue gets solved, so suddenly every other issue with that transaction is irrelevant?
