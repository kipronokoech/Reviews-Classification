For a global company, their business practices are less than professional, and that\'s being kind. Our small business was using them to receive payment from a company in Germany. We have a business account, and our company owner also had a personal account, for personal purchases. PayPal decided that because there were 2 accounts, they would freeze both and they have now held over $18,000 USD since September 2020 (it is now Feb 2021). With COVID rampaging around the world, one would think they wouldn\'t withhold legitimate funds from a struggling small business, BUT THEY HAVE. They hid behind some change in the user agreement, insisting that even though we spent over 2 months proving time and time again that we are who we say we are, and that it shouldn\'t be a reason to lock an account simply for having a personal and a business account, they will still be holding these much needed funds for 6 MONTHS. We are STILL waiting for those funds, set to be released April 18, but with the pandemic not slowing down, we have now gone bankrupt. Paypal feels justified and will actually get rude with you, the client, for even attempting to circumvent this "user agreement" that they continuously adjust and change. Their "customer service" is random people in Africa, Nigeria, India that ADD YOU ON FACEBOOK and "like" your personal pictures and will only talk to you through facebook messenger. Once they have said whatever they need to to stall longer, they then block you. They will ask you to provide the same "proof" over and over again, add nauseum. The Customer Service agents keep changing, so there\'s zero continuity and you constantly have to repeat the same steps repeatedly.
