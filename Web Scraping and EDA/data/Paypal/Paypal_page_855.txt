Then, when I tried to make a payment, using my PayPal balance, through a site that readily accepts PayPal, it not only didn\'t go through, but when I called customer support again, they asked me to verify my identity. (That\'s a good thing.) But, the questions they asked we found from public records. Now, I was asked a question about my half-brother\'s wife. Simply because she shares my last name. Now, I have no idea really, ANYTHING about her. Anyway, after some other security questions, I was confirmed. But, they told me that the attempted purchase, didn\'t even show up! So, I tried to make the purchase, through a different merchant. (Who also accepts PayPal.) This purchase STILL did not go through. It showed up for more than I was trying to spend, too!! So, I attempted to put through another, smaller, purchase, with the customer service rep on the phone, and the website kept bouncing me to an, "enter credit card information," screen. The representative was unable to solve the problem, and I couldn\'t make, what was supposed to be an easy, online purchase. I do not have a valid credit card. And even after verifying my bank account, I was STILL unable to spend my PayPal balance. If I HAD a credit card, I wouldn\'t have been trying to use this service in the first place!!

Had to contact buyer as street and postcode didn\'t match; eventually I was able to ship (yes, alarm bells should have gone off). Some time later buyer opens a case with PayPal (not Ebay first!?), stating \'incomplete item\'. I offer to pay for screws they claim are missing but I don\'t accept returns. Regardless, PayPal witholds my funds until buyer returns item. Buyer does not do so and case is closed. Buyer appeals and reopens case. Buyer changes story to item is damaged beyond use but will accept £50 refund (they paid 70 originally but wanted it for 20...hhmmmm...). They even tell Paypal I agreed! Again, Paypal close case as I don\'t agree to partial refund and buyer still does not return as PayPal instructed them to do. All this goes on 2 months and I\'m getting abusive and aggressive texts and calls from the buyer and his wife (mostly when they are drunk - never giving my number out again). Eventually, after a call informing me I better refund them or they will defacate on it before shipping it back, I call paypal again and they tell me the drunks have appealed 4 times! They promise me that they cannot appeal again as they are abusing the system. I breathe a sigh of relief and move on. Until.....\nI get a courier notification that the item is being returned. As PayPal have told me they have washed their hands of it I\'m not worried. However, it\'s a bit quiet from the buyer\'s end. No illiterate messages. Doesnt \'feel\' right.\nI check my PayPal account and it shows that something is \'unresolved\', yet it shows case is closed. I\'m not too concerned as PayPal would have contacted me if there was an issue right? WRONG! I notice a comment at the top informing me that I need to contact the buyer to have my funds returned to me. Confused, I call Paypal for reassurance:\n\nPayPal have indeed refunded the buyer! Despite their promise, they gave the buyer another chance (I believe she said it was the 7th appeal!) and this time they have actually provided tracking info. However, I have not been in to accept delivery and so the parcel is 40 miles away at a depot that I cannot reach (don\'t drive). Paypal know all this but have refunded anyway.\n\nThis leaves several unanswered questions:\n1. Why was I never informed of ANY of the appeals? - I found out about the first 2 from drunken buyer.\n2. How can Paypal have an appeal open without both parties being informed and given the option to act? - there is nothing on the notes my end except for \'email to buyer\' after case originally closed - they havn\'t even logged my calls (it just shows their end). Apparently last appeal was opened because the lying buyer informed them that they had been in touch with me on \'another platform\' (must have been 9 3/4 as it was complete fiction) and agreed to it - why didn\'t they seek confirmation from me?\n3. How can PayPal just remove funds from my bank (Paypal account was at 0) and not mention it either before or after doing so?\n4. Why are they telling me how to operate a returns service two months after sale despite my opinion on the matter?\n\nToday: when I called in, the first person confirmed all their failures and their theft of my money (when they have not followed their own rules, what else is it?). She then transferred me to a manager \'Laura/Lauren\'? Anyway, she also confirmed that PayPal had not followed it\'s own procedures; she could see the buyer had abused the system; she could see I hadn\'t been contacted about the appeals or refund. She said it was all wrong and \'shouldn\'t have happened\', but could offer me no advice other than to accept the return and appeal myself if it\'s not as I sent it out!\nShe could provide no help or explanation and when I kept trying to ask her, rather than keep letting her spout the same useless confirmation of their failures, she told me she would not continue with the call if I didn\'t stop interrupting. So they steal my money, but can\'t explain themselves and won\'t even attempt to resolve the issue unless I treat them with deference? What was the point of her?\nThis matter is unresolved and I will be looking into a different way of accepting payment other than via PayPal. What I am left wondering though is what legal ramifications arise from PayPal\'s enforcement of their policies on sellers when you consider laws relating to "Restriction of trade", which states: "it is the privilege of a trader in a free country, in all matters not contrary to law, to regulate his own mode of carrying it on according to his own discretion and choice.....but no power short of the general law ought to restrain his free discretion."
