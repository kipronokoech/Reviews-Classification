Spend hours trying to make the payment and unblock all the blocks they made for no reason. Also, they wanted acces to all my financials for it so I deleted it afterwards, without having the tickets, of course.\nSecond, I needed the account for a refund from a seller in China so I made it again. They LIMITED (understand blocked) my account for "strange activity", which was supposed to be ONE payment of not even 200 USD and also put the payment on HOLD! Still waiting FOR DAYS to receive the money...\nNot mentioning they took about 5% for the transfer.\nJust, WOW!\nPS: I tried to call to the customer line sevice and it got picked up. I waited for TWO MINUTES in hopes someone would talk to me. Then I hung up and tried again. This time someone with terrible accent talked to me and put me on hold for another two minutes. So, for these two calls when I listened to a dump happy-like sound, I paid about 5USD! for that.\nAnd of course, the problem did not get resolved.

Having received a message to my phone indicating that £215 has been paid to a company that I did not authorize I was obviously worried. I then discovered that this was on my inactive authorized account list but still the money was sent by paypal. I called paypal and they said that only the vendor could stop reoccurring payments leaving my account annually even though the vendor (having spoken to them did not request payment!). Honestly the 1st person at paypal just left me on hold for 20 minutes and eventually the line went dead. The second person that I spoke with suggested that it was my fault. I can\'t believe that a company of this size can get away with treating customers like dirt and never even offer an apology. In fact all that it would have taken is for someone to say that their was obviously a computer error, but actually the attitude of both of the "customer service agents" was rude, unhelpful and obnoxious. If their was ever a candidate for the worst customer service offering this company would win hands down - they are absolutely shocking bad.', 'review_date': '2018-07-26', 'review_time': '17:46:56', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

A year or two went by and I was hacked by someone. I called PayPal within minutes and by then the hacker had changed literally everything on my account. They asked for my card number I used on my last transaction before the hacking took place but by that time I had already received a new card from my bank for the same reason. And like I said the hacker changed everything so they had to use sercurity questions like “Where out of these three places have you not lived?” “Which of these three cars have you not owned?” After that I had finally gained access to my account and changed everything back along with added every security step possible for it to not happen again. I also took off any bank or card information. Days had gone by and I received emails saying the hack was deemed a fruad. Then after awhile I received emails saying I owed the money the hacker stole from someone else’s account. I at first ignored the first warning thinking it was automatic. Then the second came so I called them. PayPal decided, AFTER emailing me saying the account was hacked, that it was in fact not hacked without emailing me. They let the funds someone was trying to steal through and are now asking for me to pay for the money. At first I wondered how the hacker could have taken that money almost a week later. His number was still set in a part of my account that I didn’t see until just a few days ago. You’d think that customer service would have helped wipe the account of any recent changed information, that they would have saw the transaction occur from someplace other than where I’m from, that they would have thought hmmm neither bank account name and card holder is the person on this account, etc. But back to me calling them, they tried collecting the “debt” then transferred me to someone who put me on hold for an hour and a half and then the call just HUNG UP! Then I received a letter from the debt collectors themselves and called them. I told them about the whole situation and they couldn’t believe PayPal would just let that happen. They said they would send the debt collection back to PayPal since this wasn’t my debt nor have I had fraud issues like this before. Just the occasional debt card replacement because someone hacked something and the bank just wanted to protect every possible persons card number who could have got out, but that’s it. So PayPal opened a new case with my account a few days later and in the comments from the person who wrote it, it says “B****” when talking about me. Like seriously?! I have spoken with my lawyer about the whole thing, sent her pictures but I don’t think it’s a big enough issue for a lawsuit (it is over a few $100) so then I looked into small claims court. Something needs to be done and they can’t treat people like this. I will not stop until this is resolved so I can solve my account and never look back.', 'review_date': '2018-07-25', 'review_time': '08:12:52', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
