They were also able to add an email address to my account. I got an email fro PayPal asking if it was me that did that. I clicked "no" and logged in. It would not let me remove the email address from my own account! Then I found out I had a negative balance all of a sudden. When I called, I could not get a hold of a human person for the longest time. Then, when I did, they patched me over to another company to take care of my "balance." It would not let me close my PayPal account without paying off my balance first. They told me to wait a few days and I should be able to get back on there and close my account. When I got back on there a few days later, there was ANOTHER negative balance of $108! I paid it off and closed my account just so I wouldn\'t have to deal with them again. I HIGHLY recommend that if you have a PayPal account, CLOSE IT. And if you don\'t have one, DON\'T GET ONE.', 'review_date': '2020-05-27', 'review_time': '04:38:55', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

FedEx mis-delivered the package, we did not receive it but FedEx showed a delivered, "left near front door" We did not receive the package and since we have surveillance cameras facing the street and another on our front door, we could see if it was delivered and possible taken. No FedEx vehicle was seen at or near our house on the afternoon the show as delivered, in addition, the front door camera showed no package was left near the door. Sprinkler Warehouse dismissed our issue, first saying wait a day or two, fedex sometimes reports as delivered but does not deliver for a day or two after. Yeah, right. Sprinkler Warehouse did not respond to any email message they were sent, and their customer service does not follow up. I had to always call and go through the issue from the beginning. I called again after a few days to report the package still has not been received, was told they would issue a trace. Weeks went by and no response was received. Called again and was told FedEx showed the package a delivered, and was kind of blown off. Now with the ground work laid, PayPal is suppose to help buyers, so we created a dispute. PayPal shares my information about the dispute with Sprinkler Warehouse, or at least displays this message on the dispute. 3-4 weeks go by, and a message is received the Sprinkler Warehouse provided information that the package was delivered at the front door. ??? This is what I provided from the beginning, but this information was not shown in the dispute, why? Where is this information because it cannot be true. I asked PayPal for this information and received not response. Tried contacting Sprinkler Warehouse and they would not provide any information, or proof, but referred to the dispute being closed by PayPal. What a perfect scam. Once a seller understands that PayPal covers for them, they do not have to provide any customer service when someone uses PayPal for the purchase. We are out the money and have not received what was ordered. This should be a very simple matter to resolve and the few times we have had issues in the past the seller would easily resolve it by initiating a trace, only they can do this.\nPayPal is creating a situation that promotes providing no support. Take the money, end of story. Thanks to PayPal, once a seller see this, they can let PayPal cover for them and laugh off the buyer. Very poor practice by Sprinkler Warehouse, but even worse is PayPal by allow this and even promoting poor support. Buyer be ware, PayPal will not help with any issue, even simple ones.', 'review_date': '2020-05-27', 'review_time': '03:25:22', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
