Shouldn\'t it have been obvious that i was telling the truth from a website that looks completely fake?! Nope. Not according to Paypal, which assumed it was legit. I had to cancel all my cards and everything. Not to mention i had to break back into my hacked Steam account. I am still on their probation lock, even after a year and 2 months later. Any normal service this wouldve expired the lock, even FB jail wouldnt have lasted this long. And because of it, today i was denied for "4 Day Pay" on Mercari.

It's almost as if they know you have no other alternatives so they will mess you about and never provide any actual help. The customer service that their clerks provide is equivalent if not worse than what a bot could do.\nEvery single time I had to speak with them they were unhelpful, seemed to have no knowledge about their own systems, shifted the blame to everyone but themselves, gave me scripted and completely USELESS responses (just thinking about it raises my blood pressure).\nI live for the day when the negligence that Paypal puts in will backfire and a newer, better company will take their throne.\n\nThe ONLY reason I give them a 2* review is because whilst their service is crap, and their website is buggy, they are a very useful service to have.\nDo better Paypal.", 'review_date': '2022-12-30', 'review_time': '16:06:04', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
