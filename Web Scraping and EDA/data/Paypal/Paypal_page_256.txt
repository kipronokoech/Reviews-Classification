I have no clue how they let this happen considering its almost impossible for PayPal to let anything go through unless the money is available. Yet they let this fraudulent account get negative over $200.00. Anyway, so now I have my REAL ACCOUNT WITH A LIMITATION on it until this negative balance is paid. Which reming you I DO NOT OWE. Now I have no access to the 231.00 in my REAL ACCOUNT. The only features available are receive money or payments, Refund money to customers, add money to PayPal account, add bank account, add debit or credit card, update your profile, Display PayPal logos on site or auction, Convert currencies. The features suspended that I cannot use are pay using PayPal, send money or payments, withdraw money from PayPal, remove bank account, remove debit or credit card, Close PayPal account. Not to mention I find all this out yesterday and when I talk to customer service. Then I’m told I have to file a police report. Which I did actually while still on the phone with the customer service representative. Let me rewind a little when I was talking to PayPal, I come to find out they have already sold this debt to credit Corp solutions. That is all they would tell me couldn’t tell me the balance. Wouldn’t tell me ANY DETAILS about this FRAUDULANT ACCOUNT. I procced to call credit Corp and they tell me I have already been deemed responsible for this debt. Along with the police report I also go even further and make a report with the FEDERAL TRADE COMMISION. Anyway, I have no access to MY MONEY. This is unacceptable and I will be closing my PayPal account as soon as I can get MY MONEY RELEASED. I will also be telling anyone who will listen how much of a FRAUD PayPal really is. Not like this is the FIRST COMPLAINT like this. PayPal seems to be NOTORIOUS for putting account holders MONEY ON HOLD. They also are known to put LIMITATIONS on customers accounts for literally ANY AND EVERY LITTLE THING THEY CAN. They try to ACT LIKE this is for your OWN SECURITY. That’s a complete joke.

Good luck having reports from the bank supporting your claim and notifying them of an obvious gap. Enjoy being talked at, condescended too, made to feel guilty or at fault for errors which may or may not have been yours. In this case the vendor routed to PP not the credit card request.\n\nLike a hamster on a wheel both individuals in this department were adamant about the process being fine and the bank and individual at fault. Heres where the PTSD and anxiety come in. Yes, making your customers feel ignorant is not a good policy and or procedure. Not wanting to fix or address and admitted gap in the system also a failure. Having barn animals stepping on the conversation almost through its entirety... well, PP I'm sure will come up with a reason why that's part of the policy. How farm animals are support animals for their employees who have no idea what supporting a client is.\n\nUltimately, PP's client support and shady business practices is beyond reprehensible. Lucky for PP, it's hired the right amount of stress inducing, fault not fact staff and managers they could find.\n\nSo... the next time PP tries to withdraw money already paid (and confirmed by Customer Service as overcharged) and uses the line that you and your bank are wrong or it takes 10 days to clear so we keep trying.
