They are telling me that my account is closing from the vague reason of violation of PayPal's Acceptable Use Policy. What i did first is messaging them on the paypal website and asking for a more specific reason, first I received an automated message which i responded to so a person can answer me. The second answer i think it was by a person but it wasn't telling me why my account is closing, just that my account was reviewed and they think it should be closed. I replied to that answer again and told them what i am using PayPal for and ask them again the reason why i was permanently limited. They simply answered that the decision cannot be overturned and that my funds will be frozen for 180 days. I called them on April 18th and explained to them again what I use PayPal for and they issued a new revision for my account which i never got an answer for after 72 hours of waiting. I was using my PayPal account for about 2 years and I had no disputes over this time period, the account was verified and I gave all my personal information when I created it as well as added my credit card & bank account.

Their company lacks responsibility and would not help you when there is a fraud transaction!!\n\nI started using PayPal a week ago to purchase flowers for my Grilfriend oversea. I didn't want to use my credit card to pay in a foreign website so I chose PayPal since I thought they would protect my money in case of any fake website scam. So that went smoothly. However few days later while I was asleep at 3AM, my PayPal got hacked and three transactions went through with three PlayStation codes bought through a website called Dundle. There was actually another transaction that was in process to go through but somehow got canceled. After I did some googling, apparently Dundle is a sketchy website as well and a lot of ppl got scammed/was charged without ever heard of the website.\n\nAnyhow, I contacted PayPal to investigate the unauthorized transaction, and they replied three hours later telling me they have reviewed and determined no unauthorized transactions happened. Now my first thought was they wanted to brush me off because an investigation shouldn't be this short... Nevertheless, I later called PayPal to ask for their explanation how they came to that conclusion, and the customer lady said there was no suspicious IP address that had logged into my account (I found out that a hacker with trojan malware can easily fake an IP) and therefore determined no unauthorized activity and all she told me was to call my bank to resolve this...\n\nLet me warn you...PayPal's security is a total disaster, when i queried the customer lady why they don't have otp in place, all she told me was that their system only needs someone to log in to make a transaction... And when I asked her why didn't they catch any suspicious activity when one transaction was stopped but three transactions of the same purchase went through all within 5 mins, and she said that is how PayPal payment works. Also, many people online complained about the company Dundle and how they got scammed/charged on PayPal without ever buying from them, but PayPal took no action over the years to protect their customers from falling into a pishy company like Dundle!\n\nI told her I am going to take this to the local police to investigate and I asked if the police found a fraudulent case would PayPal refund the money. She said their company will have to investigate further to determine, as if the police's report aren't credible enough.\n\nWHAT A JOKE! DO NOT TRUST PAYPAL!
