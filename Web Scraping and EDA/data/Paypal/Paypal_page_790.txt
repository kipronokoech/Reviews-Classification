They don't look at cases opened and actually refunded me on over 500 cases I opened against Ebay shipping.\nThey were not cases just inquires about the over 500 payments I made to them. I knew my PayPal account and Ebay accounts had been hacked and they would do nothing for me so I sent Ebay over 500 messages asking them if they had received the money i sent them to make sure it was not going to the people who have hacked in to PayPal and their customers accounts and bank accounts as well. All of them got paid without a single response from Ebay. All of the sudden the money came in to my account on all claims. The one is not for the service it is for a HUGE security problem they have with hackers stealing PayPal customers as well as Ebay customers using developer apps from Google and others like Windows and Microsoft. There is a huge Financial bubble getting ready to bust and the Wells Fargo issue is nothing compared to what is going on right now. People are having money stolen from them via PayPal account and connected banks and are not realizing it. You must do the math on the Pending charges and deposits.This is a huge problem arising from early release Apps being sold in other countries and the problem is that PayPal nor Ebay nor the Banks realize what is going on.
