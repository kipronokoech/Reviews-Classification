It took more than two months, but I got it. As soon as I saw the package, I knew that something was wrong. Sure enough, they sent me the wrong items ( inflatable paddleboards age 6+ ( so you know my kids 14 and 18y.o.)). When I contacted the seller, they wrote to me that the items are of good quality and I should be happy. I contacted several times Paypal ( no direct phone number to speak with live person), they kept brushing me off every time. Finally they replied to me that there was nothing wrong with the order and they closed the case. I cannot describe how to disappoint I am with Paypal!!! Some scam got my $185+ and Paypal did not protect me as the client!! I closed my account with them. For the rest of my life, I will be telling and writing everywhere I possibly could how Paypal screwed me over.

Now they’ve locked my entire account, I’ve provided all of the information they needed, and still my account is locked even though I have another credit card on it that should be able to be used. And there is nobody to speak with to get this resolved. There are some companies that only allow purchases through PayPal, that is the only reason why I feel forced to stay with them. Right now my only way to resolve this appears to be to shut down my existing account and start a whole new one, but no guarantees that will work. The government should just simply shut them down, they are too big and are doing a disservice to many people. They are a monopoly and are horrible.

A company was advertising falsely and accepting monies only to send customers an ornamental replica of the robotic item advertised. The company had already offered me a few dollars refund, not even as much as the postage, and Paypal's resolution was to offer a refund of even less than this. When I refused it I was told that (after careful consideration) the case was closed. I am wise to the fake advertising and won't make the same mistake. But I gave PayPal masses of information about the transaction and dispute in the interest of all customers in hope that PayPal wouldn't continue processing payments to knowingly bogus companies.
