Couple of days later, £100 left my bank account, which was a surprise, but still felt reassured. THEN, refund changed to 'cancelled', no explanation, no e-mail.

Not even 'received will get back'.\nSo, seems you are protected, as long as 'seller' is legitimate & honourable, If not, tough luck, at least P/pal & E-bay got their commission/charges - as a lay person, seems to me that this is handling stolen goods (ie handing my money to unknown persons, with no recourse.\nUpdate, case settled 'in my favour', 'waited for seller to respond', finally 'closed, RESOLVED' still without a refund being received. NO contact from P/pal, cannot raise another case, no reply to ANY mails sent to P/pal. Had to start complaint to financial ombudsman- will update if anything transpires.

Even after receiving more than 300 payments worth 10K USD, no Premium services were offered.

This can be expected from a bot but what kind of human beings are employed at PayPal? I wonder if these employees have completed their schooling, even!\n\n3. During their copy paste answers they l provide the account manager email. Send 3 emails and no response. No contact number was provided initially. When I found it in their help section the number didn't exist.\n\n4. Out of 300 transactions there were 3 disputes raised of less than 1% of the total turnover amount and in spite of giving refund to the clients my account was permanently blocked.\n\n5. Moreover, due to the refund I owe PayPal 160 USD and when I try to pay what's due, it asks me to send them a cheque in USD from my base location in India. I was surprised that such a big company has no other online payment options.
