Each email blamed the merchant and then me for Paypal\'s double charge to my account. I even got a separate email blaming me for setting up the payment as a recurring charge when Paypal was responsible for it. Enough was enough.\n\nI tried to delete my Paypal account, only to be faced with three days of shenanigans from these filthy jackals. They wouldn\'t allow me to close my account because I had a non-existent "open case" which was not visible in my Paypal account. I was told to close the case but there was nothing to close. I sent them a message with screenshot of my case screen, it was ignored for two days. Finally I noticed a different case number in one of their emails. They never informed me that they had created another ticket. I had to do a search to find it, then I closed it.\n\nStill no luck deleting my account, with no explanation. I wrote them an email threatening legal action if my account isn\'t closed within 48 hours. That got their attention. It turns out that they had set up a year old one time payment as a recurring payment again, without my knowledge, just like the air conditioner, so that they could plunder my bank account at their leisure. Once again this "recurring payment" didn\'t appear anywhere in my profile. That was why I couldn\'t close my account.\n\nThese greedy, dishonest, sticky fingered weasels do not deserve access to anyone\'s cards or bank accounts. Thank God I\'m finally rid of them.\n================================\nI made the mistake of buying an air conditioner from a merchant website using Paypal. The thieves entered the transaction twice. I didn\'t have the funds in my account to cover the second charge, so my bank froze my account because of Paypal\'s "authorization hold". Almost two weeks later the extra hold still sits in my account and my funds are still frozen. When I tried to get Paypal to reverse the duplicate charge the arrogant criminals proceeded to lie that they weren\'t responsible and blame it on the merchant. They claimed to have contacted the merchant and stated that they refuse to reverse the second transaction for another two weeks "to wait for the merchant\'s response".\n\nI called the merchant and they had no record of the second transaction because they weren\'t the ones who put it through, so they couldn\'t reverse it. They also told me that Paypal never contacted them about my order. So they lied about that too. I went back to Paypal and they still refuse to take responsibility, claiming that they have a "process" which prevents them from doing anything for another TWO WEEKS. I told them that\'s not acceptable since they\'ve caused me to be blocked from accessing my own money and I need to buy groceries. I provided them with screenshots of the two transactions on their own website, as well as the transactions in my bank.\n\nSince then these crooks have been sending me text messages through their website several times a day, taunting me about their refusal to reverse the duplicate transaction, every day they send a countdown "eight days left", "seven days left" etc. and tell me to "watch my email". Since they refuse to reverse the duplicate transaction in a timely manner and I can\'t wait two weeks to get access to my money, I have applied for a chargeback with my credit card company and bank. They can explain to the merchant why they\'ve lost the value of an air conditioner, and they can pay the misuse of authorization hold and chargeback fees.', 'review_date': '2021-07-27', 'review_time': '15:39:24', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

( I was given a 1 time code to speed up my wait time, which didn’t work). Once I got to speak to someone I was told that my bank is rejecting the transaction and I need to call them.\n\nSo I did and the Bank said they had no record that the transaction was even attempted. Being very upset at this point, I called back, (again with a new 1 time code to speed up the process, and no I’d did not work again). After almost a half an hour of waiting on hold, I get a new person and I explained the entire thing to him. He didn’t listen to what I said at all and kept repeating the same thing over and over that it was the banks fault. He then tried to lie to me about the transaction, and when I called him on it he got even more rode, (If that was even possible). He said that it is not his problem and that was that. Before he could hang up on me. I told him to cancel my account. He said fine and then said that I would receive an email with the confirmation.\n\nThis is the best part that really makes me want the world to know how they handle things.
