After receiving my purchase I immediately started having problems with the item not functioning and reported this to Zwilling who gave me the runaround but finally requested a return of the item at my expense no less.\nI refused as this would reduce my refund considerably having to pay shipping for a return on a defective item.\nI then filed a claim with PayPal who let it sit for ten days with no communication and finally contacted me on the decision. Much to my amazement, they sided with Zwilling and suggested I ship the item back at my expense even though the item was defective and covered under warranty. I then called PayPal customer service, but to no avail, the agent was adamant in backing Zwilling over me who had received defective goods. Do not think PayPal gives you any kind of insurance when making a purchase, it doesn't, this whole claim process is a farce, seemingly, they will always rule in favor of the seller, shame on them!", 'review_date': '2023-02-02', 'review_time': '16:35:50', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
