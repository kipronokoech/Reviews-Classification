I don’t even think they have one.

I bought a 26’ folding ladder for just under $100. When it didn’t arrive, I contacted PayPal and opened a dispute. PayPal eventually ruled in favor of the vender, saying they provided proof of delivery from USPS. After a day and a half of trying to figure out what went wrong, a supervisor at USPS said the wrong address was listed on the package by the vender and was delivered to someone else’s address. They got my city correct, but the address was miles away. I contacted PayPal and they said I needed to get a particular form from USPS to verify that someone else’s address was put on the ladder. The supervisor at USPS said he’d never heard of that form and couldn’t find the form anywhere on their list of forms on their database. The second time I went to the post office, the USPS Supervisor wrote me a note and put the USPS stamp on the note, along with his contact info in place of this mysterious form. PayPal would not accept the note and kept insisted I get the USPS form that does not exist. At this point I asked to speak to a PayPal manager. The PayPal rep said a manager would contact me. That was well over a week ago. Still no contact! Disappointing to say the least!! I’ve been using PayPal from early on, regularly, without any problem. Now, after seeing so many bad reviews for PayPal, I realize I must have been lucky all this time. I don’t feel lucky now. I’m out $100, a ladder and my trust in PayPal, forever!\n\nUPDATE: PayPal finally called me and said they would give me a full refund. I would have appreciated a call sooner, but I got my refund, so I’m thankful for that. My advice - if PayPal wrongfully rules against your claim, ask to speak with a manager if you’re getting nowhere with a customer service rep, be patient for the managers return phone call (2 weeks in my case) and make sure you document everything! Wish I could get the day and a half back I spent figuring out what happened and how to deal with PayPal’s nonsensical request of a USPS form that doesn’t exist!', 'review_date': '2021-05-11', 'review_time': '18:24:15', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

Recently paypal has been advertising several bitcoin options with the option to purchase. It is giving the risk information as it should however it does not state anywhere on their website ( including their terms that you can not use a VPN while.making a purchase.) It took a customer service rep and me to figure out that that was an issue. Aparently paypal can chose to close your account permanently ( evenso ownership has been established and no fraught was involved )without just cause and hold your money for 180 days They also can and will refuse to give a reason. I am appalled by their new business practices.
