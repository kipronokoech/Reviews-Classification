It took 2 days of trying to get in touch with payapl over the phone. Paypal told me I have to report a crime saying I have been conned and get a crime number. Basically take them to court and if I win paypal will refund my money. I started to take action but soon realised I wasn't going to get anywhere with it. As a result I lost my money and my item.
