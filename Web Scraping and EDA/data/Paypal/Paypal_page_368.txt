I\nHAD ALREADY BEEN DOING BUSINESS WITH THEM FOUR YEARS PRIOR and was in the process of re-establishing my account because I bought out my business partner and was going thru the necessary changes. I wanted to purchase a product so I used the pay as a guest option to complete the transaction. Five days after I completed the transaction, I, unfortunately, realized I was being ripped off. So I went through the process with my credit card company which they advised me also to start the process with PayPal. So because I waited on hold for over an hour, I finally spent another twenty minutes trying to find out how to do it online. I contacted them via chat and left a message with the receipt number and info I received when I paid for the product from them. I had already uploaded the documents they need to verify my identity for my account and twice told them the problem I was having was a purchase the was completed as a guest. I get an email hours later with the heading"we care" but they were not going to review my complaint because I had not given them what they needed to verify who I am when I already had, but that\'s not here or there as I completed the transaction in question as a quest. So if you purchase something as a guest and have all the information they need to investigate and do the right thing with their heading "we care" they clearly do not and you are rolling the dice considering not only did the attempt to screw me over they did it twice by doing business with a company that at minimum is very shady.', 'review_date': '2021-03-19', 'review_time': '13:07:12', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
