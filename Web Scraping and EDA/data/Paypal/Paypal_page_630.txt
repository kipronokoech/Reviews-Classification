Its been like this since 2016 they don't even know what they're doing!!!!.\nSo I can't add my other bank account to my PayPal for some reason... Obviously due to coronavirus there is no customer support via Landline or mobile. Instead I messaged them on their new Message Centre.\n\nI waited 26 hours to get a response!. It couldn't get any worse because the guy literally told me to dial their customer support number and told me there is lack of customer support due to Coronavirus. Before I could type anything he told me to have a good day and took off.......... Motherf**ker there is no phone support and you work for support why didn't u know this?. So I guess I have to wait another 26 hours... (Probably to get some brain dead person for support again).\n\nI felt physically sick after waiting that long and not being able to access my money... Everyone is out there panic buying and stocking up on food am sat here hungry waiting for PayPal to reply..... Screw you PayPal\n\nUpdate: I tried to log into my PayPal this afternoon and now my account is BLOCKED and I have to contact support to regain access to it..... At this point am so angry they can keep my money. No point trying because they just send me in circles and am forever waiting for support to reply.", 'review_date': '2020-03-23', 'review_time': '22:43:34', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
