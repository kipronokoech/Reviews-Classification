Rang them up and they advised a couple of other methods and nothing worked, they said I have to wait 72 hours before trying again and their is no way at all to override the security lock on the system. They said if it didn’t work when trying again after 72 hours I’d have to find other method of payment. Theirs money on my credit account available that I can’t spend and no one can override a computer system, how does any of that make sense at all, completely ridiculous set up what an absolute shambles! Why can’t the system be changed eg make a simple phone call get a code sent or something so they can confirm it and unlock it, and 72 hours? Who made up that stupid rule? The big question is how is there nothing a human can possibly do to change the system?', 'review_date': '2023-06-25', 'review_time': '12:56:12', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
