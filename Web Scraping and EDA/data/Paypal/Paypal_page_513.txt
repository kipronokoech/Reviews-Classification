I ordered something off a company and did not receive it, i advised paypal 2 months ago and i have bad a resolution case open ever since. my beef with conpal is that they keep pushing the resolution date out by 5 days here, a week there and when you call the customer services, the staff have pigeon english and don't give a rats a## about you, your money or your woes. This is not the paypal of 10 years ago. The customer is not fully protected like they advertise but rather their customer seems to be their main priority. I would advise people to use alternative methods of payment as paypal is no longer a safety net. If something goes wrong and you are the innocent party, you will have to fight blood, swaet and tears to try and get what is rightfully yours (your money back)", 'review_date': '2020-09-07', 'review_time': '20:35:21', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
