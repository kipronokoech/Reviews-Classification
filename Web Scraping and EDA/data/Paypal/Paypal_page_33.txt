For straight payments I have found them very good. However if there is a dispute the Resolution Center is an absolute disaster. There is no common sense or logic involved. In my latest problem the service from Resolution Center was appalling.\nThere was never a dispute. PayPal misunderstood the original message from the "Payer" and concocted a dispute that had nothing to do with the message sent by "Payer". This message just informed PayPal that "Payee" had not yet received the money. "Payer" never mentioned non-delivery of goods or items. In fact this was purely a monetary transaction where "Payer" was refunding part of a payment previously made by "Payee" to "Payer". PayPal never contacted "Payer" but kept on insisting that he was the only party that could close the dispute. On 19th July "Payee" received a phone call from PayPal Dublin in Ireland advising "Payee" that the dispute had been resolved and that "Payee" could expect payment within 72 hours. This of course did not happen. After a month of fruitless messages to the Resolution Center "Payer" advised "Payee" that the money less charges had been refunded into his account and asked how he should now pay "Payee". "Payee" has told him try PayPal again and not raise any queries. "Payee" now wants to make a formal complaint to higher management at PayPal but this appears to be impossible. PayPal has now charged "Payee" USD 8 for dispute charges. Someone tries to pay you, PayPal creates a non-existent dispute, you don\'t get the payment but end up owing PayPal money.
