Buyer Protection guarantees that the buyer gets what he/she paid for. OK, so far, so good. However, I received 2 shirts from a sham retailer based in China called Cotosen. I ordered two 3XL shirt sizes, but one turned out to be too large and the other too tight. Further, the material was shoddy and there were no tags attached to the clothing to suggest how it should be washed. Finally, I ordered 2 RED shirts, but they turned out to be only red on one side; on the other, they were white. So, many problems. I contacted the seller but most of the time my emails were ignored. I then contacted Paypal to file a dispute in an attempt to get a full refund. Today Paypal refused my claim, arguing that: "We\'ve reviewed the transaction(s) and are refusing your claim(s). This decision was made because Buyer Protection only covers item(s) or services that weren\'t delivered or are significantly not-as-described." So, my shirts were delivered and they were red shirts, but as noted above there were many other issues with the product. Paypal never took that into consideration. As long as companies fulfill their minimal obligations, then Paypal will always support them, meaning that you the Buyer will be left holding poor-quality goods as well as being out of pocket. In my opinion, it\'s much better to bypass Paypal altogether and deal directly with your bank.', 'review_date': '2021-12-31', 'review_time': '18:17:11', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

They only said that they will open an investigation to Yodel, the delivery company and it has been 2 months since I have not received any response. They only said to me that \' Yodel says that they deliver and they believe them.\'\nI raised this issue to Paypal and open a dispute. After a few days, Paypal replied to me back and said that \'Mataplay sent them the delivery proof and my claim is rejected.\' I asked both companies to send me that proof since I know that it was all about a text from Yodel.\nNeither Paypal nor Mataplay did not give me a satisfactory reply.\nI paid Â£130 for something which is delivered somewhere else. And Paypal did not support me with a basic solution.\n\nI know that if the courier leaves the parcel to someone else or in a certain place where I didnâ€™t address them beforehand, itâ€™s not my responsibility if it gets lost. It is also written on their website that the delivery company Yodel should have asked me for my signature. They should be aware of their irresponsibility. (you can check it from the citizen advice website)\n\nI desperately raised my complaint once more to Paypal and they sent me their final response as below.\n\n"Our review of your PayPal account is now complete, and this is our final response. In these circumstances, the matter raised in your complaint is not accepted. We describe below what weâ€™ve done to investigate your complaint.\n\nOur understanding is that your complaint is related to recent activity on your account. It appears that a PayPal team member helped you with your questions and so was able to provide a resolution. Our review of your account shows that your complaint has been addressed.\n\nWe value you as a customer and weâ€™re satisfied that our actions, in this case, were correct, fair, and reasonable under the circumstances.\nWe trust that our decision brings this matter to a close. If you need any additional information relating to your PayPal account, please donâ€™t hesitate to contact us."\n\nPaypal only cares about if they reply to a message or not. They did not give me an answer about \'that proof of delivery or how they agreed with Mataplay and how they decided that I was not right.\'\n\nIn the end, Paypal was covering the company\'s back not the customer and it was such a shame that they closed the issue and accept that I paid Â£130 for something that is delivered to the wrong address. And they accepted this is a normal thing.\'\n\nThink several times when you order from a website via Paypal. If you had a problem with the order or delivery. Paypal will be on the company side, not yours. Now the company does not reply to me at all and Paypal will not dig the problem anymore.', 'review_date': '2021-12-31', 'review_time': '00:02:33', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
