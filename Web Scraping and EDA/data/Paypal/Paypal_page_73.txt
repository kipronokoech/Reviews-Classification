On the positive side, it is convenient to use PayPal for online purchases and transactions, and their buyer protection program can be helpful if there are any issues with a purchase.\n\nHowever, my main issue with PayPal is their customer service. I have had several instances where I needed assistance with an issue, but their customer service team was slow to respond and unhelpful when they did. This made resolving the issue a frustrating and time-consuming process.\n\nAdditionally, I have had some issues with PayPal's fees and exchange rates. They often charge high fees for international transactions, and their exchange rates can be unfavorable compared to other options.\n\nOverall, while PayPal can be a convenient option for online transactions, their customer service and fees leave something to be desired.

I provided all of the parties with bank statement, hotel receipt, PayPal history. The biggest mistake - only later I realized what the PayPal employees did: they flagged one payment.
