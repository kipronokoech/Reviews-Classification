Ironically, PayPal said that our business account is unlimited but now that probably we are trying to withdraw our money on monthly based , they saw that its a huge amount they decided to keep removing our bank account asking for a lot of proof which we provided, even asking all for very sensitive information about our supplier, how much we pay for our products, our customers tracking code, confidential information, which we all provided, our account has been resumed and still they don't allow any transfer of money. They reply maybe after hours or even weeks. Not a good platform given the fact that they do charge a lot per transaction, and we thought that give us more protection but at the end, they did block all our money. I dont know if its possible to further escalate our complaint because they play with asking really private information from us, even after legal proof they are playing with money will be transfer after 7 days, and then denied transaction.

Then they tell me " I suggest you dont make any new paypal accounts cause my account will get freeze again" when I asked for someone who can give me CLEAR explanation they sent my call to their manager and was on hold for half hour before they hung up.

After confronting them on the phone, they eventually issued me a refund, which is the only reason why this is a review and not a formal complaint.
