They were no help at all and was just interested un quite rudely stating they want payment as my bank had stopped payment (bank was the one who informed me about frudulant payment). It was also hard to contact paypal as their chat did not work and no contact number findable. They state your money is safe and they help you but they do not. I finally recieved call from them, as stated above was only interested in getting money. I had to open a resolve case against paypal to try to get any solution to this issue, they refused to engage in any communication with them, so i had to escalate it. During this time i had received few calls from paypal and again quite aggressively demanding payment, when asked them to go through resolve as was getting nowhere with them myself. Wish has since confirmed it was a frudulant order and refunded the payment back to paypal. So not only did my bank confirm it was a frudulant transaction but also the company that made the order confirmed it but paypal stated it wasnt. They state they help with any issues you have including frudulant payment.
