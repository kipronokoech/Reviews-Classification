I asked the man if there was anyway to make this dispute close sooner and he said yes he would put it in the system as 6-7 days. After the 7th day I called back and was then told they did not see that in the system and it would take the full 10 days although that's not what I was told. So On the 11th day..finally.. (yesterday) I recieved an email saying I won the case but that it would take 5-7 business days to receive my refund which Is NOT what I was told on the phone.

After conducting business for months, accepting orders and receiving a PayPal credit card in the mail, I was sent an email asking for further documentation. After providing a lengthly description of my business plan with thorough documentation I was notified by PayPal that my account was being permanently limited. Immediately calling the PayPal support team I was transferred to four different departments and not given a single answer as to why my account was under such scrutiny. Finally, a representative set up an appointment for the PayPal risk department to call me back over 24 hours later, since oddly enough the customer isn\'t provided and number to reach them. I explained my simplistic business plan once again and reminded them that I sent an email with proof and descriptions. The employee, Jennifer, assured me that once sending in further proof of invoice and documentation that my account with them would be slightly limited and eventually lifted, chalking it up to miscommunication. After once again being put on hold for a lengthly amount of time I was greeted with an "I\'m sorry, we\'ve decided to shut down the entire account because of its liabilities." I was asked in an accusatory tone if I was making up orders to collect money because a family member with the same last name placed an order on my website. In the end, the disorganization and disregard for their customers is so evident its shocking and disappointing. For an honest customer who is simply just trying to grow their business it is hard to find an excuse for PayPals brash mistreatment. On a positive note, I have made the decision to use Square instead, which is a leading competitor offering comparable pricing and better customer service.', 'review_date': '2018-09-07', 'review_time': '15:09:53', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
