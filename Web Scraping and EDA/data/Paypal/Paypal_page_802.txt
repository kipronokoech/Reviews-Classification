Then PayPal closed the Dispute claiming that I hadn't responded to communication requests, when I had! So because Paypal closed the Dispute they didn't refund me, and once a Dispute is closed it can't be reopened. So I am well and truly out of pocked. As a Buyer I was NOT Protected. The seller however got his money and got rid of a broke item he wouldn't have been able to sell in his shop in Singapore. Well done PayPal.
