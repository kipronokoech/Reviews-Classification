Several weeks have gone by and I have had few responses and nothing but lies from PayPal and PayPal Prepaid. It is completely UNETHICAL to tell customers that you will refund money if the merchant does not and then not stick to your word and policies. PayPal employees are rude with nasty attitudes. I keep saying that customer service jobs need to go away so that companies can just use robots, especially top companies that see profits of millions or billions of dollars. You can program a robot to work correctly, but you cannot train someone to be nice; kindness and common sense come from within.\n\nLet this be a lesson learned for all: AVOID doing business with payment processing companies like PayPal and AVOID prepaid cards. It is much better to have a regular traditional bank account. I'm not a fan of Bank of America anymore, but when I was a customer there, they had and still have improved measures in place so that when customers experience fraud, BofA refunds the money immediately in many cases. I have another account with a traditional bank and have more faith in them if I ever experience fraud.
