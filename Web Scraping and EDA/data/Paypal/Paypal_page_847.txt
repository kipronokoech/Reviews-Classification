Paypal works as an alternative to credit card purchases online, but there are other ways to make purchases with credit cards while still protecting your cc data. What many consumers like me expect to be able to do with Paypal, though, is send money to small businesses and individual service providers.\n\nLast week I traveled to San Francisco to complete a foreign visa application. I don't live in SF but had to deal with the consulate there so hired a small business to pick up and return my passport & visa to me. I paid them via the Paypal credit card option, confirmed my payment, and left town. Boarding my plane, I got a text from the company that the payment had failed. I contacted Paypal, and sure enough, they'd blocked the payment on fear of fraud. I contacted the fraud department, confirmed my identity and that I wanted to make the payment, and after a half hour's run-around was told the payment had been released and no further action was needed from me. I let the company know that we were good to go and boarded my plane in confidence, sure that the six-month visa application procedure was finally over.\n\nOn arriving home, I found SIX new text messages from the company to the effect that I'd attempted to steal services from them (they'd already done some work on my behalf, including notarizing my diplomas...) and that they wouldn't do any business with me further. I contacted Paypal, and after an HOUR speaking with their fraud department AGAIN, they told me they couldn't do anything about THEIR department blocking my payment, despite my confirmation of my identity. Because of Paypal, I had to pay FOUR TIMES the initial fee to another company for an emergency visa service package. And I used a competitor of Paypal (Square Cash) to do it.\n\nProtecting consumers from fraud is one thing, but destroying our reputations with businesses and refusing to allow us to make payments, thereby frustrating the very reason for having a Paypal account is quite another--and it is the latter scenario that in todays increasingly mobile, small-business services world consumers are finding ourselves, thanks to Paypal's antiquated, hyper-regimented way of doing business.\n\nWe won't be doing business with Paypal anymore. There's not a single service this untrustworthy, incompetent company offers which we cannot do better with a far less cumbersome alternative. Heck, even our credit union (BECU) offers pay-other-people (POP) now directly from our checking/savings account via the payee's email address or phone # (and they never see your account information, only have to accept payment). That's how we pay most of our bills, small businesses, and friends. And you can use credit card masking services to make payments online via your credit card while protecting your privacy (exactly why we thought we needed Paypal--but we don't).\n\nTime to dump Paypal--they're untrustworthy, inefficient, and dangerously bureaucratic.", 'review_date': '2017-06-13', 'review_time': '20:23:09', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
