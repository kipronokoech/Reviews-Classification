USPS wouldn\'t let him send oil by mail, so he sent me $4 to buy a new bottle. Right off the top, Paypal took a fee, and left me with a $3.63 balance. For months, I tried to get that stinkin\' $3.63. I spend over a thousand each month through Paypal with my credit card, but Paypal wouldn\'t let me use the $3.63 because it\'s not a debit card. I don\'t use debit cards. They wanted me to link to my bank account, but I don\'t want Paypal to have access to my bank account. They wanted me to get a Paypal debit card, but why would I trust Paypal for something else when they are already charging me fees to use my money. They could send me a check for $3.63, but there is a $1.50 charge for that, too. Finally, I found a Paypal rep who said he could get the $1.50 charge waived and get me a check for $3.63. Well, I got the check yesterday for $2.13. Paypal left $1.50 balance in my account. Now, to get that $1.50 sent by check, it will cost me a fee of $1.50, or I can link Paypal to my bank account and thousands of dollars or pay who-knows-what kinds of fees to have their credit card. I\'m not worried about $1.50, it was just nagging me to hear "you have a balance of $1.50" or seeing it every time I checked my account. So, to zero my balance, for very nice crook at Paypal arranged to donate the $1.50 to a charity, of his choice. What a pack of slimeball crooks. Don\'t use Paypal to move your money around, or at least be aware that they will have their hands always in it. Please, someone give us a fair and honest option!!!
