When there's a dispute, it's usually straightforward and efficient in resolving them in your favour, particularly if you have lots of evidence and track all correspondence. The issue, however – and as many have already highlighted – is when trying to resolve a scam dispute. It appears that for some reason, PayPal is very passive, and instead of automatically actioning refunds amidst mounting evidence like banks do with similar disputes, they play along with the scammers' games and instruct you to return an item for way more than the refund amount to 'receive a refund' – only for said item to be returned because of the incorrect address the scammer supplied. Again, you have to be very vigilant, stern and forthright and challenge PayPal at every step in order to receive your full refund. It seems there's no human process involved in its dispute resolutions, which is why the experience appears clunky. They should take a leaf out of banks' books and actually have a team of people to review cases.", 'review_date': '2021-06-29', 'review_time': '06:40:08', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

I ordered an item from a seller and paid via PayPal. The item never arrived. I raised a dispute with PayPal. In the meantime I contacted the Royal Mail who confirmed, after looking at their records, that the seller made a mistake and addressed the item to the wrong delivery address. This was, they told me, clearly shown on the tracking receipt given to the seller, but he refused to admit his error and would not respond to any contact from me. Unfortunately, because of data protection, the Royal Mail were unable to disclose the address the seller had incorrectly used.\n\nPayPal advised me to gain a letter from the Royal Mail confirming the item was never addressed to my address and then to upload this to the Resolution Centre so their back office staff could consider the evidence. It took a week, but I received the letter via email from the Royal Mail. However, the option to upload the letter to the PayPal Resolution Centre was not available to me. I rang PayPal to ask for assistance in uploading the document and was told that option didn't exist. I was told that there was no point in uploading or sending the letter to them as they wouldn't accept it or look at it as part of their dispute process. I queried this, as they were the ones that asked me to get the letter in the first place. I made it clear that the letter from the Royal Mail officially proved the seller made an error and that I never received the item. Still they told me this wouldn't be accepted. The only evidence they would look at is the Royal Mail tracking information, which of course states the item was successfully delivered (but to the wrong address of course)! After countless phone calls, messages via their Facebook service etc, they refused to accept the letter from the Royal Mail they asked for in the first place and closed the complaint in the seller's favour.\n\nUtterly despicable actions from a company that is weighted against the buyer. They operate within a moral vacuum. There is no right of appeal against their decision either. I have now had to lodge a formal complaint against them with the financial ombudsman here in the UK. Based on my experience, my advice to anyone thinking of using PayPal would be to give them a wide berth. Use your credit or debit card instead. At least your bank or credit card company will have a fair and lawful dispute and resolution process in place which will consider all of the evidence available. Unfortunately, from my experience, it would appear the staff are like drones, only able to read from pre-written call scripts with no ability to deviate. They simply repeat the same sentences over and over again or provide knowingly inaccurate instructions / guidance simply to get you off the phone. I spoke to one manager and asked her 'how do you sleep at night knowing that you are deliberately deceiving customers that are just trying to do the right thing. How can you settle disputes against them, even when proof or evidence exists in their favour'....her reply 'because that's the process sir'. Absolutely priceless!
