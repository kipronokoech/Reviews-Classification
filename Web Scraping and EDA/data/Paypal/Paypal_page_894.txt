When I explained that my mum did not do that they insisted that she did. ( that was their professional "expert" opinion ). I have repaid the balance, closed my paypal account - after 13 years with no issues, my mum also closed hers - and we are in the process of suing paypal as we don\'t know where the money went. They say they\'re challenging the chargeback on my behalf and once they find out what happened they will return the money. They better do it before they\'re sued.\nDon\'t purchase stuff with paypal if you can buy it with a credit or debit card. If you request a refund with the card you\'ll get it as soon as the seller actuates it - with paypal you\'ll get it whenever they decide to give it to you. ( You might have to wait for 2-3 weeks while they\'re making interes...I mean "investigating" on your money ;). Paypal loves freezing your funds every opportunity they can get... and good luck in getting your point across to their Indian call centre staff who have been trained professionally to learn how to tell you that they can do absolutely nothing about it.
