I was dissatisfied, so I asked them for a refund, they agreed to give me a refund, and I have PROOF that\'s what they said.\n\nThe person then decided not to respond to me at all, so I took it up with Paypal, explained what was going on, and sent them my evidence on November 15th. On November 19th, two days after the money got sent out, Paypal tells me that they denied my request, because "the transaction was processed correctly, and there was no problem". It does not matter if it was processed correctly, not if the other party AGREED to give me a refund, and on top of that, it doesn\'t take 4 DAYS to figure out that someone is being scammed out of their money. If Chase saw I was getting scammed, they would contact me on the SAME DAY, so Paypal has no excuse for this.\n\nSlowest response time I have ever seen from ANY company, I needed help and they denied it.

I went to put in a dispute and before I could even put in a complaint paypal sent a notification stating they most likely wouldn’t be able to do anything about the charge and that I would have to file a dispute with my bank. This was already odd to me and when I looked it up, it was thousands of other people being scammed by paypal and Microsoft with the same exact issue. Fast forward, I go online to put in a dispute with my bank and the transaction wasn’t able to be disputed thru the pnc website I had to physically go to the bank and sign a statement saying that I was scammed so that I could get my money back which I’ve never had to do before so clearly Microsoft knew they were scamming and must be getting lots of chargebacks. After I put in a paper dispute on the situation paypal locked my account and claimed I needed to send in bank statements to prove it was my account even tho THEYRE the ones that told me to contact my bank. I’ve had a few disputes thru paypal in the past years but I’ve NEVER been asked to show bank statements. I’ve been with paypal for at least 9 years and never had this issue. It’s funny to me tho that they will allow me to still accept my store payments thru paypal (which I wouldnt do anyway because of their ridiculous fees and lackluster seller protection) but I can’t transfer money out, or purchase anything. I’ve decided after 10 years to leave paypal and I’d suggest everyone else does too because they don’t appreciate their customers and have terrible service. Now that I can use Apple Pay for most things or just create an account and save my card info I don’t need them anymore anyway. Paypal Sucks! Move on to a processor that actually appreciates their customers and offer them protection.', 'review_date': '2021-11-19', 'review_time': '12:54:33', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

Extremely unhappy with their customer service. Sent money to a friend internationally from the United States. When I did the final review before sending the money, no where stated a transaction fee would be taken out. Paypal took $62.28 out as a transaction fee. Called them 4 times and each time they spouted nonsense by saying "We will send your friend the full amount, just wait 48 hours".\n\nToday was the final straw. Called them for the 5th time and had over an hour phone call with the representative to resolve this issue. 40 minutes out of the hour, she put me on hold and said she was investigating. After she was done "investigating" she said sorry, there is nothing I can do since the money has already been sent. She said that I sent the money to my friend under the category of "goods and services", instead of "friends or family".\n\nI said that when I was sending money through the website, I was not given an option of choosing "friends or family" or "goods and services". I even sent a screenshot through email of what I see when I send money, showing that I did not have that option.\nShe asked if I had just opened an account for the first time and I said yes. The day I sent money to my friend, was the day I opened a paypal account. She said "ahh that is why, when you make your first transaction with paypal, it will be categorized under goods and services and the second time I make a transaction, I will have the option to choose".\n\nI told her that there was no where in writing from paypal that stated that, the first transaction I make, it will be categorized under "goods and services" and have a transaction fee taken out. Heck, there was no transparency even, that there would be a transaction fee when I did a final review before sending the money.\n\nI told her that I don\'t want to hear just a "sorry" from a billion dollar company when it was not my fault to begin with. She offered a $50 voucher, which quite frankly was a slap in my face.\n\nI responded "Does that sound fair to you? Giving me a $50 voucher, after you take $62.28 as a transaction fee?, in which I was not informed about and secondly, had no where in writing that stated the first transaction would be categorized under goods and services."\n\nShe had the audacity to tell me that she thought it was a fair deal and that the next time I send money to use the app instead. She must be delusional, because there won\'t be a next time, especially not with the way they handled this issue. My friend and I have lost confidence in Paypal.\n\nExtremely poor and appalling customer service, poor customer conflict resolution and most of all poor website and security from the company as a whole. You would expect better from a $100 billion dollar company. What a joke.
