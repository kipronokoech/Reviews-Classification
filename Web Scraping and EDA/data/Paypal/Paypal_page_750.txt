Last week I tried logging into my account and I couldn\'t get in as I kept getting an error message saying cannot verify . I called Paypal which they helped me change the password and I was able to get in . Next day same thing happened and PayPal said they will fix it on there end and they will send me an email once its fixed , two minutes later I receive an email stating my account has been limited and I need to provide documents proving the account belongs to me .\nSo when I log in to my account I notice my Paypal balance went from 800 euro down to 50 euro , so I immediately call Paypal who advises that its probably because the account has been limited and once I upload my license and other required documents to prove the account belongs to me , my account will be reviewed and once restored the money should appear back into my account . So I went ahead and uploaded all the required documents and once again after roughly a couple of minutes later I get an email saying my account has been permanently limited and after 180 days I will only get the 50 euro back but the 750 euro that magically disappeared I will not get back .\nAgain I call Paypal and had the pleasure speaking to the rudest person I\'ve ever dealt with who gives me the answer " we don\'t have to tell you anything about why your account was closed , other than we believe its best we no longer do business with you " so I say " you cant just take my money and not give me a legitimate reason of what I have done wrong in order for my account to be closed permanently " which the consultant responds " sir im not going to repeat myself you have my answer we do not have to give you any reasons behind out decision " .\nAlso on top of that I was sending emails asking what was going on and I would receive email\'s from one person stating that they are in charge of taking care of this matter , then the next email I would hear from someone else who change\'s the story of what the previous person said to me . Now I\'ve lost 750 euros which was supposed to go towards building a computer for my little brother but now need to fork out more money to take legal action against Paypal so justice is served . Hope this story keeps people away from this company', 'review_date': '2019-05-07', 'review_time': '18:41:15', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
