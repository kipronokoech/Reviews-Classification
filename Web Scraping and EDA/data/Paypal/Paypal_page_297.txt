I am a business owner who decided to get PayPal for quick and easy card charges. For one, 3.5% fee for card usage is a bit high but doable. What’s not doable is every single transaction, even with “Instant transaction” is not instant. I can understand 12 hours of first time withdrawal to confirm bank is correct, but after the first transaction it’s 72 hours+ for a withdrawal?? Why even offer the instant withdrawal feature like Venmo or Zelle? Do NOT use PayPal for any business affairs. They are a sham and customer service literally told me pretty much every withdrawal is subject to it? And when asked why even offer instant they said, “Well every transaction for withdrawal is subject to a wait period of 30 minutes to 72 hours” Why offer a quick service? No matter what they couldn’t answer that question without a script to read off of. Plus don’t even get me started on trying to get ahold of a person. Will be deleting my account and telling everyone I can possibly reach to not use them. They didn’t care that I am not using them anymore.
