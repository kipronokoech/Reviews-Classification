Unfortunately, in May this year, I use Paypal to pay for a Samsung notebook battery. First of all, it arrived two weeks later than promised. When open the package, the battery apart from not being an original Samsung battery as advertised on their website, it feels so light it feels like an empty case. So without installing them, I raise a claim to the seller and to Paypal who then instructed me to send the battery to an address in China. I sent the battery back by registered post to the address given in June and I just received a SMS from La Poste that the item is returned back to France meaning the address, like the goods, is fake. I also received an email this morning from Paypal Service that they rejected the claim for reason that I did not provide tracking which was provided on 20/06/20.\nSo apart from not being able to discuss with a real human on the telephone to resolve this issue, Paypal also does not check the information properly. Their customer service has really taken a dive!", 'review_date': '2020-10-14', 'review_time': '14:59:44', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

I made a purchase on ebay which turned out to be faulty. The seller is using ebay managed payments. I opened a dispute on Paypal. The seller acknowledged the dispute through ebay managed payments system sent to them from ebay, not Paypal.\n\nThe seller did not receive any correspondence from Paypal. The seller was only aware the dispute came from Paypal because I informed them. The seller accepted the fault and send me a return label. I returned the faulty item to the seller the following day. The seller immediately authorised a refund through ebay managed payments. The authorised refund was confirmed by seller and ebay.\n\nUpon checking my Paypal I noticed the refund had not been processed on my account. According to Paypal customer service, the seller whether that is the actual seller or ebay needs to respond to the claim for them to issue a refund. According to ebay the seller has responded and authorised a refund. Paypal has been fed this information and they are the ones withholding my refund. According to Paypal, no information has been received from the 'seller'. The seller must respond to the case to authorize the refund.\n\nWho is correct?\n\nAccording to Payapl, if the seller does not respond within 8 days I automatically 'win' and will receive a refund. According to ebay, the seller has already responded, there is nothing more on their side that can be done. It appears I have no choice but to wait 8 days to receive my money back. It is only because I am certain I am due this refund, I have not requested a chargeback at my bank.\n\nThe ebay managed payment is not compatible with Paypal. Please sort it out. It is not obviously clear that if an item is purchased on ebay through paypal, any disputes must be made on ebay. Before ebay managed payments, if an item had been purchased on ebay with paypal, the buyer could open a claim on either platform. The seller themselves (not ebay) would then receive direct contact from Paypal in the form of an email and have direct access to the claim on their paypal account. Through ebay managed payments, the seller cannot see any dispute on their paypal account. They do not receive notification nor any correspondence from Paypal. So how in this instance can they reply satisfactorily to the claim? Who's fault is this?\n\nI've use Paypal for many years and never had any real problems. This has completely frustrated me and hope it resolves asap and never happens again.\n\nCASE ID - PP-D 87310484", 'review_date': '2020-10-14', 'review_time': '12:00:48', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

I bought four stools directly from a webshop and paid with Paypal. They arrived and were of poor quality, cheap rubbish. One of them had paint peeling off. I called the seller and explained that there was no way products of this quality would endure in a busy family kitchen. The seller told me they would collect but retain £30 of the refund because only one item had an actual fault and the other three were fine, tough luck. I explained the protection the Consumer Rights Act 2015 affords me, tough luck. Don't worry, I thought, I paid with Paypal! I availed myself of their Buyer Protection and filled in the forms. After more than 10 weeks of messing around, they found in favour of the seller (who was breaking the law).\n\nTo offer balance I have used Paypal for the thick end of 20 years and I have not had any problems.\n\nThe thing is this has been their first test and they have failed at every level.
