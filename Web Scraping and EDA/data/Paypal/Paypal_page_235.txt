I set up a new business so had to set up a whole new Paypal account to offer payments to customers. I thought I was doing the right thing. Offering a 3rd party payment for new customers who don't know me or my business and don't want to share their card details.\n\nHow wrong was I basically when your a new business and set up a new account Paypal make your wait 21 days and put a lock on your money so you cant get it for 21 days. unless you post tracking of following some other barmy policy. My order was for £10 I'm grateful for any order regardless of the amount. but for £10 the is a 95% chance the item will be sent and posted out. So why have ahold? Ahold for £250 and over then yes but not for £10. As it was only £10 for the total order. I have no tracking number for my customer. So now I won't get my money before 21 days. I'm going to call and complain to staff in the call centre tomorrow. as a new business, we rely on money now not nearly a month later that's disgusting. If this carries on I shall remove Paypal and have my Shopify merchant take all payments instead whereas I only need to wait 3 days to get my money.\n\nFor those that have never run a business reading this. say you have 5 orders all using payments that 105 days of waiting or more to get you money. Would employed people wait 105 days to get paid their OT? I don't think so. Money makes the world go round so thing carefully when you pay with paypal.", 'review_date': '2022-01-17', 'review_time': '22:52:45', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
