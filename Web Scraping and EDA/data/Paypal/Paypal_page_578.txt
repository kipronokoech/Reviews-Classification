I got a response to the effect of - case closed. The website is basically non functioning - it does not allow you to click and proceed and takes you down erroneous link contents that you did not click. For a test, I tried to report a problem for a different transaction, and a message popped up saying I couldn't as I already had a claim resolved. Hahaha emm that was for another transaction.
