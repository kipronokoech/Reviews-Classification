Someone unknown to me gained access to my paypal account and was able to put a transaction through of £150 ordering to an address that is at least 100 miles away from me, then deleted my paypal account. I have spent 4 hours in total on the phone to them over the past 3 weeks to still end up no better off. They send vague emails notifying you of the results of your claim that each time have literally just said “no unauthorised access”. When you call they fob you off and are desperate to get you off the phone. My email address is not one that you would be able to guess the spelling of yet several times I have phoned and just said it rather than spelling it and they said they have found my case. They have you spinning in circles with the amount of repeated questions they ask you, even if you have called 10 times before the staff don’t have any idea of any of the details of your claim so you have to completely start from the beginning and explain it all over again. I work in retail and have always hated people who complain about getting through to somebody who speaks little English but at paypal I believe they rely on this so that they can get you so frustrated you give up.\n3 weeks, 4 hours and £150 down I have not got the mental capacity to put up with phoning them again. As much as it disgusts me to think they are enabling criminals to literally take the money that feeds my children I would rather not spend another day on hold to, or talking to, their incompetent and unhelpful team.\nIt has to be said if you are able to get through to somebody in the Irish head office they seem to be the most ‘with it’ however the person on the phone ultimately is just an information taker, the (mysterious and elusive) “back office” team make the decisions and you aren’t able to speak to them so have to rely on all your information being passed on correctly.\nI have now contacted financial ombudsman as a last resort but I may aswell have thrown £150 and my will to live down the drain.', 'review_date': '2019-05-15', 'review_time': '23:05:17', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}

We had a return open with a buyer on eBay, we offer a 30 day return policy and honor it, 45 or so days after the buyer received the item. We and eBay closed the return, because of the 30 day policy. The buyer opened a claim with PayPal and we did not receive or see notice of the claim. PayPal gives buyer 100+ days to file a claim. We received a few days to review the claim and reply. Well, we did not see it until after the deadline. PayPal refunded the buyer $379.98 and did not have the buyer send us back the item. We did not receive a refund for the PayPal fees associated with this case. There is an "appeal the outcome" of this case within the closed case, but the only options are, "The buyer has already been refunded and I can provide proof of the previous refund" and "The item was returned but was not in the same condition as it was sent". We have contacted PayPal via phone and they state that we did not respond to the case when it was open so it was closed in their favor.
