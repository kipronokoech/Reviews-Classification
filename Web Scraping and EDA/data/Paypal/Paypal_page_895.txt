The first dress I paid $200 to be custom made with my measurements I provided and the colour and material I chose. The dress arrived with sizing multiple inches larger than mine (it literally falls off of me), a complete different material and colour, and altogether different style. It had been made horribly and had parts where the sewing was not finished, etc. I made it clear that I was happy to return the dress to the company for a full refund, and that I could provide countless photos to show the piece of s**t I had received, Paypal automatically ruled in the sellers favour a few hours later without even considering my side or asking for any photo evidence.\n\nThe second dress I bought was advertised as one size on ebay and was actually labelled a complete different size on the dress. The seller also made me pay for express post, yet sent it with a service that took 4 days (clearly not express). I tried resolving the issue directly with the seller and only continued to receive a bunch of lies an excuses. Paypal ruled in the sellers favour without considering my side or asking for any photos of tags or messages exchanged, even though I offered to provide everything.\n\nEarlier on in the year, I sold my brothers iphone on ebay. He had had it for less than 6 months, hardly used it, and I had had it checked both at home and at my local apple store to make sure it worked before listing it on ebay. I sent the item off, and within a few minutes of the package being received (as tracking showed the time it was delivered), the buyer opened a case and completely lied about the state of the phone, claiming internal damages and colour difference. They also made up a story about how they had had it checked at the store (magically in the 3 minutes between receiving and opening the case) and that it had damage and was a knockoff. I asked for photos to be provided of the colour difference and a transcript from the apple store to show what was apparently wrong with the item, as well as provided the purchase receipt from where it was bought and when it had a check up a few days prior. Paypal immediately ruled in the buyers favour. The person who bought it had a history of selling apple products (I could see in their feedback) so it was blatantly obvious that they were trying to screw me over because they thought I was competition (which was only more obvious when they left negative feedback even though I fully refunded them).\n\nThis is only 3 stories out of many.\n\nI hate paypal more than I can even begin to describe, and this review would be peppered with expletives if it was allowed. Their customer service is useless, they always answer with "wow I can see here that you\'re a top customer, thanks for being a long term customer with paypal" and then they are completely useless at solving any problems. The dispute service is horrendous, paypal never even considers both sides, and seems to always choose the side that gives NO evidence for their claim, despite me providing endless evidence I am always ruled against.\n\nMy IP address has also been blocked, and I can no longer use paypal on my home wifi (on either the laptop, computer, or my phone), and have to wait until I am at my boyfriends house or uni - I have checked this with my service provider and they have confirmed that the block has come from paypals side of things. I have contacted paypal about this and they have been completely useless, telling me to "get a stronger internet connection", when I have NO problem with any other websites and my service provider has been explicit in the fact that it is on paypals end.\n\nOverall, this company is definitely the worst piece of you know what that I have ever dealt with, and I am definitely looking for a new payment method to use.', 'review_date': '2014-07-15', 'review_time': '03:12:26', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
