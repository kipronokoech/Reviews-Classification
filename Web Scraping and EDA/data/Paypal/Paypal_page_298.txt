If you can avoid stay away from PayPal it is not using friendly nor will they protect you as a customer I have learned my lesson it was quite a expensive one as in the time of this pandemic I am already suffering, just lost my God daughter at a very young age of 26 years old about to lose this house and be homeless, all because there is no plan or no type of process for PayPal to get misdirected money back to me as a customer", 'review_date': '2021-08-03', 'review_time': '19:36:27', 'CompanyReply': None, 'CompanyReplyDate': None, 'CompanyReplyTime': None}
